30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/30/victoria-beckham-reverses-decision-to-furlough-fashion-label-staff,fashion, Victoria Beckham reverses decision to furlough fashion label staff, Exclusive: application to use public money to support staff is withdrawn following criticism, Following a change of heart by the designer and her board  the application to the government scheme has been withdrawn and all employees concerned restored to their roles. “We will not now be drawing on the government furlough scheme ” Beckham told the Guardian. “At the beginning of the lockdown the shareholders agreed with senior management to furlough a small proportion of staff. At that point we didn’t know how long the lockdown might last or its likely impact on the business. The welfare of my team and our business means everything to me.” After going into lockdown “overnight”  the company “made decisions as best we could to try and protect our staff”  according to a spokesperson. “We’ve now reconsidered and we accept there’s a better way forward for our business. These are tough times and tough decisions and we don’t always get it right - all we can say is we are trying to protect our business and our staff.” A fortnight ago  30 of Beckham’s 120 staff received letters informing them they were to be furloughed for at least two months. Beckham  whose net worth is estimated at £335m and who had been sharing images on social media from the family’s luxury lockdown at home in Oxfordshire when the news broke  was heavily criticised for a claim which would have cost about £150 000 in government funds. The furlough scheme has becoming a lightning rod for high emotion around how the huge economic burden of the crisis is to be shared between taxpayers and wealthy individuals and businesses. Beckham’s reversal follows a pattern seen at Liverpool and Tottenham football clubs. Both initially announced they would furlough non-playing staff  applying to the government-funded job retention scheme for financial support  but subsequently had a change of heart. In a letter to fans the Liverpool’s chief executive  Peter Moore  said: “We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.” However  a source close to Beckham denied that the reversal had been prompted by the backlash  saying that she “is well aware of the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye  and doesn’t complain about it”. A spokesperson for the board said that the company “now believe that with the support of our shareholders  we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme”. Online sales of Victoria Beckham clothing since lockdown have exceeded the revised forecasts drawn up by the business at the onset of the crisis  and although Britain remains in lockdown crucial links in the international supply chain are now emerging from mothballing. All of the Italian factories which produce the label’s garments are scheduled to be up and running by 11 May. Beckham is said to be keen to get back to designing the next collection – although the catwalk schedule is currently on pause  with fashion weeks in June and July cancelled and the major September shows in London  New York  Milan and Paris likely to be scaled down  postponed  or otherwise reimagined. The backtracking reflects signs of cautious optimism in the fashion industry  as some regions of the globe begin the process of reopening after the crisis. Predictions that quarantine would cause seismic shifts in consumer behaviour and snuff out demand for fashion and luxury in the long term are being called into question by recent reports from China. On 11 April  the first day of reopening  the Hermes boutique in Guangzhou took $2.7m  the brand’s highest ever single day takings. The phenomenon is being dubbed “revenge spending”. The furore highlights the delicate position that Victoria Beckham and her brand occupy in British public life. As a designer she has a huge brand name  but a relatively small business. Against the global luxury giants against whom she competes for customers  her label is a minnow. Having taken £30m in investment from Neo Investment Holdings three years ago  the designer and her husband own 47% of her label  with the majority owned by the board. The brand has established itself as one of the most respected and influential fashion houses on the show circuit  but has yet to turn a profit. The family star power of “Brand Beckham” brings her label the kind of public interest most designers can only dream of. The front row line-up of David Beckham and the couple’s four children next to Anna Wintour has become an iconic fashion week image. But the Beckhams’ status brings with it an expectation that Victoria is to be judged not as a fashion designer  but as a public figure. Before this crisis  the label is thought to have been on course to break even this year. Beckham has foregone her salary for the foreseeable future  and she and other shareholders are planning to put in more investment to keep the business functioning through the crisis. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6eb2695a25845f652e57d85721ec3ecb70d0751/0_280_2206_1323/master/2206.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78f6a78c48634326270c1aed032abf19 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2383b4b15a61da90a1b79d8a3b15c1866ca84334/193_141_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba633bcd1ace82ff75fd3b67e9883171 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f427a8f9acd4ff3ff7aa840201423030fdc823f4/2191_148_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efc92e54c8e2c753ea45d180fd981502 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Fashion%2CVictoria+Beckham%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson,politics, Johnson promises plan next week for return to schools and work, PM says UK is past peak of coronavirus and vows to produce road map for economy, Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus  taking it to a total of 26 771  the prime minister suggested the worst was over. “I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope ” he said  three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself. Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital  the prime minister at times appeared breathless. He robustly defended his government’s handling of the outbreak  after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. “We’re learning lessons every day – but I do think that  broadly speaking  we did the right thing at the right time ” he said. Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner  he said: “Don’t forget  it’s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do – very tough – and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.” Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a “comprehensive plan” setting out “how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy”. However  he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control. “What you are going to get next week is really a road map  a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic  what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.” The Labour leader  Keir Starmer  welcomed the prime minister’s statement  after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its “exit strategy” – though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase. “I’ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy ” Starmer said. “We’ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he’s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it  and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan. We’ll look at it when we see it  but it’s a step in the right direction.” The government’s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing  and a sustained fall in the death rate. But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R  the reproduction number for the virus  measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects. The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1  but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment  the government’s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9. England’s chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  urged caution  saying: “As soon as R goes over one  then you restart exponential growth – it may be slow if it is just over one  it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one – but exponential growth restarts and  sooner or later – and the higher it is  the sooner it is – the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.” One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5 000 per day – the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing. However  the UK is quite some way off that goal. The official figures show at least 6 000 people tested positive on Wednesday  but the real number is likely to be much higher than that because many cases in the community are not being tested. The Scottish first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  told the Scottish public on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that there would be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. “It is likely by the time we get to this time next week  which is the 7 May review day  it will not be possible in any meaningful way to lift these restrictions ” she said. “We have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts. But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.” In Whitehall  ministers have been scrambling to draw up plans for the next phase of the crisis  which Johnson’s deputy  Dominic Raab  has described as a “new normal”  rather than a return to the pre-lockdown life. Johnson said for the first time on Thursdaythat this could include the public being advised to wear face masks. Asked about the issue  the prime minister said: “I do think face masks will be useful  both for epidemiological reasons  and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.” His remarks contradicted the stance of some cabinet colleagues. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  said earlier this week there was only “weak science” supporting the use of face masks. The Cabinet Office minister  Michael Gove  warned on Wednesday they might tempt people to behave in a “cavalier” manner. The mayor of London  Sadiq Khan  welcomed the government’s apparent change of heart  saying: “I am pleased that the prime minister has said that non-medical face coverings will play an important role as we eventually look to lift lockdown restrictions. This is something I and others have been pushing the government to change the guidance on.” Downing Street believes more people could safely return to work even before the lockdown is formally lifted  if distancing measures are complied with. Some manufacturers  including the car maker Rolls-Royce  have restarted production lines – and the DIY chain B&Q announced on Wednesday that it would reopen its stores. The chancellor  Rishi Sunak  has been keen to see more of the economy reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the unprecedented measures introduced to help firms and households weather the crisis will cost £104bn in this financial year. Asked whether meeting the costs would mean a fresh round of austerity when the outbreak was over  Johnson insisted it would not  saying: “That will certainly not be part of our approach.” “I think the economy will want to bounce back strongly. I think that this government will want to encourage that bounceback in all kinds of ways ” he said. In preparation for an easing of lockdown restrictions  the business secretary  Alok Sharma  is drawing up guidance for safe working in different types of setting. Business groups and unions are expecting to see a first draft of this weekend. The education secretary  Gavin Williamson  has been examining plans for what he has called a “phased” reopening of schools. Testing for coronavirus has increased significantly in recent days as eligibility has been extended to new groups  with 81 611 tests carried out on Wednesday  according to the Department of Health and Social Care  although only 54 575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90 000. It will not be clear until Friday afternoon whether Hancock has met his self-imposed target of 100 000 tests a day by the end of April. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83565fea77c4eb9107418359dbd125e40a195/845_1327_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7552e116e5d1db85120e82637abe2a7d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CBoris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/entire-order-of-250-chinese-ventilators-were-useless-despite,uk-news, Entire UK order of 250 Chinese ventilators ditched over danger to lives, Doctors found breathing kits were so badly made they feared they could kill patients, All of the devices in a consignment of 250 ventilators that arrived from China on 4 April posed such serious problems that they could not be used and were ditched. Doctors in NHS hospitals in the West Midlands  among which the ventilators were shared  were so concerned that they wrote to Matt Hancock  the health secretary  warning that they could kill patients. “We believe that if used  significant patient harm  including death  is likely ” they wrote in a letter  which was obtained by NBC News. “We look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients.” The medics warned the Department of Health and Social Care that the oxygen supply in the devices was “variable and unreliable”  their build quality was “basic”  the oxygen connection base was marked as “non-EU” and their fabric case made them hard to clean. The machines were Shangrila 510 ventilators made by Beijing Aeonmed  a major manufacturer of ventilators in China. They were designed for use in ambulances not hospitals  the doctors said. The day they arrived  Michael Gove  the Cabinet Office minister who is helping to co-ordinate the government’s response to the pandemic  thanked China for sending them. “We’ve been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad  including Germany and Switzerland  and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese government ” he said at the government’s daily news conference  in comments that were widely reported. However  hospitals that then received the devices could not get them to work  despite technical staff spending several days trying to do so. A senior official at one of the hospitals involved said: “All of the ventilators failed. Nothing worked. They didn’t have proper oxygen centres and the tubing didn’t fit. We were irate. All the hospitals tried to get them to work but we couldn’t. “At the time we were really worried  because we feared that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 needing to be ventilated. Happily  as it turned out we didn’t get quite as many as originally expected so we didn’t need the Chinese ventilators after all  which is just as well.” The ventilators were part of a government drive to increase the NHS’s supply of ventilators from the 8 000 it had before the virus struck  to 30 000  so that anyone needing one during the expected peak of the pandemic could have one while in intensive care. However  that target has since been reduced as hospitals have been able to manage the number of people with Covid-19 needing their care. A well-placed NHS source said the incident highlighted problems that had occurred with a range of medical supplies and equipment ordered from China during the coronavirus pandemic. “Some other stuff ordered from China recently  especially personal protective equipment  has also turned out to be either of a lesser quality than what we need or to be the wrong thing altogether  like T-shirts instead of long-sleeved surgical gowns ” they said. “You have to be careful who you procure stuff from  because the supply and then what ultimately arrives can be very variable. But  then again  we didn’t have enough ventilators to start with because the government was unprepared for coronavirus  so we had to ask China to help.” NBC News reported that it approached the international sales manager for Beijing Aeonmed  who said: “I don’t know ” when asked whether the company was aware of the concerns about its product  before the call ended. The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for its response. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4d39c3937249488ea38d38833cb7e87b02b253/440_1317_1647_988/master/1647.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a21571c67f63d2b89d6a98d943590351 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CMichael+Gove%2CMatt+Hancock%2CChina%2CHospitals%2CNHS%2CDoctors%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds,business, UK watchdog vows to get tough with UK firms over stalled refunds, Move comes after complaints about cancelled holidays and weddings owing to Covid-19, The Competition and Markets Authority has recorded a rise in customer complaints about cancellations and refunds  which it said it would now investigate. It highlighted concerns that firms are refusing refunds or pressuring people to accept vouchers for holiday accommodation that can only be used during a more expensive period. Complaints about cancellations and refunds account for four out of five complaints received by its Covid-19 taskforce. They relate mainly to three areas: weddings and private events; holiday accommodation; and nurseries and childcare providers. The watchdog will tackle these areas first and then move on to other sectors. Thousands of flights have also been cancelled during the pandemic  but this does not fall under the CMA’s investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority  which regulates airlines  has issued advice to travellers and said they should contact it with specific questions. The CMA said that most businesses are “acting reasonably in what are unprecedented circumstances”  but added that consumer rights cannot be ignored. Andrea Coscelli  the chief executive of the CMA  said: “Our Covid-19 taskforce is shining a light on some of the big issues facing consumers in wake of this pandemic. Alongside price-gouging reports  we’re now seeing cancellation issues in their thousands. So far  the CMA has identified weddings  holiday accommodation and childcare as particular areas of concern. “The current situation is throwing up challenges for everyone  including businesses  but that does not mean that consumer rights can fall by the wayside. If we find evidence that businesses are failing to comply with consumer protection law then we will get tough – that means launching enforcement cases and moving to court action where there is a strong reason to do so.” For most consumer contracts  the CMA would expect a full refund to be issued where a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services; no service is provided by a firm; or a consumer cancels or is prevented from receiving the service  for example because of the restrictions imposed by the lockdown. The watchdog said the rights to a refund will usually apply even where the consumer has paid what the business says is a non-refundable deposit or advance payment. It accepts that it may take businesses longer than normal to process refunds  but urged them to make the timeframes clear to customers. A spokesperson added that it would not expect consumers to have to wait “weeks and weeks or even months” for a refund. Salman Haqqi  personal finance expert at online comparison service Money.co.uk  said: “Now is the time for holiday companies  insurers and airlines to step up and provide better options for holidaymakers at this difficult time and form an industry standard response. “This will help people understand what they are entitled to if their holiday has been or is likely to be cancelled. Banks also have a role to play here and support where they can.” The CMA also advised that businesses should not be profiting by “double recovering” their money from the government and customers. Consumer association Which? meanwhile called on the Civil Aviation Authority to clamp down on airlines which were still not refunding passengers. Rory Boland  of Which? Travel  said: “While the CAA is right to remind airlines of their legal obligations to refund passengers for cancelled flights  incidents of carriers openly breaking the law are mounting up and people are being left thousands of pounds out of pocket as a result – so it is clear that more needs to be done to hold airlines to account. ”Asking airlines to issue refunds ‘as soon as practically possible’ does nothing to remedy this  and risks giving too much leeway… the regulator must stand up for passengers’ rights.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8d6ac950a691727af69c5efa469a8d3885c694/0_188_5700_3423/master/5700.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=579b8a1aef2ee8cbd1f05524d7faa7c7 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Travel+%26+leisure%2CConsumer+rights%2CWeddings%2CHotels%2CBusiness%2CLife+and+style%2CTravel%2CChildcare%2CMoney%2CUK+news%2CCompetition+and+Markets+Authority%2CRegulators https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser,world, 'He’s just a wonderful man': how Captain Tom became a superstar fundraiser, The public’s huge response to the 100-year-old  who has raised £32m for the NHS  shows how much it needs some good news, The release included a photograph of the then 99-year-old wearing a navy blue fleece  pushing a walking frame on which was balanced a panama hat and his stick. “We are all being rightly advised to stay home  stay safe and protect our NHS  and that is exactly what local 99-year-old Tom Moore is doing ” the copy began – and  with it  one of the most startlingly successful fundraising stories of our time. How exactly a centenarian managed to capture a nation’s heart – prompting an RAF fly-by  an upgrade in military rank and Piers Morgan pledging ten grand of his own money  not to mention an array of conspiracy theories – is a tale that proves both the ongoing power of the mainstream media and the British public’s hunger for joy during a time of bleak national crisis. The global media onslaught began in Milton Keynes  where the press release caught the eye of Damien Lucas  head of news for a group of local newspapers. Within a few hours the story was on Bedford Today  with a headline about the ambitions of a “Bedford man” and his 100th birthday challenge  inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after breaking his hip and for skin cancer. A local ITV report followed and by 10 April  Good Friday  Captain Tom was live on BBC Breakfast. “You have lived  and you have seen some tough times in this country  can you inspire people who are watching now  just reassure them  it will be fine?” asked Naga Munchetty. “Remember ” he said  “tomorrow is a good day  tomorrow you will maybe find everything will be much better than today.” A star was born. The BBC Breakfast team watched  staggered  as donations to Captain Tom’s Just Giving Page went from £1 000 to a million and beyond. Before long  their rivals on Good Morning Britain had picked up the story  with Piers Morgan pledging £10 000 of his own money. Back in Marston Moretaine  a small village 12 miles from Milton Keynes  journalists and well-wishers began congregating outside the house Captain Tom shares with Hannah and her family  hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero doing his laps. On 16 April Moore finished his challenge live on BBC Breakfast surrounded by a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. By 20 April he had raised over £20m and had recorded a duet with Michael Ball that was on its way to number one in the charts. The family began to worry about crowds outside the house. A neighbour got a number for DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles to see if he could help. Hannah  a huge DIY SOS fan  texted asking if this was really Nick Knowles. He suggested a Facetime call to prove his identity and soon had arranged for a fence to be put up outside the family garden  according to Megan Carver  Knowles’s longtime PR. Carver came on board last week to help field inquiries for free. One of her first calls was to Schillings  the notorious London libel firm  famed for its sky-high fees and celebrity clientele. “It was probably the easiest phone call I’ve ever made ” said Carver. “I explained that Captain Tom’s family needed a bit of help and Schillings immediately said  yes  and of course this will be pro bono.” Schillings contacted Ipso  the press regulator  to ask journalists to stop “either leaning over the fence or placing their long-focus-lens cameras through hedges to take intrusive photographs”  noting that the family had set up a Twitter account  @captaintommoore containing images that could be used for free. Then came the backlash. The family had to refute claims that they or Maytrix were profiting from the fundraising. A virulent Whatsapp message had spread  claiming they were lining their own pockets and accusing JustGiving  the fundraising platform  of keeping up to £2m. Full Fact  the independent fact-checking charity  reported JustGiving was in fact taking around 1% of the total: around £320 000 of the £32m pledged by Thursday late afternoon for NHS Charities Together. Back at the village  the family could no longer cope with the deluge of cards and presents arriving from around the world. Bill Chandi  the local postmaster  stepped in to help  offering his post office as their correspondence address. “Since then I have been working 24/7 and it is my honour to do so ” said Chandi. Bedford school  where Captain Tom’s grandson Benji is a pupil  offered its school hall to house the cards. By Thursday they were spilling out into the classrooms too. “He’s already received at least 160 000 cards ” said Chandi. “Quite a few people want to make sure they definitely get to the right place so they send them recorded delivery  which means we have to log them all in the post office – we don’t sign for them because of social distancing.” The local sorting office has had to set up a separate “Captain Tom” team with two or three dedicated workers  he added. On Thursday  Captain Tom became Colonel Tom  promoted to an honorary role by the British Army. Boris Johnson wished him happy birthday  the Queen sent her customary telegram and a wartime Spitfire and Hurricane flew over Marston Moretaine. He has been the perfect hero for our times  says BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani. “There’s nothing self-centred or grandiose about Captain Tom. He’s just a wonderful man. You can tell it has hit a nerve with viewers when they are looking for something to rally around. He brings a little bit of good news and light into what are very difficult times.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Helen-Pidd,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1cd6a033e1bd1c940a296ab06e44b124 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e5b503e665373ec1ce3993afb1b7b16880f9c4/0_33_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dbc79c7468f0fd63a8dc7237343964fa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3a120ab7dc58c60e2abc80e5b0aa76d2dd51d1b/184_0_2482_1491/master/2482.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=469de668db9c9e637649e40c028aa929 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a029b63686cac3b73b01a97bb7cb2710be379c19/0_153_5346_3207/master/5346.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da09550da091ef94f7253f53cc5cc192 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f20ca397be841f87185e417064da321550e75cc/0_408_5399_3240/master/5399.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c2f2fda3913c0c5be86ffa760215aed https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8124117a5dfe75c24e3fc0e4fd702b071c883e1/102_0_1547_928/master/1547.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=458ffd7c80167754234db2d03798920d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CCharities%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-police-receive-200000-calls-from-lockdown-snitchers,world, UK police receive 194 000 calls from lockdown 'snitches', Police chiefs says people finding it harder to observe measures the longer they go on, The figures from the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) give an insight into how the tough rules  and fears of the virus spreading  have affected communities. Sara Glen  a deputy chief constable who is part of the NPCC’s leadership tackling coronavirus  said: “We have members of the public who are coming in on the phones and [via the internet] to report where they’ve got concerns either at gatherings of people that they can see from their locations  or if they think people aren’t adhering to the regulations and that’s actually putting them at risk.” Some of the calls about lockdown rules allegedly being broken are counted in figures on reports of antisocial behaviour  which surged to around 215 000 in the four weeks to 27 April  compared with about 106 000 in the same period last year. Glen said concerns were also being raised about what was going on in other people’s households  such as possible domestic or child abuse. Five weeks since laws enforcing the lockdown began  and with a decision looming about an extension soon  police said it was getting harder for people to comply. The NPCC chair  Martin Hewitt  said: “I think it is inevitable that people will get restless  this is now quite an extended period of time.” He said last weekend police saw more traffic and people out  but compliance levels were the same. “I just think there is an inevitability that as the weeks progress  this is harder for people  and we are moving into warmer weather.” Increasing numbers of fines are being issued for infringing lockdown . In the two weeks to 13 April   which included the long Easter weekend  4 152 fines were issued in England alone  and in the next fortnight there were 4 725 fines. Two-thirds of the fines are being given to people aged under 34  and eight out of 10 to men. Fines start at £60  reduced to £30 for prompt payment  and further breaches can lead to costs doubling each time  to a maximum of £960. Some 391 people were fined more than once. One person has been fined six times  three people have been fined five times  six people fined four times and 343 fined twice. Glen said “troublesome spots” include beaches and rural communities in the countryside where people want to walk. Officers have been accused at times of heavy handedness for setting up checkpoints  shaming people with drones and in some cases getting confused by the new laws  leading to people being wrongly prosecuted or fined. But Hewitt said so far 0.02% of population had been fined – around one in every 5 000 people – supporting the impression of large-scale adherence to the lockdown  and police leaders believe their policy of enforcement being a last resort has worked. NPCC figures show a postcode lottery of enforcement. Thames Valley police recorded the highest number of fines  649  while the biggest force  the Met in London  issued 634. Warwickshire issued 22 fines  the fewest of any force. Dorset issued 116 but next door in Devon and Cornwall there were 510 fines. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15527e30010996c8d581cbc502d027a776892501/0_88_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a24ce4afd51900b06476083e18659a23 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Police%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify,world, What does the 'R' number of coronavirus actually signify?, One figure in particular is being closely scrutinised as ministers decide when to end lockdown, At the start of the coronavirus epidemic  the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu  but lower than for measles. That means that each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average  before either recovering or dying  and each of those people would each pass it on to a further two to three others  causing the total number of cases to snowball over time. The reproduction number is not fixed  though. It depends both on the biology of the virus  but also our behaviour  such as social distancing. It also depends on the population’s immunity. At the start of an outbreak scientists often refer to the “basic reproductive number”  R0  which is a similar measure to R  but starts with the premise that the population has zero immunity through infection or vaccination. Under the current lockdown restrictions  R is now estimated to have dropped to somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. This means that the epidemic is shrinking – although not uniformly. The figure given for London is 0.5 to 0.7  with some parts of the UK having a higher or lower figure. There is no obvious answer for what R needs to be in order for the lockdown to be lifted. That depends on how low ministers want the total number of cases to be if the government is to be able to effectively track and trace new cases. It is also not clear precisely how easing different restrictions will influence R – there is still uncertainty about how much schools contribute to transmission  for instance. So real-time tracking of transmission will be needed to continue providing a rolling estimate. Because once R inches above 1  even just a fraction  the number of cases will start sharply rising again  putting the UK on the path to a substantial second surge. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68af99c0fe89fcf5e6083e77e2aa082ea14c0b50/317_101_2683_1611/master/2683.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ada879a2b815e3e4d47d992dcc8f01a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CScience%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses,world, Johnson promises 'comprehensive plan' for reopening businesses, Detailed guidelines on working during coronavirus lockdown coming next week  says PM, Large parts of the economy remain closed because of concerns that companies may not be able to adequately protect their workers  but the government is keen for firms to return to work where possible in order to cushion the blow to the economy. The government is due to announce its latest decision on whether to extend lockdown conditions on 7 May  although there is little expectation of any major relaxation of rules  with health services still under pressure. However  the prime minister on Thursday said he expected to present “a comprehensive plan” on how to get the UK economy moving as well as providing childcare for workers  allowing travel to work and allowing safer work within businesses. The business secretary  Alok Sharma  has been gathering views from businesses and lobby groups on guidelines that should be implemented  giving details of how different sectors should adapt. The advice is expected to cover different types of workplace  such as factories  offices  shops  logistics and outdoor work such as farming and mining. While there is no legal impediment to companies returning to work – aside from non-essential retail and public venues that have been explicitly shut down – some businesses are concerned they could face a backlash in the absence of a clear signal from the government. Here is how the different anti-coronavirus measures could work: Any work that cannot be done with social distancing should be done with workers standing either back to back or side by side – rather than face to face. Cleaning of work surfaces will be more regular and shifts should be staggered to prevent large congregations of workers at factory gates or in rest areas – in which 2-metre distancing will be enforced. The carmaker Vauxhall has made face masks and eye protection compulsory at all times. However  sources in other industries have said the government is unlikely to mandate this across the country  given the need to prioritise personal protective equipment for the NHS. There is little prospect of a return to working en masse in offices in the coming weeks  with working from home still encouraged among those who can do so. However  for those who must return to offices  desks will be spaced out and start times could be staggered to prevent rush hour crowding on public transport. Britons have already become familiar with distancing requirements in shops deemed essential by the government. The British Retail Consortium and the Usdaw union have drawn up guidance that covers issues ranging from limiting access to public toilets  to the installation of protective screens at tills and keeping changing rooms permanently closed in clothes shops in order to prevent contamination. Warehouses and trucking companies have been in demand like never before as people are stuck at home. Within warehouses safe practices are almost identical to factories  while delivery drivers who interact with consumers as part of their job need to wait for the customer to pick up packages at a safe distance. In farms  quarries and mines  workers should work side by side if they are unable to carry out their jobs 2 metres apart  and enclosed spaces such as machinery cabs should have windows left open to allow for ventilation. The sale of goods – such as farm produce – should not encourage the gathering of crowds  with online orders and deliveries recommended. Some housebuilders had faced protests over continuing work during lockdown  with concerns that some parts of the job are impossible to do while maintaining 2-metre distancing. However  the housing minister  Robert Jenrick  last week gave clear guidance to the construction industry that it should return to work if possible. The housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is manufacturing a bespoke face shield  which will attach to a construction hard hat and will be used on all its sites for two-person tasks. Large sites such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will have split shifts to reduce overlap. While transport is not thought to be among the sectors to be covered by new business department guidance  any large move back to work will require more public transport. Bus and train companies are hoping for continued government funding to allow them to operate with empty seats – a costly move – to preserve 2-metre distances. Any recovery of the airline industry is likely to be more reliant on international agreements. However  the Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air on Thursday said masks would be compulsory on its flights from now on  with limited flights to resume from Luton airport on 1 May. The Ryanair boss  Michael O’Leary  has rejected the idea of leaving the middle seat empty on planes in order to maintain physical distancing. There is little expectation that public gatherings will be allowed for months  given the focus on reducing the potential for coronavirus to spread. The JD Wetherspoon pub chain plans to reopen in June  although few analysts believe that is likely. Any pre-vaccine reopening would need strict social distancing and cleaning routines – if customers could be persuaded to return. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CUK+news%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/breathless-boris-is-left-floundering-as-he-faces-foe-he-cant-outbluster,politics, Breathless Boris is left floundering as he faces foe he can't outbluster, At his comeback virus briefing the PM repeats same old words  but even he struggles to believe them, The Boss may be back  but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words  but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life  there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror  he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment. His persona that has been carefully constructed over 55 years to protect himself from the pain of being himself is falling apart. Yet still he can’t quite access the humility that might go some way to healing himself. Not that Boris didn’t give it his best shot at papering over the cracks  but it cost him dear. By the end of the press conference he was just two pinprick  bloodshot eyes peeping out of an ashen-white face. If he really feels the need to get back to work so soon  then he can’t have much faith in the rest of his cabinet. There again  that’s one area where you can’t really fault his judgment. “I’m not going to minimise the lack of personal protective equipment or the failure to expedite testing ” he said. Before proceeding to do just that. The lack of PPE and adequate testing – today was the day we were supposed to have reached 100 000 daily tests – have been two of the leading factors in the UK’s mortality rate  but according to Boris the government hadn’t put a foot wrong. The lack of an apology becomes more insulting by the day to the families of the nearly 27 000 people who have died. It appears that the only people in the entire country not to have heard of the 2016 Exercise Cygnus  that highlighted the risks of a pandemic  are the entire government frontbench. Rejoice  rejoice. Sunlight was visible. We had avoided the worst-case scenario of 500 000 dead by burrowing under the alpine mountain. Boris appeared to have both forgotten that we were already well past the 20 000 “best-case result” of his chief scientific adviser  Patrick Vallance  and that – even allowing for statistical variations – the UK had a fatality rate significantly higher than that of Germany or South Korea and might even have the worst record of any country in Europe. The line that the government did the right things at the right time becomes ever more untenable. What can’t be admitted is that Boris effectively took a 10-day holiday in March  at a time when he could have done more to protect the country. Seldom has so much been owed by so few to so many. Boris then breezed on to the R rate – AKA the reproduction rate. Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK’s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9  no one has the first idea of Boris’s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six – though even Boris doesn’t appear to know if it’s more – and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly. On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one. Even Vallance and England’s chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  couldn’t help Boris out with that one. The only certainty was more uncertainty. The questions only revealed how little everyone really knew  as Boris had no clear answers to anything. He couldn’t say anything on tourism to Cornwall – “there will be more information later” – and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum. Even if you’re really desperate  you’re lucky to get an appointment inside six months these days. An embarrassed Whitty eventually had to intervene and point people in the direction of mental health charities if they needed urgent help. Otherwise  there was just more of the same. The scientists urging caution while Boris talked big about the economy bouncing back  avoiding the second peak and enforcing the wearing of face masks which only a month ago he had said were a waste of time. But deep down  Boris knows he’s met his match. Up till now  he’s never found a situation in his life which he couldn’t bluster his way out of. Now he’s come up against a power greater than himself; coronavirus is so far immune to almost everything. In a straight contest between coronavirus and bullshit  the coronavirus wins every time.  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d5b9070b0be6cb46794d0e80e54f84debf42cd6/0_170_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0574d7a281fe9727440e6cd09518c914 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/i-feel-completely-lost-families-tell-of-covid-19-care-home-deaths,world, 'I feel completely lost': families tell of Covid-19 care home deaths, Fearing for  and losing  loved ones in locked-down homes has left relatives with anger and confusion, “We thought he was safer than any of us ” said June Findlater  whose 98-year-old father  David Thorburn  died from Covid-19 on Tuesday morning in a council care home near Glasgow. Three weeks ago  families were told the virus had arrived in the home with the shocking news a resident was dead. David  a “very dignified” former engineering lecturer and Robert Burns enthusiast who “enjoyed his meals”  was suddenly at risk. “It was the first we heard ” said June. “My heart sank. I knew there would be panic. Then there was another death. We started to think ‘oh  no’. Plus dad had a new cough.” Information about what was happening was hard to glean and sometimes apparently contradictory. Last Wednesday  the message was that David was sitting up singing songs; the next day he stopped eating and drinking. “It was awful ” June said. “I wanted to go in [wearing] a black bin liner – home-made. We struggled to get feedback from staff. It’s not about blame  we just wanted to be communicated with.” What the family had not been told was that the GP had already concluded that David was suffering from Covid-19  and had written a prescription to treat him. They only found out four days later. “We know the care was good  but the communication has left us so disappointed.” He died peacefully on Tuesday morning. But for June  who is still trying to find out exactly what happened  one thing is already clear: the residents were “sitting ducks”. It was midnight on Easter Sunday when Diana Samuels last saw her husband  Harvey. The 82-year-old had died 90 minutes earlier of suspected Covid-19 in a care home in Harrow. For weeks  the only contact between them had been a weekly 20-minute WhatsApp video call. That was all that the home would arrange for residents during lockdown. Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link. “It was just so weird ” she said. “You are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock  I couldn’t believe it.” He looked blue  which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia  but otherwise had been reasonably healthy. Diana was full of praise for the care staff: “They are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.” She has been left feeling angry at the home’s management  though  because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection  she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen. “I feel absolutely gutted ” she said. “I feel completely lost. It is like a bad dream for me. I was not told he was going into a decline. They didn’t tell me they thought he wasn’t going to live. I could have spoken to him. I feel so let down by it all.” She said his death was ascribed to dementia on the death certificate  but his symptoms and the speed of his decline indicated Covid-19. The last proper conversation she had with him was on the Thursday before Easter when he told her he didn’t feel well. “I told him I loved him and he told me he loved me.” “I have been sick with anxiety ” said Susan Birch  whose mother  Ruby Birch  was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 22 April in her Birmingham care home. It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week. Ruby  76  who suffers from mental health problems  relied on social contact and entertainment in the home. All that was gone. The family sent in a mobile phone. “Every time I speak to her I bear in mind there may not be another chance ” Susan said. “I don’t know if she is going to take a turn for the worse. I try to make the most of it and listen to everything she says. I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.” One day  Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype. The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on “snatched phone conversations with care workers”. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her. “I saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on ” she said. “We are trying to source some from my husband’s employer in Brighton. He works for a company now using 3D printers to produce face shields. Hopefully these will be delivered soon.” Sheila Yasamee  96  a former midwife and mother of five  has lived in a care home in Bexhill  East Sussex  since September. But after the first Covid-19 death there last week and more infections this week  her family are considering getting her out. “It’s extremely difficult ” said her daughter  Fara Yasamee. “It may well come down to life or death. This is spreading and [puts] her health and life in real danger … She may die there because of it.” The local GP has stressed that Sheila needs 24-hour care and equipment which cannot be guaranteed beyond the care home  and the local social care officials insist the choice is Sheila’s. Plus her family realise that they would have to go into isolation to look after her to avoid infecting her themselves – and that could go on for months. Sheila “does not really understand the situation and can’t make an informed decision about whether to stay or not”  Fara said. Her mother was “getting very low and depressed being in isolation and not seeing family … She keeps asking  how much longer is this going on?” Since visits were stopped  Fara has spoken to Sheila regularly by phone but it is becoming frustrating not knowing what care is being delivered  what personal protective equipment staff are using  whether workers are sick or how many people are looking after her mother. “I get the feeling that the care home is not being that transparent ” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation. It feels like whatever decision we take is not going to be right.” On 20 April  Katrina Wheeler heard that coronavirus had entered the care home where her 81-year-old mother  Pat  lives 300 miles away. It meant Pat and the other residents would be confined to their rooms indefinitely. “She feels that she is imprisoned ” said Katrina. “She knows why  but she can’t make the connection with her being on her own.” Pat  who has mental health difficulties  is struggling without being able to see her closest friend in the home  with whom she used to share much of her time. “I feel guilty that I can’t take her away from the environment and make her safe ” said Katrina. She also spoke of difficulty getting information about how the outbreak is being handled. “They are not being forthcoming ” she said. “They are probably extremely busy and it’s the last thing on their mind  but information is really important in terms of what is going on.” On Tuesday this week they were told that Pat was being tested for Covid-19 after showing symptoms. “She might not test positive but she is going to be in isolation until at least the end of the year ” said Katrina. “How is she going to be able to cope with that?” “It was just awful  it’s devastating ” said Dr Cathy Gardner. A carer at her father’s care home 150 miles away had called twice to say her 88-year-old father  Michael Gibson  was deteriorating with probable Covid-19 and she should come. After driving as fast as they could from Devon to the care home in Bicester  Gardner and her husband decided they could not go in and risk her mother catching the virus. So they looked at Michael  a former superintendent registrar of births  marriages and deaths  through the window instead. “It’s not what you expect the situation to be at the end of someone’s life and you can’t be there and you can’t hold his hand ” Gardner said. “He looked peaceful  the staff were brilliant but not being with him was terrible.” He was living at the home in Bicester because he had severe Alzheimer’s. He had a chest infection five weeks ago and the GP was worried it was coronavirus  but they did not travel to see him because of the lockdown. “I felt guilty. I felt we should be doing the right thing and shouldn’t make the journey. You don’t want to break the rules. Then one of his carers phoned us to tell us to come. We waited a bit but then she phoned again and said she didn’t think he would survive as she’d seen this before. Her own father had died the week before in the room next to my dad.” Gardner said four other residents had died at the home and the number might be higher. She felt her father’s death could have been prevented and was critical of the lack of testing of staff and residents. “It should have been a matter of course for care homes.” she said. “The most vulnerable sector of the population and you decide not to test. That’s bordering on manslaughter  in my view.” As for the urgent drive to Bicester  she said: “I was glad I saw him  as he died the next evening.” Himani Weir now wishes she had broken her mother out of the care home in south-east London where she died of a confirmed case Covid-19 on 16 April. The last weeks were that difficult. For 18 months  Weir had visited Octavia Jayasuriya  84  four times a week as she endured Parkinson’s disease and heart problems. Then came the lockdown and her decline began. “I felt immediately out of touch with my mother ” Weir said. “During the first week we were doing video calls and she was reassuring me that she was OK. But a week or so later I got very concerned when I saw her on a FaceTime video. She looked very unwell.” The care home was not allowing visitors but she went with her daughters and saw her though the window. “She was looking terrible ” she said. “Her eyes were closed and none of the staff who were going in and out were in PPE. I raised my concern about that with the manager and she said that they were not wearing PPE until they saw symptoms with the residents.” A resident had died of confirmed coronavirus in hospital and Weir was increasingly worried. By mid-April  staff were so concerned they called the family for an end-of-life visit. “I could see there were tears in her eyes ” she recalled. “She was sad. She gave me a look and it was a look of unconditional love. If you could hug a person with your eyes  that’s what she did.” Weir was with her mother on the day she died and  while she feels the staff cared for her well  she is frustrated her mother died from the virus. “I felt guilty and I felt confused because the information was patchy. I felt I’d let my mum down. I would have kidnapped her  if I’d known. She was a sitting duck and I told the manager after she died that I wish I’d broken her out. She was trapped there.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2620613e201524fab35840f81f78c4e3bedc9f1/0_328_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07dfe9bfaeb3c80ecaddf6cd696ed1ba https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18db2cb4f398ead80347eebf3a39d2ffc68d1a44/82_196_5545_3327/master/5545.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d250f0a5b5dba0f160a90f5ccf2e4eb9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f9cdfa938e859cdd74cd730f3497b366cccdfd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26a7006e206f1249d0f88af234399929 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3fdd939293cf6167023c810aa00cd570bb7029c/0_457_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45dccf6cea88493ec1d9e1af289db8a4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9/0_0_800_1200/master/800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ddd3585ca5a8d1d00a6bc14ecde072b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be21e4c2a73f2b909baefae41fbc81834394f6d9/0_0_2448_3264/master/2448.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29a560e0473e7de73c1d20829836067e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=90d4fe3fed6cfa9a1f562d931d23e1b8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2COlder+people%2CSocial+care%2CSociety%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/uk-carers-lost-jobs-raising-safety-fears-consider-legal-action-covid-19-care-homes,society, UK carers who lost jobs after raising safety fears consider legal action, Charity warns whistleblowers are being sacked from care homes during Covid-19 crisis, As the care industry struggles to grapple with the unfolding pandemic  Compassion in Care  a charity that runs a helpline for whistleblowers  claims the five carers came forward this month to say they no longer had positions after disclosing safety problems. The health workers are contemplating legal action after contacting regulators and authorities with concerns  the charity has said. There is growing concern about the situation inside the country’s care homes  with the sector feared to be at the centre of crisis. On Wednesday  the government released figures that revealed the coronavirus deaths for both in hospitals and the community  including care homes  for the first time. It added an additional 3 811 deaths for those who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the community since the start of the outbreak  bringing the total number of deaths to more than 26 000. The carers’ dismissals  which were first reported in the Times  relate to confidentiality breaches. Three of the carers were sacked  the charity explained  and the other two would have cases for constructive dismissal. Compassion in Care’s founder  Eileen Chubb  who herself was a care industry whistleblower  told the Guardian the carers were thinking about taking legal action via employment tribunals to challenge their cases. She said she believed more carers would lose their jobs for blowing the whistle as the pandemic continued  adding: “Going back four weeks we had people who were raising concerns about PPE  about staffing levels  about the kind of care and also about Covid-19 patients being placed in the home after hospital. All of those issues were raised and now you’ve got a situation where no action was taken weeks later and staff are beginning to think nobody is listening. And they’re right.” Chubb  who said she was not publicly naming the firms the carers had worked at to protect the whistleblowers’ identities  added: “All of the care homes are staffed on a wing and prayer anyway. Then you have something like this happen and you haven’t got the reserves in staff to cover what is happening because the [owners of the homes] have cut everything to get bigger profits and there’s no reserve. “People have got to breaking point now because there’s no action being taken and they can’t see why that action cannot be taken by the employer. So there’s a massive loss of trust and also a huge amount of anger.” Summarising the carers’ concerns  Chubb said: “The overriding theme is going to work everyday and waiting for your concerns to be addressed breaks you a little more each day. In the end  you have no trust left that any action is going to be taken or any positive change is going to come about. “I suppose because staff feel they’re risking their lives doing this  it’s changed the whole dynamic. Whistleblowers contact us all the time so we know whistleblowing  we live it  we know the kind of issues that are going to come up. But this is a whole new thing  this is a situation where in a short amount of time trust is lost much quicker because of the conditions. It’s concentrated in a way we’ve never seen before.” On 6 April  Compassion in Care released figures showing it had received 87 calls in the two weeks prior from staff raising PPE concerns in social care  including 61 in residential homes  20 from nursing homes and six for home care agencies. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d10a0ddeb660649a96f56d96d4f28f5b60c2e98/0_277_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33e870ffe2c8f7d1bd01ccbbaed82326 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Care+workers%2CSocial+care%2CSociety%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CLaw https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/randomised-coronavirus-test-of-100000-will-determine-end-date-of-uk-lockdown,world, Randomised test of 100 000 to help decide end of UK lockdown, Home testing kits will be sent out next week to clear up ‘Wild West’ of Covid-19 estimates, The tests  next week  will provide a national snapshot of the proportion of those infected with the virus ahead of a planned review of restrictions on 7 May. Prof Ara Darzi  the director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London  which is running the study with the pollster Ipsos Mori  said that – short of a vaccine – testing represented the only way out of the lockdown. “But the testing landscape is like the Wild West with no rules  no standards and widely varying reliability ” he added. “With this ambitious programme  the biggest in England  we aim to establish a viable testing programme on which the government can rely.” The 100 000 people  selected from 315 local authorities across England  will be invited to carry out home tests that will show whether they are currently infected with the coronavirus. The team plans to repeat the exercise in four to six weeks’ time – or at a point when lockdown restrictions are being eased – to capture early signals that any resurgence is occurring. “You need the big numbers to be sure that you find low levels of the virus in the community ” said Prof Graham Cooke  a member of the Imperial College team. In the second part of the programme  a number of different antibody tests will be assessed for their accuracy and ease of use at home. The tests will first be carried out on volunteers from Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust who are known to have had the virus  to establish their accuracy. Three hundred public volunteers will also be given a sample test to self-administer  which requires them to place a fingerprick of blood in a cassette  add a dye and read off the result  to assess how well people are able to perform the tests at home. If the tests are shown to be sufficiently accurate and usable  they will be distributed to larger cohorts  with the potential to roll out the antibody testing to 100 000 people later this year  to provide an indication of the prevalence of Covid-19 immunity. Previously the government had floated the possibility of making antibody tests readily available to the public through Boots and Amazon  and ordered millions of commercial kits. It had to backtrack on this proposal after the best performing of these only picked up antibodies about 70% of the time. However  Cooke said that some of the assessments of the accuracy of these tests may have been overly pessimistic  because lab-stored serum was used  rather than blood samples taken directly from individuals. He added that some of the tests might not be sensitive enough to provide results for individuals  but could still provide a broad picture of what proportion of the population had been infected. James Bethell  a health minister  said: “Understanding more about the current spread of coronavirus and the prevalence of antibodies is a vital part of our ongoing response to this pandemic. This ambitious new testing programme will help us track the rate of the infection now. “And  crucially  it will help identify an antibody test that is accurate and easy to use  and which can give us an indication of how many people have already had the infection. This information will inform the future action we take to manage the spread of the virus  including the development of new tests and treatments.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdcef54cb6a50832b45f253ec8c77c56b20ba036/0_205_5383_3230/master/5383.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d82553cb9357161dada8a3207d7814bf https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CScience%2CNHS%2CSociety%2CImperial+College+London https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/five-already-dead-by-time-uk-reported-first-coronavirus-death,world, Five already dead by time UK reported first coronavirus death, Official data shows first fatality happened three days before government announcement, The figures show that the lethal impact of the outbreak had already been recorded when Boris Johnson joked about shaking hands with hospital staff in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing on 3 March  when no deaths had been officially announced. The first death was not made public until two days later on 5 March  when a woman in her 70s died at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading. But the new figures provided to the Guardian by NHS England show that another patient also died that day  at the Pennine acute hospitals trust in Greater Manchester. It also emerged that the first coronavirus death in the UK occurred on 2 March when a care home patient died  according to details confirmed by Public Health England. This was the first of an additional 3 811 deaths that occurred outside hospitals that were added this week to the the UK’s death toll of those who have tested positive for the virus. It has also emerged that the first three hospital deaths occurred in Nottingham  Essex and Buckinghamshire on 3 March – the day of the first Downing Street briefing. At the briefing Johnson said: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.” Johnson would go on to continue shaking hands with people until at least 9 March  when a fifth victim was publicly confirmed to have died in the UK. The updated NHS England data  shows that 16 people had died by 9 March  including three that day. Earlier this month  NHS England said its revised records showed the first death occurred on 28 February  but it has now clarified that this was a data entry error. A spokeswoman said: “The actual date of that death was 28 March  and the 28 February had been put in by mistake. The records have been updated.” She explained that those collating the daily death toll have to rely on data being accurately recorded by individual hospital trusts. She said: “Data teams are checking in daily with trusts on their deaths. The recorded deaths that we announced every day have generally taken place over the previously three or four days.” The time lag on reporting the deaths has meant the impact of the virus actually hit much earlier than previously acknowledged. By 13 March  the end of the Cheltenham festival when 68 000 people gathered for the Gold Cup  there had been 51 deaths in English hospitals at a time when only 11 deaths in the UK had been announced. On the day the lockdown was imposed on 23 March  the government had announced 336 deaths  but by the end of that day there had actually been 802 deaths in English hospitals alone  including 136 that day. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3318cba088463103f03bb15c7aa9584789d4f12/0_156_3311_1986/master/3311.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4298aafa86e946f31f12957b21f280f1 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CNHS%2CSocial+care%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-will-miss-100000-coronavirus-tests-target-minister-admits,world, UK carries out 81 600 tests as deadline for 100 000 target looms, PM reports rise of 30 000 in daily tally of tests  in pursuit of goal set for end of April, Boris Johnson revealed that there had been a huge jump of 30 000 tests in the previous 24 hours  but it will not be clear whether ministers have met their goal until later on Friday. Earlier  the justice secretary  Robert Buckland  had conceded the government was likely to miss its deadline  as only 52 000 tests had been carried out on Tuesday. “Even if we don’t hit it  we will in the next few days hit that target. We are up to 52 000 being tested  capacity is rising and I think it was right to set an ambitious target. Sometimes if you don’t hit a target on the due date  the direction of travel is the most important thing. And I believe we are going to get there and move beyond it because we need more ” he told Sky News. However  the jump of almost 30 000 more tests in 24 hours suggested the government was potentially in touching distance of meeting the target after all. Johnson said 81 611 tests had been carried out on Wednesday  although only 54 575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90 000. There has been suspicion that the government may try to claim that reaching 100 000 capacity for tests as a victory on Friday  even if the testing goal itself is missed. The number of daily tests may also be inflated by the fact that it includes tests sent out in the post  rather than tests actually completed with results. The deadline was set by Matt Hancock  the health secretary  on 2 April as the government came under pressure over low testing levels. At that point  there was capacity for 12 799 daily tests in England  with just over 10 650 tests carried out. The total as of 9am on Wednesday was 52 429 tests with capacity to do 73 000  but only 33 000 individuals were tested because of multiple retests. Ministers will not know until Friday how many tests were carried out on 30 April  but the number is likely to jump substantially because the criteria for those eligible for testing was widened this week to include over-65s with symptoms  those who work outside the home with symptoms  and all care home residents and carers  whether or not they have symptoms. Buckland said he was frustrated by the likely failure to hit the target but encouraged that the rate of increase in testing had expanded so rapidly. Earlier  hospital leaders launched a strident attack on the government’s testing strategy  regardless of the target. Saffron Cordery  the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers  which represents foundation trusts in England  dismissed the 100 000 target as a “red herring” that distracted from the lack of a coherent overall strategy. NHS Providers said in a report on Wednesday: “NHS trust leaders believe they have done all they can to support the national testing effort so far but are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clarity on how the testing regime will be developed for this next phase. “At the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups  with no visibility on any longer term strategy  and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83565fea77c4eb9107418359dbd125e40a195/845_1327_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7552e116e5d1db85120e82637abe2a7d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CRobert+Buckland%2CPolitics%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/condom-sales-down-as-lockdown-limits-sex-lives-says-durex-makers,society, Condom sales down as lockdown limits sex lives  says Durex maker, Physical distancing rules to limit coronavirus spread taking toll on ‘number of intimate occasions’, Laxman Narasimhan  the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser  the British household goods company that bought Durex in 2010  said condom sales had dropped as people are unable to have as much sex because of the strict physical distancing and lockdown rules. Narasimhan said the amount of sex people were having had “gone down a lot in Italy”  and had also fallen in the UK and elsewhere as people stopped having casual hook-ups. Meeting up with people who do not live in the same household is against lockdown rules. “What you see is this virus is having a toll on the number of intimate occasions in the UK ” he said. Narasimhan added that young people in the UK were having “significantly” less sex than before the lockdown started on 23 March. He said increased anxiety had also led to less sex between established couples. On the first day of the UK lockdown  the government told people in new relationships they had to decide immediately whether to take their partnership to the next level and move in together or quarantine themselves separately. Jenny Harries  the deputy chief medical officer  said: “If the two halves of a couple are currently in separate households  ideally they should stay in those households. Harries said at the first daily Downing Street media briefing on 24 March: “The alternative might be that  for quite a significant period going forwards  they should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.” She added: “So perhaps  test really carefully your strength of feeling  stay with the household  either together or apart  but keep it that way while we go forward  because otherwise we will not all be working towards achieving our outcome.” Matt Hancock  the health secretary  added: “There you go. Make your choice and stick with it.” Reckitt Benckiser said it expected demand for condoms to recover when the lockdown ends  and said its condom factories would not scale back production. Narasimhan added that in China  the slowdown in sex during its lockdown had recovered and condom demand was back at the same levels as before the crisis. There have been concerns of a global condom shortage because strict lockdown rules in Malaysia  one of world’s top rubber producers and a major source of condoms  had made it difficult for condom factories to operate. Karex  the world’s largest condom producer which makes one in five of all condoms  has warned of a global condom shortage after closing three of its factories. The firm said it expects to produce 200m fewer condoms than usual from mid-March to mid-April. Goh Miah Kiat  Karex’s chief executive  told AFP earlier this month: “The world will definitely see a condom shortage.” “It’s challenging  but we are trying our best right now to do whatever we can. It is definitely a major concern – a condom is an essential medical device ” he said. Kiat added that the lack of supply could lead to serious societal and disease problems in developing countries as a large proportion of its condoms are supplied to governments and for distribution by aid programmes. The United Nations has warned that a lack of condoms could lead to “devastating” health and social problems across the world. “A shortage of condoms  or any contraceptive  could lead to an increase in unintended pregnancies  with potentially devastating health and social consequences for adolescent girls  women and their partners and families ” a spokesperson said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84c436634521868403767c71d82565bd39c9ce60/0_39_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03838141ce175bdb678b7d0a3b472dd9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Reckitt+Benckiser%2CSexual+health%2CSex%2CBusiness%2CHealthcare+industry%2CHealth%2CLife+and+style%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CItaly https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/itv-considers-filming-love-island-in-cornwall-or-cancelling-series,media, ITV considers filming Love Island in Cornwall or cancelling series, Reality show has already been delayed  while soaps could soon run out of episodes, The reality show  which has been vital to ITV’s financial performance in recent years  has already been delayed from its traditional June start date owing to the coronavirus pandemic. ITV’s director of television  Kevin Lygo  said the production team had looked at filming Love Island in Cornwall later in the summer but had concerns that “making it in the UK would not be the same show”. He told a virtual session of the Edinburgh television festival that a final decision on whether to cancel the programme  which employs around 200 staff  would be made in the coming weeks. Lygo also suggested Love Island may not fit the national mood. “What signal might it be sending out if we’re doing a show where everyone is crammed together  slavering over each other  while the rest of world has been told not to go near anyone in the park? “We’re approaching the moment of ‘is it feasible?’  ‘will Mallorca open its doors to hundreds of production people?’  ‘will there have to be quarantine?’. We have to factor all that in. We’ll make a decision soon.” Lygo also said soap operas  which have already been broadcasting on a reduced schedule  would soon fall off air unless filming could resume. Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May and Coronation Street in June. He said Emmerdale had prepared a number of episodes that were “just two people talking”  which could theoretically be filmed in line with physical distancing rules if required. He said the channel was learning from its forthcoming Isolation Stories strand of 15-minute dramas  in which actors and their families have been filmed in their houses with directors sat outside. Lygo said a major issue was that insurers were refusing to cover the cost of production being halted if a cast or crew member catches coronavirus. “This summer  trust me  there’s going to be a lot of repeats on ” he said. Hit shows such as Britain’s Got Talent may also be axed owing to physical distancing rules  although the surprise hit The Masked Singer will film in the autumn even if an audience cannot be present. Lygo said he was concerned that although TV audiences had shot up  the increase was mainly for daytime shows and news programmes rather than peak-time programming. “You can see people’s habits are changing because they are discovering Netflix  Amazon  Disney+ and storing things up.” Lygo was asked what audiences would be seeing on TV in early 2021  given television production has ground to a halt in recent months. He replied: “They will be watching a repeat of Midsomer Murders  I can tell you that now in great confidence.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6307331898f2b5b4842cecc959fc1edf1337f1f3/198_0_3462_2080/master/3462.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=62f39a8720edbdf407ca397a81e6d3c9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=ITV+channel%2CLove+Island%2CCoronation+Street%2CEmmerdale%2CReality+TV%2CSoap+opera%2CITV+plc%2CITV%2CTelevision+industry%2CTelevision%2CMedia%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites,world, British BAME Covid-19 death rate 'more than twice that of whites', IFS report says number of UK deaths looks disproportionate in most ethnic minority groups, The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100 000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However  unlike previous analysis  the IFS research  published on Friday  strips out the role of age  gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Ross Warwick  a research economist at IFS and co-author of the report said: “When you account for the fact that most minority groups are relatively young overall  the number of deaths looks disproportionate in most ethnic minority groups. There is unlikely to be a single explanation here and different factors may be more important for different groups. For instance  while black Africans are particularly likely to be employed in key worker roles which might put them at risk  older Bangladeshis appear vulnerable on the basis of underlying health conditions.” Accounting for differences in age  sex and geography  the IFS found deaths of British black Africans background to be 3.5 times those of the white British population and British Pakistani deaths to be 2.7 times as high. Examining the possible reasons  it says that a third of all working-age Black Africans are employed in key worker roles  50% more than the share of the White British population. Additionally it says Pakistani  Indian and Black African men are respectively 90%  150% and 310% more likely to work in healthcare than white British men. Two-thirds of British Bangladeshi men over the age of 60 have a long-term health condition that would put them at particular risk from infection  while underlying health conditions are also especially prevalent among older people of a Pakistani or black Caribbean background  according to the report. Concerns have been growing about the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on black  Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people since figures published earlier this month showed that 35% of almost 2 000 Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in England  Wales and Northern Ireland were non-white  compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales  according to the 2011 census. Fears were fuelled by the fact that the first 10 doctors with the virus reported to have died were also BAME. After the head of the British Medical Association told the Guardian an inquiry was necessary to get to the bottom of the disparities  the government obliged a week later  although it has yet to reveal the terms of reference or timescale. Further statistics showing up disparities have since come to light. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally  63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian  according to the Health Service Journal. While cultural practices and genetics have been mooted as possible explanations for the disparities  higher levels of social deprivation have also been mooted as a cause and the IFS warns that some ethnic groups look more likely than others to suffer economically from the lockdown. Professor Lucinda Platt  from LSE and report co-author said: “There are striking differences in economic vulnerability between ethnic groups. Bangladeshi men are four times as likely as White British men to have jobs in shutdown industries  with Pakistani men nearly three times as likely; and household savings are lower than average among Black Africans  Black Caribbeans and Bangladeshis. By contrast Indians and the largely foreign-born Other White group do not seem to be facing disproportionate economic risks.” Dr Zubaida Haque  deputy director of the Runnymede Trust  praised the report and said it was important it recognised different ethnic groups have different socio-economic factors affecting them. “It is bringing into sharp relief the health and economic inequalities among ethnic minorities  which Runnymede trust have been saying is absolutely critical to understanding why some ethnic minority groups are bearing the brunt of Covid-19 ” she said. “But I think we need to go a step further and say it’s not enough to just observe and recognise that. The government needs to think about what more it can do  right now  on top of the review it commissioned  to buffer the health and economic vulnerabilities that ethnic minorities are much more exposed to.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb06dd987babc640ed2911a4d81b13724bda5bac/74_0_3326_1996/master/3326.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33f759046505fd97e30c33bc08be29e7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CRace%2CInequality%2CPopulation%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/30/from-meltdown-to-lockdown-the-theatre-festival-coming-to-a-radio-near-you,stage, From Meltdown to Lockdown: theatre festival coming to a radio near you, Four stage shows will be performed by actors using sterilised studio kit at home, The Lockdown theatre festival  which will air on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4  is the brainchild of the actor Bertie Carvel. Four productions will be broadcast during the launch weekend of 13 June and 14 June as part of the BBC culture in quarantine initiative. Speaking to the Guardian  Carvel – best known for his TV role as a cheating husband in Doctor Foster - said British theatre was facing an existential threat from Covid-19  but added that with enough government support it could be reshaped to become more diverse and inclusive once the lockdown comes to an end. “This isn’t the usual complaint about underfunding of the arts ” he said. “This national treasure stretching back to William Shakespeare is under threat. We need a really grown-up conversation and money from the exchequer to pull together some serious industrial investment on a strategic level so we can rebuild. “There’s an opportunity for regrowth and for us to rebuild our cultural industries with better leadership and more diversity  but let’s be really clear all of those arts organisations that were already struggling are in danger of being lost.” Carvel  who has won two Olivier awards and one Tony  said the UK government needed to follow the lead of Germany and deliver a comprehensive support package for the arts  otherwise many of the country’s theatres would not be able to reopen after the lockdown measures were lifted. Germany announced a federal aid package worth €50bn (£43bn) for freelancers and small businesses  with Berlin distributing €5 000 payments to individual freelancers  including artists. “We look across with envy at Germany  where they’ve announced a huge support package for the arts coming out of this crisis ” he said. “If we don’t think big about how we’re going to build back better then we’re not going to have an arts and culture scene  or at least it’s not going to be anything like we have become used to.” Four productions will be broadcast during the festival’s launch weekend as part of BBC Arts’ initiative. Mike Bartlett’s Love Love Love and Winsome Pinnock’s Rockets and Blue Lights will air on Radio 3  while Radio 4 will broadcast Josh Azouz’s The Mikvah Project and Shoe Lady by EV Crowe. All four productions were forced to close early. The BBC’s technical team delivered the home studio equipment to each actor  sterilising them before and after use at their homes across the country. Some practical difficulties beyond those usually encountered during a stage production arose  including one recording being forced to pause at 1pm because of a cannon firing at Edinburgh castle  near a performer’s home. Vicky Featherstone  whose production of Shoe Lady closed early at the Royal Court theatre  London  said: “This festival allows more people to hear the work and begins to create a sense of the breadth  passion  imagination and talent of this country’s incredible range of theatre-makers.” Carvel’s fears for the theatre scene echoed those of the playwright James Graham  who worked with Carvel on his play Ink and called for an “aggressive government bailout”  warning that without one the industry would only become more elitist after the Covid-19 crisis ends. The artistic director of the National Theatre  Rufus Norris  recently said that some theatres had only days before they may go out of business  and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebb8a454c557d2430f6d10a4f12297476814019/0_360_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=434bc7094288bb2956000555a38c0682 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Theatre%2CStage%2CCulture%2CRadio+3%2CRadio+4%2CBBC%2CRadio+industry https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

Among his most successful hits were Peace Train  Morning Has Broken  Father and Son  and Wild World. His conversion to Islam came after he almost died from tuberculosis in 1969 and in a near-drowning in the sea in California in 1976. After a long period reflecting on spirituality and faith  he gave up his music career  auctioned all his guitars for charity and devoted himself to running Islamic schools for children. In 2006 he released a new album under the name of Yusuf  and his most recent album  A Laughing Apple  appeared in 2017 under the name Yusuf/Cat Stevens. In the BBC reflections  he reads from the Qur’an and other holy texts and performs his own songs. In the first 10-minute reflection  to be broadcast on Friday  he says: “Humans  as far as we know  are the only earthly creatures who have to live with the knowledge of their own mortality. Now  for anyone with a mind  it’s hard not to question the reason for this  or to contemplate what might be beyond the final wall we must all climb one day.” In the second talk  he promises to discuss “how near-death came to wake me up and begin my journey in search of meaning”. The BBC is broadcasting a series of reflections and talks during Ramadan at 5.50am on Fridays on 14 local radio stations  which are also available on BBC Sounds. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22227bce1c5ae1afb242b1c7b02cfc8af2a4c4c8/0_139_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b08748e67af1cf2f14cb13cc19ba516a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ramadan%2CIslam%2CRadio%2CFolk+music%2CMusic%2CBBC%2CUK+news%2CReligion%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture%2CMedia https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

He said his grandfather loved betting on the horses and entertaining those around him with stories. “So  when I woke up to a call from my dad last night to say that ‘your grandad has committed suicide’  it came as a huge shock and has hit the family like a tonne of bricks and will be hard to understand for us all.” Ward grew up in Coventry but spent much of his life in south Birmingham with his wife of 60 years  Valerie Ward. He had worked at Jaguar Land Rover in Castle Bromwich  a village in the West Midlands. The family confirmed to the Guardian that Ward had died at his Kings Norton home on Saturday. “If you are reading this  I ask you all today  to just pick up the phone to your parents  grandparents  friends or anyone vulnerable to check up on them and ask if they are OK and are coping. I never got the chance to speak to him as I thought he would be OK and would see him on the other side ” Parnaby said. Parnaby has set up a fundraising page for the charity Mind in memory of Ward  which has collected nearly £2 000. He hoped the funds would help raise awareness about mental health issues  particularly during the current crisis. “If you could kindly donate anything  whether it’s 5p or £50 it would mean the world to us. This great charity help people with any sort of mental health issues. The coronavirus pandemic is having a huge impact on our mental health ” he wrote. Earlier this month  Prof Rory O’Connor  an expert leading the UK’s assessment of the coronavirus outbreak’s psychological impact  said people who feel trapped and lonely during the coronavirus lockdown must be swiftly identified and given the help they need. Police have recorded early signs of an increase in suicides and attempted suicides during lockdown. • In the UK and Ireland  Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/uk-food-banks-face-record-demand-in-coronavirus-crisis,society, UK food banks face record demand in coronavirus crisis, Charities call for urgent boost to benefits  especially for families with children, The Trussell Trust  the UK’s biggest food bank network  said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March  when it issued 50 000 food parcels in the space of a week  almost double its usual volume. A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan)  which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March – 17 times higher than the same period a year ago. Labour called on the government to take urgent action through the benefits system to help families who had fallen into hardship. Jonathan Reynolds  the shadow work and pensions secretary  said: “Food banks are doing an incredible job in tough circumstances with unprecedented demand  but the government should be ensuring that people have the resources they need to stop their families going hungry.” Food bank charities warned that the current high levels of demand for food parcels were unsustainable and called for new income support measures. “We need emergency measures to ensure people can makes ends meet during this crisis. We have the power to come together as a country and make sure support is there to stop any of us being swept into poverty during this emergency ” said the Trussell Trust’s chief executive  Emma Revie. She said government measures to support struggling families  such as the job retention scheme and a £20-a-week increase to universal credit  were welcome but not enough to prevent increasing numbers of people falling into hardship. The trust called for a boost to benefit payments for families with children  and for the lifting of policies that limited the amount of benefit support families were entitled to  such as the two-child policy and the benefit cap. Food banks across the UK – already working at maximum capacity – have struggled with food stocks as Covid-19 hit  with five Trussell Trust food banks and a handful of Ifan food banks forced to close. Staff numbers also plummeted as the predominantly older volunteer workforce self-isolated. The Trussell Trust said overall food levels have stabilised  after help from major supermarkets. Stocks remain depleted  however  and there is concern that some volunteer teams may be close to burnout  and may face disruption again if lockdown is relaxed and volunteers return to their full-time jobs. The dramatic recent increase in food bank reliance  which comes after years of gradually rising food bank use  were caused by people’s income dropping – often because they had lost their job – or because their benefit payments failed to keep up with the cost of living  the trust said. Its figures  based on returns from 70% of the network’s 432 members  show demand starting to creep up in early March before exploding later in the month. The numbers of households with children helped by its food banks increased by 122%. There are as yet no April figures though the trust said food banks have been “very busy”. Ifan’s figures  based on returns from 85 of its 252 members  found that a third saw increases of more than 100% in food parcel distribution between February and March compared with the same period last year. Sabine Goodwin  Ifan’s coordinator  said: “The solution is not in trying to distribute more food parcels but in providing sufficient income to the huge numbers of people impacted by this crisis and the poverty that preceded it.” A government spokesman said: “We’re committed to supporting all those affected by Covid-19 through these unprecedented times and we’ve implemented an enormous package of measures to do so  including income protection schemes and mortgage holidays. “For those in most need  we’ve injected more than £6.5bn into the welfare system  including an increase to universal credit of up to £1 040 a year. No one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23f2b2bfbec5fa38ab5e49b4bb7fff4db6afb3a/0_175_5193_3114/master/5193.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9e46ca77616824fcba2a8869fda4d512 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Food+banks%2CPoverty%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSocial+exclusion%2CSociety%2CCharities%2CBenefits%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/life-with-a-beijing-covid-19-quarantine-handler-coronavirus,world, Ms Du  door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler, China’s coronavirus measures are often seen as tough and effective - but how well do they really work?, She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis  asking me to “please cooperate” with the rules. If I open my door  equipped with a sensor  to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery  she immediately calls and tells me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan  I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station  perhaps checking the spelling of my name  someone from the health department asking about my travel history  or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to “spit wherever you please”. The calls and questions  politely made  are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last. In the last few weeks  I find that my friends and family elsewhere have started to look at China and its ability to enforce coronavirus measures with a mixture of awe and envy. Many also find it disconcerting. In addition to an army of local residents like Du  the tools of China’s surveillance state help track residents who may pose a health risk. What strikes me  however  is how confused and sometimes absurd the enforcement of these measures can be. To the outside world  China’s lockdowns and strict quarantine requirements are evidence of its vast state power and draconian tendencies. But on the ground  the implementation is often bureaucratic and bumbling and the measures more tedious and overbearing than intimidating. A week into my quarantine  I was told to start filling in a daily sheet on whether or not I have experienced a cough  sore throat  fatigue  runny nose  aches  diarrhoea or vomiting that day - ticking yes or no for each symptom. A day later  Du said I would also need to submit my temperature five times a day - every three hours from 9am to 9pm. I negotiated the check-ins down to the original twice a day. There are loopholes and inconsistencies. A friend in what is called “centralised quarantine” at a designated hotel  mainly for those who have come from overseas  has snuck out several times  wandering the halls and going to the building’s roof. Other apartment compounds have asked returning residents to simply promise not to go out. In some cases  the processes appear to be well-planned but little effort has been made to communicate to people what will happen. In March  my husband was put into centralised quarantine and delivered to a hotel with nothing more than a list of instructions in Chinese on how to report his temperature and when he could open his windows. There were no details about how he would get meals or water. “For any questions  contact the work group ” it said  without listing any contact information. Both residents and the people in charge of their quarantines are at the mercy of vague policies  announced with little warning. In one of our more personal exchanges  Du said my quarantine would be extended by seven extra days. She listened patiently while I had a minor meltdown  demanding to know how they could arbitrarily lock me at home for three weeks. “I understand how you feel  and a lot of people feel the way you do ” she said  promising she would take it up with her superiors. After 14 days of working from home  doing workout videos and cooking elaborate meals for myself  I finally got a chance to see Du. She was younger than I expected  dressed in a face mask  gloves and a red armband identifying herself as a community volunteer. She was with two medics in full hazmat suits who had come to test whether or not I have the virus. As I squatted down in front of my door so a medic could swab my throat  Du filmed the exchange on her mobile phone. Later that day  Beijing officials announced the city was downgrading its emergency response level. I sent Du and others several messages highlighting the part of the press conference that seemed to mean I was no longer subject to an extra week of quarantine. No one responded except to say they had not received any directive yet. The next morning  a man came to take the sensor off my door. As he tugged at the device and scraped at the adhesive  I asked whether or not I could leave. “I don’t know ” he said. “You’ll have to ask someone else.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/04/12/Lily_Kuo,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3537677c9cf44791c646ae8560d8b31 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea4f7cdf92398cfa865cedb00f70e17061dfef1/0_96_8033_4821/master/8033.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f04e6ac1eaa9c7ff94dbbcdc7a166493 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee124305bc9321a374970c14476ab0ba8cd95efe/0_431_6470_3882/master/6470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76c8e53cd84bbbaf27e88c515935669d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b52f24e2f68e9d038db86e202646a0180f70b692/2_0_2995_1798/master/2995.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ec256666c291d0d6fc7d8993a0b2244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=China%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/danes-and-czechs-say-easing-lockdowns-has-produced-no-covid-19-surge,world, Danes and Czechs say easing lockdowns has produced no Covid-19 surge, Encouraging signs from EU states who acted early  as South Korea reports no new cases, As EU governments grappled with the complex and conflicting imperatives of easing the lockdowns crippling their economies while avoiding a disastrous second wave of infections  meanwhile  South Korea reported no new cases for the first time. Of the 44 European countries to have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the virus  21 had started easing some of them and a further 11 were planning to do so soon  said Hans Kluge  regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe. Kluge warned that all governments must remain extremely circumspect. “As I have said before  this virus is unforgiving ” he said. “We must remain vigilant  persevere and be patient – and ready to ramp up measures again as and when needed.” There was  though  encouraging news from the Czech Republic and Denmark  where phased exits from strict lockdowns implemented early in the pandemic are under way. In Denmark  daycare facilities and schools began reopening two weeks ago  followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. “There are no signs at all that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection ” said Christian Wejse  a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. “At least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern  but I can’t see that at all.” The Czech health minister  Adam Vojt?ch  said the country’s number of new cases had been below 100 for the past eight consecutive days and also reported that a staggered reopening of shops and services had not so far led to a surge in infections. “So far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations ” Vojt?ch said. “We will proceed with caution  gradually in the upcoming waves  and I believe we are on a good path.” Proceeding cautiously  Germany on Thursday said places of worship  museums  gardens  zoos  playgrounds and monuments could reopen over the coming days after the chancellor  Angela Merkel  met the heads of the 16 German states. But the federal government and state leaders postponed decisions on whether to reopen all schools and kindergartens and said physical distancing rules would stay in place at least until 10 May  with no further relaxations to be decided before 6 May. Merkel said reopening cafes and restaurants at this stage would be problematic because of the difficulty of checking whether “people around one table are from one family  or from different households”. She said Germany’s goal currently remained to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly. “We don’t have any medication  we don’t have any vaccine against the virus and ... therefore  the goal will always be to slow down the virus ” Merkel said  adding that Germany had so far been “successful in achieving this goal”. Germany began easing its lockdown last week  when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing  but Merkel and government advisers have expressed serious concerns about the dangers of going to far  too fast  with the risk of the infection rate stating to rise again. In Spain  where the daily death toll fell to its lowest in six weeks on Thursday  the health minister announced time slots for specific outdoor activities  in an effort to avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March. Salvador Illa said that except in smaller towns with fewer than 5 000 inhabitants  people would be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and 8pm until 11pm  while people who needed carers or were over 70 could be out from 10am to midday and from 7pm until 8pm. Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. “We need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice ” Illa said. “We got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There’s no other way.” France categorised each of its 95 départements as either red  amber or green according to its risk level  with much of the north and east of the country – including Paris – red  and much of the west and south-west green. Based on infection rate and intensive care bed capacity  the designation will be updated daily until 7 May  when a decision will be made on how fast each will be able to come out of lockdown on 11 May. The country’s environment minister  Élisabeth Borne  said the government will contribute €50 per person towards bicycle repairs from 11 May  as part of a package of measures to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads. Under pressure from some regional politicians to lift Europe’s longest lockdown sooner  Italy’s prime minister also said the country’s gradual return to normality must be carefully coordinated and based strictly on scientific advice  if it did not want to see a surge in infections. “I’ll say this clearly  at the risk of appearing unpopular ” Giuseppe Conte told parliament on Thursday. “The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... We are still in this pandemic.” The economic devastation wrought by Covid-19 on the continent  however  is already apparent. After Germany on Wednesday said it faced its worst recession since 1949  France  Italy and Spain revealed equally dire figures on Thursday. France and Italy officially fell into recession following historic first-quarter economic declines  while Spain warned of an annual contraction “unprecedented in modern history”. The European Central Bank head  Christine Lagarde  said the crisis threatened “an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peacetime”. South Korea  meanwhile  once one of the hardest-hit countries in a pandemic that has so far infected more than 3.2 million people worldwide and killed nearly 230 000  reported no new cases for the first time since the disease was detected there  boosting hopes of an eventual return to normality. An aggressive test-and-trace strategy and widespread social distancing had allowed the country to bring the spread of the virus under control  President Moon Jae-in said. “This is the strength of South Korea and its people ” he declared on Thursday. Elsewhere  the virus continued to advance. Cases in Russia surged past 100 000 on Thursday as the country recorded its largest daily increase. The country is now the centre of the outbreak in Europe  but a relatively low death total of 1 073 prompted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to say it had avoided a catastrophic “Italian scenario”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d261f3bf566a508cc7d2927251a7b3d87d63557/0_182_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e6aa81f3da2b8400a5d0793021226704 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a7f65c3576b72b12bd856dba5c20884ca26ea3/0_62_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=948a885c3314d5e62f75323f152ece24 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDenmark%2CCzech+Republic%2CSouth+Korea%2CWorld+news%2CEurope https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/brazil-manaus-coronavirus-mass-graves,world, 'Utter disaster': Manaus fills mass graves as Covid-19 hits the Amazon, Emergency measures pile pain on to mourning families as coronavirus tears through the ill-prepared jungle-flanked cityby Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro and Fabiano Maisonnave in Manaus, On Sunday 140 bodies were laid to rest in Manaus  the jungle-flanked capital of Amazonas state. On Saturday  98. Normally the figure would be closer to 30 – but these are no longer normal times. “It’s madness – just madness ” said Gilson de Freitas  a 30-year-old maintenance man whose mother  Rosemeire Rodrigues Silva  was one of 136 people buried there last Tuesday as local morticians set yet another grim daily record. Freitas – who believes his mother contracted Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital following a stroke – recalled watching in despair as her remains were lowered into a muddy trench alongside perhaps 20 other coffins. “They were just dumped there like dogs ” he said. “What are our lives worth now? Nothing.” The city’s mayor  Arthur Virgílio  pleaded for urgent international help. “We aren’t in a state of emergency – we’re well beyond that. We are in a state of utter disaster … like a country that is at war – and has lost ” he said. “It’s tragic surrealism ... I can’t stop thinking about Gabriel García Márquez when I think about the situation Manaus is facing.” The coronavirus appears to have reached this isolated  riverside metropolis of more than 2 million people on 11 March  imported by a 49-year-old woman who had flown in from London. Six weeks later it is taking a terrible toll  with gravediggers so overworked that two men were this week forced to bury their own father. “Manaus is in a race against time to avoid becoming the Brazilian version of Guayaquil ” one local newspaper  A Crítica  warned last week in reference to the Ecuadorian city where bodies have been left rotting in the streets and thousands are feared to have died. With more than 100 people dying each day and Manaus’s overwhelmed authorities performing nighttime burials  many fear it is already too late. City officials say they expect to bury up to 4 500 people in the next month alone. Funeral homes have warned they will run out of wooden coffins by this weekend. In Parque Tarumã – Manaus’s biggest cemetery – excavators have carved out mass graves called “trincheiras” – trenches – in which the dead were being stacked in three-high piles until a revolt from mourning families saw the practice halted. “It’s chaos in there ” said Freitas  whose 58-year-old mother was consigned to the trenches last week. “She spent her whole life working … she paid all of her taxes. She deserved more. We all do.” Edmar Barros  a local photographer who has been documenting the burials  said he had never seen anything similar. “It’s absurd what is happening here ” he said. “It’s a situation of just devastating sadness.” Emergency and health services in Manaus are also buckling under the strain  with ambulances roaming for up to three hours in search of hospitals with space to admit the patients they have collected. Gruesome video footage has emerged from hospitals showing corridors lined with corpses shrouded in body bags and sheets. Another video shows an unconscious patient with his head wrapped inside a ventilator hood improvised from a large plastic bag. “There’s a shortage of mechanical ventilators  of oxygen  of staff  of stretchers. Everything is lacking ” said Dr Domício Magalhães Filho  the technical director of the ambulance service  Samu. Experts and officials say multiple factors explain the intensity of the catastrophe affecting the Amazon region’s biggest city. One is that the coronavirus epidemic has struck at the tail end of the rainy season  when respiratory illnesses are rife and hospitals already stretched. Another is that Manaus’s chronically underfunded health service was poorly equipped and understaffed even before medical workers began contracting Covid-19 themselves. But many also blame corruption and the government’s failure to effectively implement containment measures once Covid-19 was detected. Only on 23 March – 10 days after the first case was confirmed – did the state governor declare a state of emergency  ordering all non-essential businesses to close. “We took too long to ask people to stay at home ” said Leonardo Steiner  the archbishop of Manaus  which is a four-hour flight north of São Paulo. Even now  with the death toll soaring  social distancing is being flouted in some areas on the city’s outskirts  with huge queues outside banks and locals refusing to wear masks or remain at home. “Part of the city seems like it couldn’t care less – it’s as if nothing is happening ” said Barros  the photographer. The mayor admitted he had failed to keep people indoors but said Brazil’s president  Jair Bolsonaro  should shoulder much of the blame for deliberately undermining such measures. “We don’t have hurricanes here. We don’t have tsunamis. Here the tsunami was having disregarded … social isolation.” “It saddens me to know these lives could have been saved and weren’t saved  in part because Brazil’s main leader … said it was OK to go out ” Virgílio added. Marcia Castro  a Harvard University demographer who specialises in public health in the Brazilian Amazon  said it was unrealistic to expect people to follow health ministry advice when 43% of residents didn’t even have access to water to wash their hands. “What this pandemic is doing is throwing wide open the inequalities that have existed for so long ” said Castro  whose studies suggest Manaus’s health system will collapse further in the coming days. Of the 5 000-plus Covid deaths officially confirmed in Brazil only 274 have been recorded in Manaus. But the recent surge in burials leaves no doubt the real total is far higher. Twenty-four hours after Rosemeire Silva’s interment  another local woman  53-year-old Amália Brandão Ribeiro  was rushed unconscious to hospital suffering Covid symptoms – in the front seat of an Uber taxi  since no ambulances were available. Ribeiro’s frenzied arrival was caught on camera – with weeping relatives pleading for help before her lifeless body was eventually hauled inside by staff. “They never even brought a trolley ” said Paula Ribeiro  her daughter. Ribeiro was declared dead soon after  with the cause listed as “unknown”. But it was two days before her children could bury her at the Parque Tarumã – one of 128 funerals that day. The confusion was such that officials initially released a man’s corpse to her family before the mistake was realized. Freitas said he knew little of the ailment that had robbed him of his mother. “It comes from China  doesn’t it?” he said vaguely on Tuesday as President Bolsonaro sparked outrage by shrugging his shoulders at the country’s dead. “All of us are afraid because we don’t know what tomorrow might bring ” Freitas said. “Today we’re alive. Tomorrow we just don’t know.” Additional reporting by Daylla Kobosque , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd5ea50e60491a4dfca01158bddf140a51f1e1f/0_314_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1104139cea02ea36a7052f1bb25c2ef6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ecf91eaa0756068dd5965075afe7655be13520/0_0_2490_1704/master/2490.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f6cc416af0a5e63dc49048f855cbacd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdcdb1ea7439abb6fee539d9ecabd9d2d8ef42d6/0_0_2462_3500/master/2462.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=08d802a21b772126cc5f359768a10907 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2430216210c72e62fa42357cd40066e71870674/0_58_3073_1845/master/3073.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04d7eb17f7ac4fef7f3e3125b86333c9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5d82f6c7871d25f39ee79807b15a4f00e25313f/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a479c9c072cc3a151503b7442ac02dea https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brazil%2CWorld+news%2CAmericas%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/brazil-rio-coronavirus-great-hardship-bolsonaro,world, Bolsonaro faces calls to change tack on Covid-19 as Rio heads for ‘great hardship’, Rio’s health secretary said intensification of containment measures was only way to avoid surge in deaths and social turmoil, Jair Bolsonaro has sabotaged efforts to impose effective social distancing measures by flouting his own health ministry’s recommendations  sacking his health minister and attacking Covid-19 “hysteria”. Asked about the rising death toll this week  the far-right populist sparked outrage by declaring: “So what?” But on Thursday Edmar Santos  the health secretary of Rio  Brazil’s third most populous state  said an intensification of containment measures – perhaps including some form of China-style lockdown – was the only way to avoid a dramatic surge in fatalities and social turmoil. “We are going to live through moments of great national hardship  the likes of which we’ve never experienced before ” Santos told the television network Globo. “We aren’t a country that has lived through major wars like countries in Europe. But we’ve all lost loved ones at some point. We’re going to experience big emotional problems  social problems in the coming days and  unfortunately  we’re going to see a big rise in the number of deaths.” According to official figures Covid-19 has so far claimed 5 466 lives in Brazil – 794 of them in Rio and 2 247 in neighbouring São Paulo. Santos said that if current trends continued about 1 800 people would die in Rio during May – although the number would “undoubtedly be higher” if authorities failed to slow the rate of transmission. But the secretary – who was himself diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier this month – admitted underreporting meant official figures did not capture the scale of the crisis. He believed Rio – which has a population of 17 million - actually had about 140 000 cases – more than 15 times the official number of under 9 000. A study published in the O Globo newspaper suggested the national figures were being similarly underestimated  with more than 1.2m likely infections  compared with the official figure of under 74 000. That would mean Brazil had more cases than the United States  so far the country worst hit by the pandemic  which has about 1 million. “The truth is this: if we don’t flatten the curve we will face chaos in May [and] a second round of chaos in June ” Santos warned  pointing to Italy  which suffered nearly 1 000 deaths on its most deadly day  in late March. In another interview Rio’s health chief said: “What we expect for the next three to four weeks is that Rio de Janeiro and Brazil will experience the same kind of collapse that Italy  Spain and the United States have seen.” The warnings came amid growing signs that efforts to keep Brazilians at home were faltering and with Brazil’s president facing mounting pressure to change his anti-scientific stance towards the pandemic. Flávio Dino  the leftist governor of Maranhão state  urged Bolsonaro to make an immediate address to the nation instructing citizens to remain at home. “Today we are at the cliff edge  on the cusp of total collapse which we need to avoid – and Bolsonaro is the main person responsible for avoiding this situation ” Dino told the news website UOL. Sérgio Moro  the popular justice minister who abandoned Bolsonaro’s government last week  tweeted: “Unfortunately  the number of coronavirus victims in Brazil is rising sharply. It is unclear how the pandemic will evolve. Take care!” The mayor of the crisis-stricken city of Manaus – where an average of 100 burials are being conducted each day – urged fellow mayors and governors to do what he admitted he had failed to do – convince people to stay at home. “What I can say to them is to insist on social isolation … We have to achieve this and reach a percentage [of isolation] that causes the curve to fall ” Arthur Virgílio told the Guardian. Virgílio accused Bolsonaro of offering Brazil’s 211 million citizens a false and dangerous choice between “freedom” and “the prison” of social isolation. “He is offering freedom  but it is a false freedom that could represent a kind of genocide … It’s obvious that this is not going to end well ” Virgílio said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9813ce1e5c45f3242b01f7071f2db6b6ddb2de2/0_94_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4af6d2618df15955ba2afbc7389dd49 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+de+Janeiro%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/no-end-in-sight-100000-crew-on-cruise-ships-stranded-at-sea-coronavirus,environment, Revealed: 100 000 crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis, Guardian investigation finds workers stranded on at least 50 ships with Covid-19 outbreaks  limited medical equipment  some without pay  and no end in sight, Around the world  more than 100 000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships  at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections  a Guardian investigation has found. They are shut out of ports and banned from air travel that would allow them to return to their homes. Many of these crew are quarantined in tiny cabins  and some have had their pay cut off. They have in effect become a nation of floating castaways  marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to Dubai port. Many of the crew have only minimal communication with the outside world  making their situations hard to scrutinise. But at least 17 cruise ship workers are confirmed to have died from suspected Covid-19  and dozens more have had to be evacuated from ships and taken to hospital  the Guardian found. “We all have family  we all want to go home ” said one crew member who has been isolating in his cabin onboard the MSC Seaview off South America for nearly a month  but is no longer being paid. The worker  who spoke via the internet and asked not to be named for fear of losing his job  said crew were initially allowed to move about the ship freely  but have been told to remain in their cabins since a worker who had already left the ship tested positive for Covid-19. “We have not received any information about when we’re going home or what they are doing to get crew members home ” said the worker. “We are just in the cabin like prisoners.” A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating  we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. “We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge  assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use. We’ve upgraded our menus  and are providing complimentary internet.” Most industry workers hail from developing countries such as the Philippines  Indonesia and India and generally earn between $1 000–$2 000 (£800- £1 600) a month for working seven days a week  according to Ross Klein  a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry. Documents seen by the Guardian show that at least one cruise line has stopped paying some workers who are trapped onboard. Those who died in April include two housekeeping staff  a bartender and a security guard who were evacuated from ships in Florida. An Italian ship’s doctor died in Brazil after being taken by ambulance from the Costa Fascinosa cruise ship  and an engine worker on the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer died in Uruguay after 128 of the 217 people onboard tested positive for coronavirus. Yet many nations  including the US  have baulked at providing even basic emergency services for these stranded crew members. “Some of these crews are in a no man’s land ” said John Hickey  a maritime lawyer. He said crew members did not have access to the rights afforded by their nations of citizenship  yet they were often outside the jurisdiction of the countries where their ships were sailing. Most of the cruise companies are registered in low-tax  low-regulation nations such as Panama or Liberia  with their ships flying the flags of territories such as the Bahamas or Bermuda  which are not prepared to care for thousands of sick crew. “It’s a big problem ” he said. “We are getting calls left and right. Crews are onboard  they’re not happy and they’re frightened.” As of 4 April  the US Coast Guard estimated that 93 000 crew members remained onboard ships in and around US waters alone. Tens of thousands more are on ships in other parts of the world  according to the Guardian’s analysis  which used the ship tracking site CruiseMapper and media reports to identify more than 50 ships that have had Covid-19 infections or confirmed exposures onboard. Cruises around the world were suspended on 14 March  yet many ports refused to let the ships dock long before that  meaning some crews have been stuck at sea for months. Cruise industry officials say they have been scrambling to repatriate crews that are not needed onboard during the shutdown  but port closures  travel bans and flight restrictions have made it extremely difficult. Some countries  including India  have almost completely sealed their borders  even to citizens. “The industry is committed to bringing passengers and crew home at its expense – without burdening governments ” the Cruise Line Industry Association said in a statement to the Guardian. “Flight restrictions and port closures have created some logistical challenges; however we are working through those as we speak. We are asking ports and governments around the world to allow these ships to come into port so that those onboard can make their way home safely and as quickly as possible.” Thousands of crew are sick or have been exposed to coronavirus. Outbreaks are raging in US waters  from the Miami coastline  where at least nine workers have been evacuated from the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas  to the docks of San Diego  where workers onboard the Disney Wonder have contracted coronavirus. In France  workers preparing to launch the new Celebrity Apex contracted Covid-19 even before the ship carried its first passengers. Some ships have medical supplies but few are equipped to handle full-blown outbreaks. All crew on the MSC Seaview are obliged to wear a mask and gloves onboard the cruise ship  which has basic medical equipment  a small emergency room and a laboratory. At least two doctors are caring for people on the vessel. “All crew members currently onboard are healthy and none have displayed any symptoms ” a spokesperson for MSC cruises said. “MSC Seaview has a full onboard medical centre equipped and staffed in line with the highest and most stringent international guidelines. We continue to conduct regular health and temperature checks to ensure their health.” The hundreds of crew members onboard the Ruby Princess ship  which departed from Australia on Thursday  marked their 30th day in quarantine on the ship on last week with a video thanking the medical workers who have cared for them. But the ships generally lack ventilators and other complicated medical equipment needed to treat Covid-19. In serious medical emergencies  passengers and crew on cruise ships are normally evacuated to a hospital on land for further care. Since the pandemic began  however  many countries are refusing to take them. , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/17/Sep/2018/25703364-a145-46b0-bcd0-bcd1dd5f571b-seascape-color-logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a7f65c3576b72b12bd856dba5c20884ca26ea3/0_62_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=948a885c3314d5e62f75323f152ece24 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58892d73450c088bb41dec9d358367a5e519b68b/0_0_4658_3073/master/4658.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=08114d2c2bc57eff3a12c9dcdb4759ad https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CCruises%2CTravel%2CUS+news%2CAustralia+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2COceans https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus,environment, ‘No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus, From the Galapagos to Dubai crew have been left marooned amid squabbles over who is responsible for their welfare, Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties  she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port. “It’s really scary  you don’t know how long it’s going to last ” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said  ‘can you get me some medicine  my head is going to explode’  they said  ‘there are people sicker than you  stay where you are’.” She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April  alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers  despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide. The ship is not an exception. Across the world  a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew. Nedeltcheva  who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria  may have been one of the lucky ones. Upwards of 100 000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships. Most have no communication with the outside world  and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian’s investigation  however  a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways  marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai. The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases  the Diamond Princess  was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated  Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria  which had just pulled into Southampton  were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard  according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider. In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas  from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida  that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances  according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald. Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises  which is owned by Royal Caribbean  is Julia Melim  a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms. The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land. A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe  healthy  cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.” The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected  but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships. “This accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally ” said the association in a statement. “It is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members  as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.” Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem  given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship  the Ruby Princess  which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March  has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus. “Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries ” said a 4 April CDC order  barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.” Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew  workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic  however  the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases. “They are basically getting no healthcare ” says Michael Winkleman  the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call  no one comes.” Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies  including Carnival and Royal Caribbean  are headquartered in the US  the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia  meaning they pay almost no US taxes. Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda  which allows them to avoid strict safety standards  labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US. US Coast Guard officials said in a memo on 29 March that outbreaks aboard ships are straining the rescue and medical resources in the Florida region. The bulletin  first obtained by the Miami Herald  asked ships carrying more than 50 people to prepare to provide their own medical care to those onboard for extended periods. “Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas  particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged  it added. Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo  saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships. “The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis  and we in the Bahamas  facing the same global crisis  are doing what we can to provide support ” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.” On some ships  crew members say they are being treated well  and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge  currently floating in the Bahamas  distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers. On other ships  the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out  and that they were forced to pay for internet time. Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line  according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian  are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating  we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge  assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.” A former crew member for another major cruise liner  Krista Thomas  who lives in Vancouver  has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home. She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods  and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home. “They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; they’re taking care of parents and in-laws ” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.” Ross Klein  who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises  says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them. “The workers are powerless ” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.” Alexandra Nedeltcheva  still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19  has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria  so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France.

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/two-pizzas-and-a-spliff-please-interpol-warns-of-lockdown-drug-deliveries,society, Two pizzas and a spliff please: Interpol warns of lockdown drug deliveries, Common sight of food couriers on streets providing ‘perfect cover’ for home drug deliveries, Cocaine  marijuana  ketamine and ecstasy are among the drugs being moved in pizza boxes or other takeaway containers in countries including Ireland  Malaysia  Spain and Britain  Interpol said. The agency issued a “purple notice” to warn its 194 member agencies of “this new modus operandi” involving couriers using bikes  motorcycles or cars. With drug buyers and their dealers under lockdown along with the rest of society in many countries  some drivers are using this time to make a quick buck  while in some cases dealers simply posed as couriers. Others were unwitting mules. “In one Malaysian case  a food delivery rider in the Gombak district of Kuala Lumpur contacted police and asked for his food package to be inspected after he became suspicious ” Interpol said. “The rider had been tasked with delivering a single order of Indian flatbread yet the parcel weighed approximately 11kg .” In Spain  seven people posing as delivery drivers were arrested in Alicante and Valencia after drugs were found concealed in the false bottoms of home delivery backpacks. In Ireland  police found 8kg of cocaine and two handguns hidden in pizza boxes. “Country-wide lockdowns have sharply increased demand for home delivered food and delivery drivers are a common sight on otherwise deserted streets ” Interpol said. This provides the perfect cover for home drug deliveries. “As criminals continue to adapt their activities to a world upended by Covid-19  Interpol’s purple notices are essential tools in enabling police around the world to learn from each other’s successes and address shifting crime patterns ” said Stephen Kavanagh  the agency’s executive director of police services. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d4121dc49ec9151301f5973a3c71b603d7c367/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3858b9a58d16a38c42b72b401a771593 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Drugs%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-african-anti-apartheid-activist-denis-goldberg-dies-ages-87-nelson-mandela,world, 'A giant has fallen': anti-apartheid activist Denis Goldberg dies aged 87, Close associate of Nelson Mandela spent 22 years in whites-only prison in South Africa, A statement from Goldberg’s family and the Denis Goldberg Legacy Foundation Trust said: “Denis Goldberg passed away just before midnight on Wednesday. His was a life well lived in the struggle for freedom in South Africa. We will miss him.” Born in 1933 in Cape Town into a leftwing Jewish family who had emigrated from the UK  Goldberg faced antisemitic attacks at school  which contributed to a growing political awareness. “I understood that what was happening in South Africa with its racism was like the racism in Nazi Germany in Europe that we were supposed to be fighting against ” he later said. Goldberg studied civil engineering and joined the banned Communist party in 1957. In 1960 he was jailed for four months after his arrest during protests following the shooting dead of 69 demonstrators by police in the Sharpeville massacre. On his release  he argued for the escalation of the fight against apartheid  and he became an official in the newly formed military wing of the African National Congress. Goldberg was arrested again in 1963 when the police raided a meeting of leading activists at Liliesleaf Farm  in the Rivonia suburb in the north of Johannesburg  and he was charged with organising a campaign of “violent revolution”. The same raid led to Mandela’s conviction and life sentence. Mandela later recounted Goldberg’s humour during the court proceedings  known as the Rivonia trial. “There was a good deal of gallows humour among us. Denis Goldberg  the youngest of the accused  had an irrepressible sense of humour and often had us laughing when we should not have been ” the Nobel prize laureate wrote. Having faced a potential death sentence  Goldberg responded to his life sentence by shouting to his wife and mother in the gallery: “Life! To live!” He was held in virtual isolation in the whites-only Pretoria Central prison for more than two decades  and allowed only very rare and short meetings with his family. Released in 1985  Goldberg travelled to London where he raised support for the struggle against apartheid. He returned to South Africa in 2002. In recent years Goldberg worked to raise funds for the House of Hope  a space to support young people in impoverished communities around the suburb of Hout Bay  in Cape Town. He had lung cancer and diabetes  and died peacefully at his home in Hout Bay. “A giant has fallen. A truly great South African ” said Eusebius McKaiser  a radio host and journalist. Ronnie Kasrils  a veteran anti-apartheid activist and politician  said Goldberg was an “outstanding  remarkable South African and human being”. Sello Hatang  the chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation  said South Africa had lost “another true patriot … [whose] life was dedicated to the struggle against apartheid and the building of democracy”. Receiving the Freedom of the City of London in 2016  Goldberg said there was “a long way to go” on race relations in South Africa. “The racial segregation was burnt into the minds of every South African ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f22fe02171eca7dd44e96688e5f2d43c4e155807/0_280_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6ddb7e539cccc8fd8528d086049a5a3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=South+Africa%2CNelson+Mandela%2CAfrica%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/eurozone-suffers-record-slump-as-coronavirus-lockdown-reverses-growth,business, As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come, Christine Lagarde says there could be a 15% collapse after record first quarter output fall, After news that the 19-nation monetary union area had contracted a record 3.8% in the first three months of 2020  Christine Lagarde said much worse was possible in the April to June period  when the impact of lockdown restrictions would be most severe. “The eurozone economy has contracted at a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peacetime ” said the ECB president  as she announced modest new measures to encourage bank lending and keep financial markets functioning. In its first meeting since before large parts of Europe were shut down in response to the spread of Covid-19  the ECB decided not to cut its main interest rate or to increase the size and scope of its quantitative easing programme. The central bank’s forecasts suggest that the eurozone could contract by between 5% and 12% in 2020 as a whole  but policymakers kept most of its ammunition in reserve. Lagarde urged eurozone politicians to cooperate on an ambitious package of spending measures to support economic recovery. The ECB president spoke hours after the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat reported the sharpest decline in eurozone activity since monetary union was launched more than two decades ago. France and Italy  the second and third biggest economies in the monetary union area  fell into recession as the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat reported a bigger fall in gross domestic product in the quarter ending in March than the financial markets had been expecting. Of the individual eurozone countries publishing data  France said that after a decline of 0.1% in the final three months of 2019  its economy had contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020  the steepest decline since modern records began in the late 1940s. Italy also had its second successive quarter of economic decline  contracting by 4.7% following a 0.3% decline in late 2019. The impact of Covid-19 on an already weak economy was enough to wipe out all the gains in GDP since the global financial crisis of 2008. Spain  one of the countries most seriously affected by Covid-19  reported a quarterly drop of 5.2%  while Belgian and Austrian GDPs fell by 3.9% and 2.5%  respectively. Germany did not release its growth figures but the effects of the pandemic on the eurozone’s biggest economy were underlined by a 373 000 increase in unemployment and a jump to 10.1 million workers on reduced hours in April. The eurozone was barely growing before the Covid-19 shock  registering expansion of 0.1% in the final three months of 2019. A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of falling output  and analysts said it was now certain that the eurozone as a whole would suffer its biggest slump since its creation at the end of the 1990s. The eurozone’s contraction in the first quarter was far more pronounced than that recorded by the US. On Wednesday the US commerce department said the GDP of the world’s biggest economy had fallen by an annualised 4.8% between January and March  equivalent to a quarterly decline of just over 1%. Andrew Kenningham  a European economist at the consultancy Capital Economics  said the size of the hit to eurozone GDP should embolden the ECB to step up its support for growth. “The blizzard of depressing economic data released on Thursday morning confirms that the eurozone economy was in freefall at the end of March  with GDP dropping by a record amount throughout the region ” he said. Bert Colijn  a eurozone economist for ING bank  said: “France and Spain have been among the most strict in terms of lockdowns and hence their economies have suffered more. This would suggest that a country like Germany has experienced a smaller than average contraction.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a743ce986054957103fc6efc76b2ef27f95fb0a5/0_188_5698_3422/master/5698.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96d7ddcd0337bcc5643d5549335e08b9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Eurozone%2CBusiness%2CEurope%2CGlobal+economy%2CGlobal+recession%2CInternational+trade%2CEconomics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CGermany%2CSpain%2CFrance%2CBelgium%2CAustria%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/more-help-needed-for-british-industrial-sector-says-head-of-make-uk,business, More help needed for British industrial sector  says head of Make UK, Manufacturers will face issues ‘for some time’ after coronavirus lockdown ends  ministers told, Make UK – the body that represents manufacturers – said ministers might need to look beyond the provision of subsidised loans if they were to help producers through a slump on course to be even more severe than current official estimates. With its latest survey showing a dramatic fall in orders and sales  Make UK is particularly concerned about the outlook for larger mid-sized firms that are not listed on the stock exchange but form a vital part of the UK’s manufacturing base. Stephen Phipson  Make UK’s chief executive  said: “All the indications at the moment indicate that  even if a gradual easing of lockdowns begins soon  the impact of this shock will continue to hit companies and livelihoods for some time to come. As such  government may need to be flexible with its future support schemes in the same way that industry is going to have to be flexible with its recovery plans.” In its lobbying of ministers  the employers’ organisation has been arguing that there will be a medium-term need for government to support a recapitalisation effort for businesses that will struggle to repay debt incurred during lockdown. “Some of the current schemes don’t work for everyone  with a lot of firms very nervous about taking on big debts in this climate with no certainty about when they can repay it ” Phipson said. “In that context  government should be working with the banks and other partners to consider a wider range of options.” In its projection of the likely path of the economy this year  the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected manufacturing output to fall by 55% in the second quarter. Make UK said that on the basis of its survey of almost 300 companies  the fall in manufacturing was likely to be larger and that conditions were unlikely to return to anything like normal for some time to come. It urged the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  to consider extending the government’s furloughing scheme beyond the end of June. Its survey showed: Phipson said: “While many manufacturers continue to operate and supply our food  vital medical equipment and PPE  there is no disguising that for the sector overall these are deeply worrying times. “The extent of the collapse in demand is such it means that the recent OBR forecast could be an underestimate unless there is a quite remarkable turnaround  which  to be frank  just isn’t going to happen.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e623bd2a26ffce73ac7f81366f4fdd80dce553/0_208_3796_2276/master/3796.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b1b4de3aad4298ab586cf76bcb56af6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Manufacturing+sector%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/us-unemployment-americans-jobless-coronavirus-pandemic,business, Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow, Pace of job losses appears to be slowing but figures increase and many people yet to receive benefits as backlog hits US system, The latest figures from the labor department released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging  the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The figures are also still undercounting the number of people out of work. Some states are still dealing with backlogs of claims after their systems were overwhelmed by the massive volume of applications. Florida has become a notable black spot. As of Tuesday the state had received more than 1.9 million claims and processed just over 664 000  one of the slowest rates in the nation. Kia Washington  22  lost her job at Scarlett’s  a club in Fort Myers  on 16 March. She has yet to receive unemployment benefits or the $1 200 stimulus cheque she is entitled to from the federal bailout. Washington said every time she has tried to file her claim online she has been kicked out of the system  and that she had been trying at 4am or later in the hope of getting through but to no avail. She sent in a paper application three weeks ago but has yet to have a reply. She is currently living with her grandparents. “If I didn’t have them  I would be out on the streets ” she said. The pace of layoffs may slow further as states begin to open up for business once more. But some have warned that relaxing quarantine rules could trigger another wave of infections and shutdowns and the virus has already done significant damage to the economy. Many large US companies have announced cuts to staff or are planning layoffs. Boeing announced this week that the coronavirus had delivered “a body blow” to its business and is weighing laying off 16 000 people  a 10% cut to its 161 000 workforce. Hertz  the car rental company  recently laid off about 10 000 employees in North America and is reportedly considering bankruptcy. On Tuesday the commerce department announced the US economy shrank 4.8% in the first three months of the year  its steepest decline since the last recession and ending a decade of near constant economic growth. Kevin Hassett  senior economic adviser to Donald Trump has warned that the jobless rate in the US could spike to between 16% and 20% by June. According to the latest Department of Labor figures  the insured unemployment rate – the number of people currently receiving unemployment insurance as a percentage of the labor force  was 12.4% for the week ending 18 April   the highest percentage recorded since the department started releasing those figures. Next Friday the bureau of labor statistics releases its official jobs report for themonth of April. The monthly report is regarded as a more accurate snapshot of the jobs market but often lags the weekly report. In March the jobless rate rose 0.9%  the largest single-month change since January 1975  to 4.4%. The pandemic shutdowns started in late March  so April will give a more accurate picture of their impact on the jobs market. JP Morgan is predicting unemployment could reach 20%. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9f5b1473a9ae9e4cd4b1d3b405f56b5392bf10/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=928dd5039fba60b0a5086580c8f37f12 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd51dfe148fec5769442f81f101a03d26df52628/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00ae0c5568ee062458a4721a8c3ca268 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acb060bb9fd5654d192a280c9eec4c7c8a523ff/0_40_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46e7cfd6549f890ac77d642bff37ea60 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1301d7b23ac0ace5e0f4fb75ac535e9cb20ab8/0_32_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c06e13fbba60b4732a34a39321a99c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf35917022d3725c5b66fea9ebaa96b64e7e0f37/131_0_2413_1448/master/2413.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e04f1eb0f66c00ebda77eb8ff2198d8 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=US+economy%2CUS+unemployment+and+employment+data%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CUS+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-scheme,business, UK Treasury rushes to finalise coronavirus bounce back loan scheme, Details of Rishi Sunak’s small business support yet to be agreed  days ahead of launch, The new “bounce back” loan scheme was announced by the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  at the start of the week with some key details still to be ironed out  and is scheduled to become available on Monday. Some banks are concerned that the chancellor’s pledge to distribute cash within 24 hours of receiving a funding request could prove unrealistic  and are still waiting to confirm the questions that will be included in the scheme’s one-page application form. The Treasury is expected to force banks to offer a standardised interest rate or cap on the loans once the initial 12-month interest-free period runs out. That rate could be set as early as Friday once UK banks hand in their own pricing information  though there has been speculation that the number could end up around 2.5%. Neither of the existing government-backed loan schemes have involved capping rates. Some lenders are also worried that they may breach regulations by taking part in the scheme. Preparations are expected to continue throughout the weekend  according to industry sources  who said it could come down to the wire. There has been precedent for last-minute revisions: it is understood that term sheets for the original programme for aiding small businesses  the coronavirus interruption loan scheme (CBILS)  were not completed until 3am on the day of its launch on 23 March. It is understood that even after the new scheme is launched  the rules for the bounce back loan scheme will be kept under review by the Treasury and the City regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority. Figures released by the banking industry trade body on Thursday showed that 25 262 CBILS loans worth £4.1bn have so far been distributed to small and medium-sized businesses. That equates to only 48% of the 52 807 businesses that have applied. By contrast  France said it expected to distribute €40bn (£35bn) worth of loans to local businesses by the end of the month. The bounce back loan scheme offers 100% government-backed loans to small businesses worth up to 25% of their turnover  up to £50 000. The standardised application  which is expected to be an online form  is expected to speed up the process for businesses affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown. Lenders have been accused of dragging their heels on CBILS and being too slow to distribute the loans  which are 80% backed by the government. However  banks have said they have been carrying out the appropriate checks and have been working overtime to get money to customers. Banks are concerned they could be breaching regulatory duties to carry out affordability checks for their smallest business borrowers  who are protected by the Consumer Credit Act. Under those rules  banks have to make sure borrowers fully understand the terms of the loan  otherwise the loan contract could be cancelled. Senior managers are now legally accountable for any errors made on lending practices. In normal circumstances  changes to the act would require a change to UK legislation. Banks are now waiting to see whether the FCA will give concrete guidance on how the rules might be relaxed without requiring MPs to vote through emergency changes. A spokesperson for the banking industry trade association  UK Finance  said: “This scheme is a vital part of the support provided to help business at this time. The industry has worked closely with HMT on the development of the scheme.” The Treasury and FCA were contacted for comment.

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/lloyds-bank-profits-crash-95-to-cover-expected-surge-in-bad-debts,business, Lloyds profits crash 95% as bank covers expected surge in bad debts, Bank sets aside £1.4bn for potential defaults by customers struggling amid coronavirus lockdown, The first-quarter provision is meant to cover potential defaults by customers over the coming months  as they struggle to keep up with payments due to the UK’s nationwide lockdown. Lloyds is the UK’s largest provider of home loans  one of its biggest backers of businesses and is often viewed as a bellwether for the British economy. The front-loaded costs nearly wiped out pre-tax profits  which collapsed year-on-year from £1.6bn to just £74m for the three-month period to March. Lloyds was expected to set aside around £1.1bn worth of impairments  according to analysts  who had forecast profits of about £860m. The bank said it was expecting to put aside more money to cover bad loans in the second quarter  but said it was difficult to forecast given the “significant uncertainty.” Lloyds chief executive António Horta-Osório said: “The coronavirus pandemic presents an unprecedented social and economic challenge which is having a significant impact on people and businesses in the UK and around the world. “The economic outlook is clearly challenging with the longer-term outcome dependent on the severity and length of the pandemic and the mitigating impact of Government and other measures in the UK and across the world. “Throughout this period of uncertainty we will continue to work closely with government  regulators and other authorities and use the strength of our balance sheet and business model to ensure that we play our part in supporting our customers and the UK economy.” Lloyds is the latest lender to lay bare the likely costs of the pandemic. On Wednesday  Barclays reported a 38% drop in pre-tax profits to £913m after taking a £2.1bn charge to cover bad debts  which it predicts could soar to £4.5bn by the end of the year. Earlier this week  HSBC warned it could end up setting aside $11bn (£8.8bn) to cover loan losses for 2020  after the pandemic hit its main markets across Asia and Europe. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3340df7c15c60b619446af19166a7fa653775b56/478_263_3482_2092/master/3482.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59508d99249f2508e0300e6ff031bb57 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Lloyds+Banking+Group%2CBanking%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CBorrowing+%26+debt%2CMoney%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/shell-cuts-dividend-for-first-time-since-1945-amid-oil-price-collapse,business, Shell cuts dividend for first time since 1945 amid oil price collapse, First-quarter payout from FTSE 100’s biggest dividend payer to fall by two-thirds amid coronavirus crisis, The energy giant told its shareholders  including thousands of retail investors and pension funds  that it would be in their best interests for payouts to fall for the first time in almost 80 years. The payout is being cut by 66%  from $15bn last year to $5bn this year. Ben van Buerden  Shell’s chief executive  said the “monumental” decision to reset the company’s dividend was difficult but necessary to preserve the financial resilience of the company against a “crisis of uncertainty”. Shell is the biggest dividend payer in the FTSE 100 and the quarterly payout will fall by two-thirds to 16 cents a share. The company described the move as a “prudent” step in weathering the impact of the Covid-19 on the oil markets and the global economy. Shell’s share price fell by 11%. Its market value has fallen by 44% since the beginning of this year  the fastest rate in the company’s history  and it has lost its place as the FTSE 100’s most valuable company to drugs maker Astrazeneca. “We do not consider that maintaining the current level of the dividend is in the best interest of shareholders or the company ” Van Beurden said. “No CEO wants on their track record a cut to the dividend which is iconic in the market. But the situation we are facing is totally unprecedented.” The collapse in global oil prices to 21 year lows following the outbreak of the pandemic earlier this year caused Shell’s profits for the first quarter to tumble to $2.9bn (£2.3bn)  down 46% from $5.3bn in the same quarter last year. The impact in the second quarter will “more severe”  Van Beurden said. Shell plans to scrap all executive bonuses for this financial year  and rein in spending and costs to save up to $9bn. The company will “probably” consider voluntary redundancies. “That is not going to happen anytime soon  if at all this year. But if this goes on  it is inevitable that there will be consequences ” Van Beurden said. Shell’s decision to cut its dividend for the first time in almost 80 years breaks with a decades-long taboo among major oil companies against cutting shareholder returns. Shell will also stall plans to buy back the shares which it paid to shareholders in lieu of dividends during the previous oil market downturn in 2015. Earlier this week  BP’s new chief executive  Bernard Looney  said the company’s board had decided not to cut its dividend for the first quarter despite plunging to a loss. BP has cut its dividend only twice in the last 30 years  most recently in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010  which led to 11 fatalities and a bill topping $65bn. He did not rule out future cuts to manage a slow oil market recovery. The market narrative regarding Shell’s dividend record will need to change  Van Beurden added. It will no longer be “‘no cuts since World War Two’  it is ‘no cuts since the last pandemic’ ” he said. Van Beurden said he does not expect a recovery in global oil markets or the world’s demand for oil over the medium term  meaning the company would need to prepare for the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. The chief executive added that the collapse of global oil markets raises the likelihood that the world will reach ‘peak oil demand’ within the next decade. This may mean that the company shows preference to clean energy projects “which serve us better in the future”  he said. Chad Holliday  the chairman of Shell’s board  said: “Shareholder returns are a fundamental part of Shell’s financial framework. However  given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty  weaker commodity prices  higher volatility and uncertain demand outlook  the board believes that maintaining the current level of shareholder distributions is not prudent.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2144fe334854022d6928c60c100267a97fc00313/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=214c67a6f8fddac392a1356b592f934a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac98d8317ec0bd1d1e5afca8690f3e26076e587/0_66_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad99cea51619987a583787bda390c265 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6e59ba1903895f68a511720f7fc411c6edb2ad/0_122_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b1adc477c01c2ee120db92b1759a3c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347b40977863c915aea55c0438f644c889497550/0_257_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15a22c573ba4efdca17b5f2ae15ea975 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4311da7e0da21fced07b59659638026c8648e4a6/0_148_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83076b2c69ab86a92d76ff0d6729d75d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Royal+Dutch+Shell%2CBusiness%2COil%2CCommodities%2COil+and+gas+companies%2CEnergy+industry%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

Thanks to its unique design  it has been repaired and upgraded five times by visiting astronauts and this has made it one of Nasa’s longest-lived and most valuable observatories. Only the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 put a stop to future servicing missions. Being above the atmosphere means Hubble has been able to take extremely sharp images and these often spectacular vistas have found their way into the public’s consciousness. One of Hubble’s primary goals was to measure the speed at which the universe is expanding. It did this with such extraordinary precision that it revealed the expansion was accelerating. To power the acceleration  cosmologists now believe that a mysterious energy field  known as dark energy  must be among the universe’s principal components. Nasa in collaboration with the European Space Agency  which is a partner on Hubble  is launching the James Webb space telescope sometime in the next few years. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48ce4c5a985e7c06faadf6f81663b72578dfeb9/0_219_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ae6c98dbd626f772c81994ded3db5d1 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Space%2CAstronomy%2CHubble+space+telescope%2CScience%2CNasa%2CEuropean+Space+Agency https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/hospital-chiefs-increasingly-frustrated-with-uk-testing-failures,world, Hospital chiefs 'increasingly frustrated' with UK testing failures, NHS Providers lambasts comprehensively missed target of 100 000 daily test as a ‘red herring’, NHS Providers  which represents foundation trusts in England  rounded on ministers for “a series of frequent tactical announcements” to expand testing criteria  and dismissed the 100 000 target as a “red herring” that distracted from their failures. Just 33 000 people were tested for Covid-19 in the latest 24-hour period – a record high for a single day – according to official figures. Dominic Raab  the first secretary of state  said that more than 52 000 tests were carried out  but this total is apparently bolstered by 19 000 retests. Test capacity was now more than 73 000 a day  he said – still considerably below the target set by the health secretary  Matt Hancock  at the start of April. Comprehensive testing – combined with tracing those who have come into contact with sufferers  and containing the spread through careful self-isolation – has been described as the route out of lockdown while avoiding a serious second peak. On Wednesday ministers confirmed that total UK coronavirus deaths had exceeded 26 000. In recent days  testing has been expanded from hospital patients and NHS workers to key workers and  on Tuesday  to all symptomatic over-65s  those who need to go out to work  care home residents and staff. The swab tests can be booked online and carried out at drive-through test centres or using home kits. NHS Providers said in a report released on Wednesday: “NHS trust leaders believe they have done all they can to support the national testing effort so far but are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clarity on how the testing regime will be developed for this next phase. “At the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups with no visibility on any longer term strategy  and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.” Chris Hopson  its chief executive  added that the 100 000 target may have a “galvanising effect” but “what matters most is an updated strategy to take us through the exit from lockdown”. He added: “Trusts stand ready to play their part in delivering that new testing regime  but they need to know a lot more  as quickly as possible  to play that part effectively. “The NHS has achieved so much in confronting the challenges posed by coronavirus. However testing is one area where  despite all the work delivered by trusts and the NHS  the health and care system as a whole has struggled to develop an effective  coordinated approach. Further criticism came from Andy Burnham  the mayor of Manchester  who said the goal had been set and driven forward without local consultation. Burnham  a health secretary in Gordon Brown’s government  said the drive to hit the target had been done in a “haphazard way” without local consultation. At a meeting of the region’s Covid-19 emergency committee on Wednesday  he welcomed the increase in testing capacity but warned a more strategic and co-ordinated approach was needed. “Lots of frustration [was] expressed at the meeting about arrangements for testing and what feels to people to be a confused picture across Greater Manchester with different capacity and overlapping schemes  and still capacity being put in without any reference to local authorities ” he told a press conference. “It feels to us as though the government has been chasing the target on testing without fully thinking through the strategy at a local level and involving local leaders.” Prof John Newton from Public Health England (PHE)  who has been charged with increasing testing numbers  has said he is confident the 100 000 daily target will be met on time once numbers are finalised. With just one day to go  there was evidence of a significant push to increase the numbers and hit the goal. Hancock urged a wider range of people to apply for tests in an email sent out from Conservative central office. The over-65s or anyone who has to go out to work – or their families – could apply online for a test if they had symptoms. “This means construction workers to emergency plumbers  research scientists to those in manufacturing – can now be tested ” he said. On Twitter  the department gave locations of the mobile testing units. “If you’re eligible for a test and near one of these sites you can book in now ” it said. A Guardian analysis of the data suggests that around 20% more tests are carried out each day than there are people tested. On Tuesday  that rose to a high of 37%. The reasons are unclear  but it is known that retests because of results that doctors disbelieve are not uncommon. In hospitals  that can be because doctors are convinced a patient has Covid-19 and do not believe a negative result  so get the test repeated. Although the lab processing is very accurate  getting enough swab sample of the virus from the back of the mouth or nose can be difficult. PHE said that originally people with symptoms would have a swab test of the back of the mouth and another one of the nose  but now there is a move to obtaining just one sample. That might mean a greater likelihood of retesting. The government is not keeping a record of the number of inconclusive tests but  according to a departmental spokesperson  these are rare. As of 9am on 29 April 818 539 tests had been carried out on 632 794 individuals  meaning 23% of all tests carried out to that date were retests. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said that some people are tested more than once for clinical reasons. “The number of people tested is the number of new people tested each day ” he said. “The number of overall tests could include the same person tested multiple times  hence the widening gap.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6995bb40e8900730edf204b8ce5b9ce72dc77da/0_157_5494_3298/master/5494.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=631a96c9c3bfb1b2f26c1cf3330170ee https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926d461138e75cb287f6288ea25075d46bd87b6d/0_111_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c22eb36e4214a20cc793def91bfad238 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CHealth%2CHealth+policy%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19,world, NHS looks into taking BAME staff off frontline for their safety, Drive to risk-assess minority ethnic workers aims to reduce higher death rate from Covid-19, BAME personnel should be “risk-assessed” and reassigned to duties that leave them at lesser risk of contracting coronavirus  under guidance set out by NHS bosses in England. The move was unveiled in a letter sent on Wednesday to hospital trusts  providers of mental health care  ambulance services and organisations providing community-based healthcare. It makes clear that the new guidance was prompted by growing evidence that people of BAME origin are more at risk from Covid-19  and by the need to save lives. The nine-page letter  from NHS improvement’s chief operating officer  Amanda Pritchard  was sent to those running NHS care organisations across England. It said: “Emerging UK and international data suggest that people from black  Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are also being disproportionately affected by Covid-19.” It references the fact that the Department of Health and Social Care has already asked Public Health England to investigate and report back on the unusually high number of BAME people  including workers in the NHS  who are falling ill and dying from the disease It then tells local NHS leaders: “In advance of their report and guidance  on a precautionary basis we recommend employers should risk-assess staff at potentially greater risk and make appropriate arrangements accordingly.” It does not outline what specific measures they should take to protect the safety of their BAME staff  but it is understood that the new drive to reduce the BAME death toll would allow such personnel to be redeployed to areas or services where they would have less chance of becoming infected. They may also be given priority for testing if they develop symptoms. One in five of NHS staff in England are from a BAME background  as are about half of all doctors in London. Some NHS trusts have already recognised the extra risk faced by their BAME workforce and taken steps to reduce that. For example  Somerset NHS foundation trust  which provides a wide range of medical services in the county  has classed them as “vulnerable and at risk”. It has begun asking BAME staff if they feel safe at work  giving them priority for testing and ensuring that they undergo a “fit-test” in order to wear an FFP3 ventilator mask  which all health professionals working with Covid-positive patients are meant to use as a key part of their personal protective equipment. Outlining the measures  the trust’s chief executive  Peter Lewis  told BAME staff: “Many of you will be concerned about the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME colleagues in the UK. We understand that this is worrying and we want to do all we can to ensure you feel safe and supported during this difficult time. “Your wellbeing is very important. We have heard that many BAME colleagues are understandably worried about their own and their families’ health at this time.” The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. They are also overrepresented among the number of NHS staff who have died with the virus. It is not known why such a disparity exists. But some experts have cited social deprivation and higher rates of cancer  diabetes and heart disease among some BAME groups as likely factors  along with the fact that minority ethnic people make up a greater number of those employed in key worker roles who receive greater exposure to the virus , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7028a0e73e028fad17b00f13cfd9b683815860/0_0_5017_3011/master/5017.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7219423f60f4ade3c1cfdd14d77d5958 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CRace%2CNHS%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CHospitals https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/guardian-reports-surge-in-readers-support-over-past-year,media, Guardian reports surge in readers’ support over past year, 821 000 people now making financial contributions  up a quarter on last year, There were 821 000 readers making regular monthly contributions at the end of March  up a quarter over the last year  driven by new subscribers to the company’s apps and continuing financial contributions from readers. There were notable increases in the number of people subscribing to the premium version of the Guardian’s mobile phone and tablet app  plus people subscribing to the Daily edition and the new Guardian Puzzles app. About half of the regular contributors are from outside the UK  aided by growing numbers of readers in Australia  the US and across Europe. Guardian Media Group’s preliminary financial results  unveiled to staff on Wednesday  led the company to state that it “achieved its goal of financial sustainability for a second consecutive year”. This means its cash requirements can be covered by the expected long-term annual returns of £25-30m produced by the Scott Trust  the not-for-profit organisation that ultimately owns the Guardian and Observer. Full accounts are due to be released in July and the company said the main focus was on keeping the wider Guardian Media Group business sustainable. Katharine Viner  the Guardian News & Media editor-in-chief  said: “Over the last 12 months the Guardian has provided independent  fact-based journalism to unprecedented numbers of readers. Readership and financial support from readers have grown at record rates during the past two months of the coronavirus. “While the future is tough for news organisations  we are very grateful to Guardian readers around the world  who are helping us to ensure that high-quality news is accessible to everyone  not just those who can afford it.” The new figures only cover the financial year to the end of March  meaning they largely cover a period before the imposition of coronavirus lockdowns that have caused the global advertising market to collapse. Since then  the company has taken measures to reduce costs by at least £10m and furloughed some non-editorial staff  while conducting a review of parts of the business that has led to senior executives taking pay cuts. The Guardian Media Group’s chief executive  Annette Thomas  said: “The appetite for trusted  authoritative news and information has never been larger  but news media organisations face huge challenges: widespread disruption in the advertising sector  structural decline in print sales and rapidly changing habits of news consumption. Like others  the Guardian will face significant financial challenges over the next 12 months as a result of coronavirus.” The Guardian’s reporting on the coronavirus pandemic has attracted record online traffic  with a University of Oxford study this week suggesting it is the most trusted UK newspaper for reporting on Covid-19. The weak state of the online advertising market has meant that increased audiences have not translated into financial returns  although it has led to a further surge in contributions from readers. GMG said that when one-off donations were included  at least 1.16 million people around the world financially supported the Guardian in some way during the last financial year  in addition to the British readers who support it by buying the Guardian and Observer print editions. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35146af4c173d4d6694e8d443b8741a26ceb8d8/0_111_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48b02f4914325af126c5ed8b335fd98a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=The+Guardian%2CGuardian+Media+Group%2CNational+newspapers%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CMedia+business%2CMedia%2CNewspapers%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

This alone will not be enough to make up the shortfall  meaning there are likely to be cuts to some programmes. Discussions over the appointment of a new director general are also continuing remotely  with the process to appoint a new boss to lead the BBC still on track to be concluded by June  according to sources at the corporation. Income from the TV licence is forecast to be below expectations  with door-to-door enforcement activity stopped during the pandemic and a call centre that handles payments shut down because of physical distancing rules. The BBC has also been hit by the decision to delay the introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s  which had been due to come into place this year but was deferred when older people were asked to self-isolate at home. The financial outlook for the BBC is substantially better than many of its commercial rivals. Channel 4’s advertising revenue has halved since the start of the lockdown as the economy grinds to a halt  forcing it to cut its programme budget by around a quarter. Lord Hall told staff the BBC was receiving less income from its commercial operations than had been planned  with production of programmes that are sold to other broadcasters put on hold and a major slump in advertising income on its global outlets. He said spending on capital projects  overheads and technology would be reviewed  with hiring only allowed for roles that are used to support “the BBC’s output and ability to perform immediate  essential operations”. The corporation’s reputation  which took a battering from politicians and the government during the 2019 general election  has been boosted by its response to the coronavirus pandemic with enormous audiences tuning into its news output and substantial investment in its education service to aid children unable to attend school. However  questions remain over the fate of the 450 BBC staff whose jobs were due to be cut this year as part of an enormous reorganisation of the news division. These cuts were postponed as the scale of the pandemic and the drain on the BBC’s resources became apparent  leaving employees working during the outbreak but wondering if they will still have jobs when the lockdown lifts. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40157cbfd82899045087fed9fa365c3bda1b4c9a/938_26_2485_1492/master/2485.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=11a5bf317b045b425cc0444f1d1bfc50 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e128006d9117ccf32daa53f296ecc66adf216e/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc5ab7eb78d2f8edb6150ca5ec3a56c3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdebbcaf478bdc20a8c36385bd1a557340427c1c/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a56c22932253bfff3e583f0c914410a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54989e584ba91330df9fb5bcdbc64d2f2a9d99b/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa9f8819536b38bdf23d5a13f8bc70ef https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97089100ca426c91a2b7a7471e0cd42ea1f27062/0_232_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c80dfc4e88bc2901c5ba3ed2388476c8 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=BBC%2CTony+Hall%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMedia%2CUK+news%2CCulture%2CTelevision+industry%2CThe+news+on+TV%2CTelevision%2CRadio https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/channel-4-commissions-through-the-keyhole-with-dogs,world, Pets get cameras as channels are forced to innovate in pandemic, Channel 4’s new show Snoop Dogs is sign of push to find ways to film TV while physical distancing, Snoop Dogs  a rapidly commissioned series announced on Wednesday  recreates the feel of Through the Keyhole by offering viewers the chance to take a tour of a celebrity’s house and guess who lives there. The twist is that because producers can’t access people’s homes due to physical distancing  the crew are strapping cameras to the celebrity’s pets and sending the animals in to do the filming. The show’s announcement – which immediately led to it being dubbed ‘Through the Catflap’ and ‘Beagle’s About’ – comes amid warnings that broadcasters are at risk of running out of high-quality original television programmes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Global television production ground to a halt in mid-March  destroying long-planned shooting schedules and leading to warnings that viewers will notice a lack of material on-screen for years to come. EastEnders  already broadcasting on a reduced schedule  is at risk of running out of new episodes by the summer  while this autumn’s Strictly Come Dancing could be filmed without a studio audience. In response the industry is now seeking programmes that can be filmed while abiding by physical distancing rules – prompting talk of sending keen young actors  directors  and crew into long-term quarantine in order to restart filming and keep popular shows on air and the nation entertained. New series of long-running BBC shows such as The Apprentice  Top Gear  and Dragons’ Den are also set to be delayed. Ian Katz  Channel 4’s director of programming  said the pandemic and the prospect of months of lockdown will inevitably force his channel to seek out projects that are easier to film in a world with reduced movement – and reduced budgets. This could mean “smaller casts  or more contained precincts  or involve younger casts” he told a virtual session of the Edinburgh TV festival conducted on YouTube. Although his team pushed to finish filming on some projects in early March as it became apparent that the lockdown would shut down production – meaning they can now be edited remotely for broadcast – other programmes were less lucky. The result is that big Channel 4 programmes such as The Great British Bake Off have been delayed indefinitely  while production of some high-end scripted dramas were pulled off air mid-shoot. This raises questions about whether the original footage will have to be scrapped even if production can be resumed many months later. “There isn’t scope to be making drama for quite a few months ” said Katz  suggesting there may be an increased need to rely on archive footage as he announced new commissions such as Ramadan in Lockdown and Sex Tips in Isolation. He added that this posed a problem for broadcasters as audiences are desperate to watch shows that don’t involve people trapped at home: “This craving for escapism is only going to get greater.” His comments echo those made by Piers Wenger  head of BBC drama commissioning  who said on Tuesday that one option under consideration by the corporation is “quarantining actors and crew in order to allow actors to interact in the same space”. British-filmed productions are likely to be prioritised over foreign productions. Wenger said the BBC was also looking at ways to film new episodes while observing physical distancing rules by looking to the Australian television industry: “There are ways of cheating  actors being close enough together to act in a scene. Neighbours is experimenting with different ways of shooting while social distancing is in place.” As a result the cost of unloved already-produced shows has suddenly jumped  with the likes of Netflix keen to use its chequebook to buy up programmes that had been filmed pre-lockdown but are available for purchase in certain territories. ITV Studios  which makes programmes for many broadcasters  has been advertising shows it made for audiences in the US and China which they hope to sell to broadcasters elsewhere in the world. There is also the risk that commercial broadcasters  who are currently seeing record-high viewing figures with record-low advertising income as the economy contracts  could be left with major gaps in their autumn and winter schedules. Channel 4 has already had to make enormous cuts to its programming budget in order to avoid financial collapse. Charlotte Moore  BBC director of content  told an Edinburgh TV festival session that audiences were tiring of programmes that look like they were filmed on videoconference calls and are instead yearning for more substantive and slick programmes. “We’re very keen not everything is made on Zoom ” she said. “At the moment people are enjoying ‘we’re all in it together’ and seeing inside everyone’s house … But there’s also a massive appetite for all the flashy shows.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/090660cce7072c7824772ba69170c92da4817cd0/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db0227266f24c7e3dc076253524644aa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/481417759afdd31f71d5bc786041cb449cff489c/0_0_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=742b409b73112e7473fc2cc82da2f36c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CTelevision%2CChannel+4%2CBBC%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/politicians-boris-johnson-carrie-symonds-baby-downing-street-congratulations,politics, 'Sorry we didn’t leave the cot!': politicians cheer PM and Symonds, Boris Johnson plans to take a delayed paternity leave with crucial coronavirus decisions to be made, His partner  Carrie Symonds  gave birth at an NHS hospital in London in the early hours  with a spokesman for the couple saying both mother and son were doing well. Johnson was present throughout the birth of the boy  who may have arrived some weeks early given that Symonds was due in “early summer”. Although Johnson missed prime minister’s questions at noon on Wednesday  he was already back at his desk in Downing Street by early afternoon and taking part in a phone call with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Having taken three weeks off to be treated for and recuperate from coronavirus  it is understood Johnson is determined to be present in Downing Street for the crucial decisions that need to be taken in the coming weeks on exiting the lockdown. He had been planning to take two weeks of paternity leave  but a spokesman said this has been delayed until later in the year – although new fathers must officially take it within 56 days of a birth. Johnson is also keen to preserve privacy around the birth of his son. He has four children with his estranged second wife  Marina Wheeler – Lara Lettice  26  Milo Arthur  24  Cassia Peaches  22  and Theodore Apollo  20 – as well as another child with the art consultant Helen Macintyre. Beyond that  he has always declined to say how many sons and daughters he has overall. “The prime minister is delighted by the birth of his baby son and I’m not going to comment on his other children ” the press secretary said. The spokesman would not name the hospital that delivered the baby  the time of arrival  or birth weight. He also declined to say whether it was a premature birth or whether the delivery was a medical emergency. The couple have not yet released a name but bookmakers were taking the most bets on Thomas  George  Winston  Wilfred  Alexander  James and Matthew. The birth was announced shortly before 10am on Wednesday by a spokeswoman for the couple. She said: “The prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well. “The PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team.” Politicians across the spectrum offered their congratulations. Starmer offered his congratulations to Johnson and Symonds on Twitter  calling the announcement “wonderful news”. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  tweeted that he was “thrilled” for the couple. “Wonderful to have a moment of unalloyed joy!” he said. The Queen also sent a private message of good wishes to Johnson and Symonds to congratulate them  Buckingham Palace said. The monarch and the prime minister later spoke on Wednesday evening for their weekly audience. The prime minister’s father  Stanley Johnson  said he was “absolutely delighted” and “thrilled” by the birth of his grandson. David Cameron  who was in Downing Street while Johnson was mayor of London  sent his “heartfelt congratulations”  adding: “Sorry we didn’t leave the cot – but the climbing frame should still be in the garden!” Symonds  32  used to work as the Conservative party’s head of communications but now focuses on environmental and marine conservation issues. She moved into Downing Street with Johnson when he became prime minister and they are the first unmarried couple to live there. The couple’s new son follows a recent tradition of babies in No 10 with David Cameron’s wife  Samantha  giving birth to their daughter Florence in 2010  and Cherie Blair giving birth to the Blairs’ fourth child  Leo  in 2000. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa60b78f841d38918ee47df0cf9bf77becbd456/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74e3befe21a81882aba30cf28ae40145 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d8671f79a237b36a5ecf6ab958b425291e5af/288_163_3383_2030/master/3383.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7fe27f63807fb338db64dd93a9151b1 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093101ece8ed3bcccfd1f6fbca0a0105ea22b8e1/0_390_2615_1570/master/2615.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc091e2e0464e941b6f8585c2fb0ab5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4a656ca873623c8005f9eb8963c9908b6bab6b/0_66_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40ad26fb2fcdbae6122a50cfdb903cda https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39908a12421d2083a1c57d00e3b17ed3229f398/0_36_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe6464eebd737ec95fab3dc2ef8c0401 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCarrie+Symonds%2CUK+news%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/starmer-kills-raab-with-kindness-in-pmqs,politics, Sub Dom hankers for Daddy as Keir kills him with kindness, Raab  the country solicitor stand-in  was again at the mercy of the top QC’s mastery of his brief, Fair to say that the arrival of the latest baby boy caught everyone on the hop  as the official due date had been given as early summer less than a couple of months ago. Even Downing Street seemed wrongfooted by the news  having spent most of Tuesday afternoon and half of Wednesday morning refusing to say whether Boris was sufficiently recovered from his illness to take prime minister’s questions. A straightforward  “Carrie’s having the baby” would have been more than enough for most hacks. As it was  the birth took place amid levels of secrecy not even granted to the royal family. Just a short announcement that the mother and baby were both healthy and that Boris had been present throughout the birth. However  paternity leave may have to be put on hold indefinitely while the government tries to make a better fist of dealing with the pandemic than it has so far. So  after the obligatory expressions of good wishes towards Boris and Carrie  PMQs turned into a re-run of last week’s encounter between the Labour leader  Keir Starmer  and the stand-in prime minister  Dominic Raab. With much the same result as last time. As you would expect when a top QC finds himself up against a rather out-of-his-depth country conveyancing solicitor. Starmer doesn’t just beat his opponents with his forensic intelligence – it’s always helpful to have a party leader who can hold more than one thought in his head at any one time – but with politeness. The nicer he is being to you  the more trouble you know you are in. Even a shouty  ranty Keir might have been difficult for Raab to see off  given the government’s record on handling the coronavirus. But against a Keir who is the epitome of icy calm with the total mastery of his brief  he had no chance. First up  Dom was asked to explain Boris’s use of the phrase “our apparent success” in his return to Downing Street statement on Monday. Our mortality rates had already cruised past the chief scientific adviser’s hoped-for maximum of 20 000 deaths and the UK was still in lockdown from the first wave of the disease. By what criteria could that be judged an apparent success? A bead of sweat formed on Raab’s forehead. It was bad enough having to deal with his own fuck-ups  let alone those made by his boss. So he just mumbled something about how things could have been worse – hell  we could all have died – and then made the classic error of insisting it was far too early to make international comparisons. If the UK had the death rates per head of population of Germany and South Korea we would be shouting about it from the rooftops on a daily basis. And rightly so. From there on  Dom was firmly on the back foot as time and again Keir killed him with kindness. Starmer so  so wanted to be supportive in a time of crisis but he was just struggling with one or two little things. Like why the differential between testing capacity and demand  when there so clearly was excess demand. No  he wasn’t trying to score political points  he was merely echoing the concerns of the head of the Royal College of Physicians. And while he had Raab’s attention  could he just follow the lead of almost every other country and give a hint – a little hintlet even – of what the government’s exit strategy might be? Dom couldn’t. This was all well above his pay grade. He shouldn’t be carrying the can for all this. Next time Boris had a child someone else could take over. Things didn’t much improve when the SNP’s Ian Blackford wondered why the Conservatives were so dead set on leaving the EU at the end of the year at a time when the economy might have tanked completely? Even Raab could see it was a completely ludicrous idea and his face crumpled. Normally at times of stress  Dom merely goes full  mainlined-steroids psycho. Determined to out-macho and out-anger his opponents. Now there was something almost childlike about him as his carapace cracked. His vulnerability was almost painful to watch. He had done his best  but it hadn’t been nearly good enough. He was the little boy  out of his depth  who just wanted his Daddy. It was just unfortunate that his Daddy was off with his latest son. His only light relief was two questions about garden centres. Who knew the National Union for Garden Centres was so well represented on the Tory benches? , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c643d59682a6e0240e07340ba6dfe60b2bbfd3/0_289_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d71894e6bfd218f3f243c4d2c7e887a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Dominic+Raab%2CKeir+Starmer%2CPMQs%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/carrie-symonds-a-media-savvy-history-maker-in-no-10,uk-news, Carrie Symonds: a media-savvy history-maker in No 10, The PM’s partner has been on one emotional rollercoaster  and now faces another, From that day on 9 March to Wednesday’s surprise announcement that she had safely given birth to a “healthy baby boy”  the 32-year-old fiancee of the prime minister has endured an extraordinarily stressful time. Separated from Johnson after he tested positive for Covid-19  she developed symptoms herself. She was self-isolating  with only their jack russell  Dilyn  for company  as he was taken to hospital. And  as he struggled in intensive care  she could do nothing except send texts and scans of their unborn son  willing him the strength to recover. Reunited at Chequers on Johnson’s discharge from hospital on 12 April  the couple had been back at their Downing Street flat for just three days before the birth. By any standards  it has been an emotional rollercoaster ride  and one which she will undoubtedly need time to process. So it would be surprising to see much of Symonds in the near future. But then  she has kept a pretty low profile since she made news of her engagement and pregnancy public  posting on Instagram on 29 February: “Many of you already know but for my friends that still don’t  we got engaged at the end of last year … and we’ve got a baby hatching early summer. Feeling incredibly blessed.” Alongside was a photograph of her smiling  and Johnson kissing her cheek. It was an unprecedented post  by a woman who has made history as the first unmarried partner of a prime minster to live in Downing Street officially in recent times. The former Conservative HQ press officer  who rose to become communications chief  is seen as an incredible asset to Johnson. She is recognisable to young voters and her relationship with Johnson helps validate him among Tory millennials “hugely  absolutely” according to Sonia Purnell  the author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition. Johnson’s 25-year marriage to Marina Wheeler collapsed in 2018. His relationship with Symonds was reported in early 2019. “She really has boosted his brand. Extraordinarily so ” said Purnell. Her influence is said to extend from smartening up Johnson’s shambolic appearance  to augmenting the Conservative party’s green appeal. Michael Gove is among those to have realised her “green potential”. She is no political ingenue. She has been steeped in Conservative party politics since joining as a press officer on graduating from Warwick University with a first in history of art and theatre studies. Though a Brexiter  her views are said to lie more with the progressive wing of the party. She is described as “socially liberal  greenish  economically to the right”. She has worked as adviser to John Whittingdale at the culture department  to Sajid Javid at the Home Office  and to the former Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. She first worked with Johnson in 2012 on his successful second London mayoral campaign. Her 30th birthday party two years ago was attended by heavyweights including Johnson  Javid and Gove. It came shortly after she and Johnson had been seen lunching on Valentine’s Day at Rules  in Covent Garden. With rumours swirling  their status as an item appeared confirmed when they were photographed exchanging glances outside a Tory fundraising ball. She had  by then  left Conservative HQ to take up campaigning for Oceana  an eco-charity. She has been photographed with Johnson’s father  Stanley  at an anti-whaling protest. “I think she’s unbelievably ambitious ” said Purnell  who said Symonds divided opinion. “Some think she’s fun  she’s great  she’s introduced the whole green thing to a very dusty Tory agenda. She’s obviously clever and amusing. But a lot of really serious green people say she’s very good on cuddly  cute animals  but less so on tough decisions needed to make an impact on the economy  which she tends to shy away from.” The daughter of Matthew Symonds  the co-founder of the Independent  and Josephine Mcaffee  a lawyer at the same newspaper  she was educated at the prestigious west London school Godolphin and Latymer. She is well versed in the communications business  probably more so than her immediate female predecessors in No 10  Samantha Cameron  Sarah Brown and Cherie Blair. She was just 29 when she was appointed as Conservative communications chief. She was once ranked the second most powerful public relations operator in Britain by the trade magazine PR Week. She has an artful mastery of social media. At a time when she was the subject of unwelcome media coverage in the fallout from Johnson’s marriage break-up  she took to Instagram  posting: “Sea otters have the thickest fur of all animals.” Some have interpreted the message as evidence of her resilience. Since her relationship with Johnson became public  Symonds has darkened her hair  dressed more modestly than in her more youthful social media pictures  and attempted to keep a low profile  mostly successfully. One exception was when neighbours called police to the flat the couple shared after hearing her shout “get off me” and “get out of my flat”  during what transpired to be a noisy domestic row. When Johnson first got the keys to No 10  she stood alongside the rest of the Downing Street staff  though highly visible in a vibrant red and pink floral dress. After his December election victory  it was two months before she was seen by the press again  and then only leaving Downing Street by the back door. On 8 March  the couple were photographed in the stands at a Six Nations match at Twickenham. Today  as the preoccupied mother of a newborn  she is again likely to remain largely out of sight. With the prime minister expected to delay paternity leave due to the coronavirus crisis  new motherhood is likely to be another  entirely different  emotional rollercoaster ride. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a83fbfe08248afc52407de80fdd38447198ebb1b/0_80_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=afe0809fa773e5c3aa07ae9fb0ce811e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d97db5827d2181084fb9a86aa0f9c0c0c988b9d/0_177_4701_2821/master/4701.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b57d844ae661be30f5cb14aa971eae2 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Carrie+Symonds%2CUK+news%2CBoris+Johnson%2CConservatives%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/johnsons-baby-rounds-off-an-extraordinary-four-months-in-office,politics, Johnson's baby marks new chapter in PM's very public private life, After a tumultuous four months  the PM enters a familiar Downing Street balancing act, If things had gone a different way in St Thomas’ hospital  to use Johnson’s own phrase  he would indeed have died in public office  probably the most famous of the 218 000 victims of coronavirus worldwide. Now a month later  and possibly many weeks before he or his fiancee Carrie Symonds had expected  he was rushed back to hospital  but to see the delivery of his child. Symonds is herself only just recovering from the same virus. No date can yet be set for their summer wedding  the first involving a serving prime minister since 1822  as no date has been set by the prime minister to allow large gatherings to go ahead. If all this seems like an overblown episode of a very modern family soap opera  and somewhat distracting in the midst of the biggest shock to the British economy since the second world war  do not forget that the final terms of his disputed divorce settlement with Marina Wheeler have only just been sorted. The bruised emotions of his children from previous relationships also need tending to. Many previous prime ministers have had overcrowded messy private lives  but rarely has the professional and personal plate of a British prime minister been piled so high. This is match  hatch and near dispatch on steroids. But it is not as if Downing Street has not in the recent past coped with the tiny patter of prime ministerial offspring. A consequence of the youthfulness of contemporary British politicians is that three of the four most recent prime ministers  Tony Blair  Gordon Brown and David Cameron  all had young children bouncing in the Downing Street rose garden. Blair arrived in No 10 with three children already in tow  and an established skill at using his family to project an image of modern masculinity. In Parent magazine in 1996  one of innumerable such personal interviews  the strapline read: “Being a dad is harder than being a politician.” When he discovered in office that his wife  Cherie  was pregnant for a fourth time  Blair’s reaction  according to his communications adviser Alastair Campbell  was a mixture of horror  pleasure and disbelief. “Thank God  I am Christian. It allows me to think there is a reason ” he told Campbell. When the newspapers were told Blair was to be a father and this was the first baby born to a serving prime minister since Lord John Russell in 1849  “money could not buy the publicity we are getting”  Campbell gushed. Campbell had been worried the news would be greeted with cynicism  or even alarm at the potential distraction. On the day of Leo’s birth  Blair appeared on the steps of Downing Street with a mug decorated with a picture of his older children. But he also reassured an adjusting public that he would get his work-life priorities right. “I would be kidding you if I was to say: ‘for x period of time I’m not going to pick up the phone  I’m not going to talk to anyone  if there’s a crisis in the country or the world that I’m not going to be interested. That’s ridiculous. You can’t do that in my job. The important thing is to help Cherie and the baby. I will  obviously  try as much as possible to cut down in that period what I’m doing. But I have to run the country. That still has to go on.” Those who know him best say one of Blair’s special skills is his ability to compartmentalise. One minute he is negotiating the resignation of a Welsh secretary caught in a sex scandal  the next he is gladhanding at a diplomatic reception  and then he is upstairs in the flat discussing his children’s biology homework. The great aspiration is normality. Protecting the children physically from the media is merely a matter taking them out the back to school. It requires passing a few offices  but is hardly intrusive. Protecting them mentally is harder. By contrast Gordon Brown  who in the Treasury had introduced two weeks’ paid paternity leave and became a father at the age of 50  was reluctant to merge his public persona and private life. That is in part a function of tragedy: his first child  Jennifer  died 10 days after birth. But Treasury civil servants remember a happy integration in private  as they stepped over wooden train tracks in his flat discussing the go-ahead for high-speed rail. The more Brown’s spin doctors sought to deploy his family life to humanise his dour image  the more determined he became to protect his children’s privacy. Notoriously driven  private and dissatisfied  Brown just found it near impossible to switch off work  and never warmed to celebrity modern fatherhood. If he mentioned fatherhood in often torturous personal interviews it was often to mention his own father. Reflecting on what parenting had done to him seemed a painful act of sharing. It was a Conservative  David Cameron  who perfected the image of modern fatherhood inside No 10. At his first Tory conference as leader in 2006  his heavily pregnant wife appeared on stage with him as he patted her stomach. Later  three months after forming a coalition government in 2010  his daughter Florence was born. Cameron never shied away from talking about the influence of his children  including in his speeches  and  without displaying them  never hid them away  allowing them to attend middle-rank receptions  and doing his best to integrate them into an all-consuming life. On a book tour for his memoir  For the Record  Cameron said Florence  who was only five when the family left Downing Street in 2016  had hardly been scarred by the glare of life in No 10. He told the Cheltenham literature festival that his daughter had asked him only last summer: “Daddy  is it true  were you actually the prime minister?” If Johnson’s latest offspring can end his period in No 10 as ignorant of his father’s occupation  he  and his parents will have done well. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d8671f79a237b36a5ecf6ab958b425291e5af/70_64_3698_2219/master/3698.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b76d8d4f40cf2811b5ce61931916ade https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a6b9b7ae3088d543af0f718bcbb95c1f42efb9/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5edc1e92724405d1daf7ab1d659b020d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459f9a8cf1aa984abdaf0d0a950858f1a08b2249/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6cf9fc4e1106c4dbfb53ba4caa641d37 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97082cbae6e0dc7d44483fdb22eedeb4c6dd90a/0_40_2243_1345/master/2243.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bce0b17081b4b76969da9a1c1dac91ee https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e54a43a0b011b2d83edebc3725aa9d4115fa339/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42e173d1ca23966d36550fa6735e2345 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093101ece8ed3bcccfd1f6fbca0a0105ea22b8e1/0_390_2615_1570/master/2615.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc091e2e0464e941b6f8585c2fb0ab5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4a656ca873623c8005f9eb8963c9908b6bab6b/0_66_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40ad26fb2fcdbae6122a50cfdb903cda https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa60b78f841d38918ee47df0cf9bf77becbd456/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74e3befe21a81882aba30cf28ae40145 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39908a12421d2083a1c57d00e3b17ed3229f398/0_36_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe6464eebd737ec95fab3dc2ef8c0401 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCarrie+Symonds%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CConservatives%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBrexit%2CDavid+Cameron%2CTony+Blair%2CGordon+Brown%2CFamily https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/study-finds-a-third-of-uk-covid-19-patients-taken-to-hospital-are-dying,uk-news, Third of UK Covid-19 patients taken to hospital die  study finds, Authors of the study said the observed death rates put the illness on a par with Ebola, The study tracked the outcomes of nearly 17 000 patients – around one-third of all those admitted to hospital in the UK – and found that 33% had died  49% were discharged and 17% were still receiving treatment after two weeks. The figures present a stark picture of outcomes for those whose illness escalates to the point of needing medical help. “Some people persist in believing that Covid-19 is no worse than a bad dose of flu. They are gravely mistaken ” said Calum Semple  professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool  and chief investigator of the study. “Despite the best supportive care that we can provide  the crude case fatality rate for people who are admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 is 35% to 40% which is similar to that for people admitted to hospital with Ebola.” The average Ebola case fatality rate is around 50%  according to the World Health Organization  although case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. “People need to hear this and get it into their heads ” Semple added. “The reason the government is keen to keep people to stay at home until the outbreak is quietening down is because this is an incredibly dangerous disease.” Peter Openshaw  professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London  and co-lead of the study  said: “Those are extraordinarily sobering figures. All those hard data glosses over the human tragedy that each of those cases represents.” The study  published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed  found that of those admitted to hospital  17% ended up going into intensive care units (ICUs). Of these  45% died and for those receiving mechanical ventilation  the death rate rose to 53%  with 27% remaining in hospital when their outcome was recorded. For those on hospital wards  the fatality rate was 31%. The authors said that many patients are not transferred to ICU for more intensive interventions because this would be the wrong clinical decision  not due to bed shortages. “ICU is not something where the sickest patients all come to die ” said Dr Annemarie Docherty  a consultant in critical care and researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “We have specific tools like ventilation  renal support for kidneys  that we can deliver while people get better. For Covid  all we can offer is organ support while people are getting better. For a large number of people in hospital this is just not appropriate and people are unlikely to improve with these interventions.” The study also revealed more about which groups are most vulnerable  with men being more likely to be admitted to ICU and more likely to die  with differences becoming more striking in older age groups. The most significant health risk factor was obesity  increasing risk of death by 37% – a greater amount than heart disease (31%)  lung disease (19%) or kidney disease (25%). The link to obesity could be due to the condition typically causing related problems in the lungs and kidneys and because fat cells increase the body’s inflammatory state. “Nobody who is a big person is a big person in isolation ” said Semple  adding that obesity is also strongly associated with socio-economic status. “Together that makes it a very tough ride for these people when they catch Covid ” he said. Semple said the findings could influence who the government identifies as high risk for shielding policies as the lockdown is lifted and that the team is developing an interactive tool that will allow people to get a better sense of their own risk  based on sex  age and co-morbidities. The study was carried out by a consortium of researchers across more than 160 hospitals  which has now recruited 25 000 patients  and taken biological samples from 1 000 of them  making it the largest study in Europe on outcomes and risk factors. The team is also looking closely at why a disproportionate number of admissions and deaths are seen in black people and those from south-east Asian backgrounds. Semple said that crucial lessons could be learnt from how the Ebola epidemic was brought under control. “Key to eradicating Ebola was the provision of same-day or next-morning reporting of test results which allowed proper isolation of cases and rapid release from confinement for suspected cases ” he said. “It will be the same for Covid-19. We need widespread rapid access to same-day or next-morning test results to keep Covid-19 at bay which in turn will allow our society and economy to regain function.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a806bc36be813ad3ebd7e8be1fe8e0f7e6dd19cd/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae4600dea7e73e7f5c7825f572e18a9b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CEbola%2CMedical+research%2CHospitals https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/hospital-investigates-death-of-nhs-doctor-peter-tun-who-pleaded-for-ppe,world, Hospital investigates death of NHS doctor who pleaded for PPE, Exclusive: Royal Berkshire trust launches serious incident inquiry into death of Peter Tun, The Royal Berkshire NHS trust has begun a serious incident investigation after Dr Peter Tun  who specialised in helping patients with brain conditions recover  died on 13 April. Using emails shared by his son Michael  the Guardian revealed last week how Tun asked managers at the hospital in Reading on 23 March to ensure he and his team had personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of being infected with coronavirus. His appeals were rebuffed because he did not have any suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 on his unit. His death has generated substantial publicity with both Tun’s brother Ye Myint – an NHS consultant – and Michael criticising the trust’s failure to provide PPE  amid a dispute over whether it was correctly applying the guidance on protective kit. Michael said last week: “When a doctor of 40 years’ experience has had to literally beg for surgical masks  and it is denied  something has gone seriously wrong. I think that my dad’s death was avoidable and that that probability would have been reduced if he had had proper personal protective equipment.” The inquiry is being undertaken by a group of senior doctors and managers at the Reading hospital  which has informed the family of the investigation and offered its condolences. A spokesperson for the trust said: “We can confirm a serious incident investigation has been launched. It involves senior managers and clinicians who are working closely with Dr Tun’s family to look at their concerns and answer their questions. Whilst this is ongoing  we are unable to say any more.” A source at the hospital said: “We need to get to the bottom of this. Peter was the first member of staff that we have lost. That  plus the nature of his death  means it’s important to do this properly  so that his family get what they need to hear.” However  it is unclear whether the investigation will look at the availability of PPE within the hospital or just the trust’s application of Public Health England’s (PHE) guidelines on PPE at the time Tun sent the emails. They were strengthened soon after. One member of staff with knowledge of the inquiry said: “It will look at the guidance around PPE at the time. But it won’t look at the supply of PPE in the trust at the time.” The trust is also considering whether it may have to report Tun’s death to the Health and Safety Executive to look into whether it involved any breaches of an employer’s duty to protect their staff. An official from the office of the coroner for Berkshire has also contacted Michael Tun  raising the possibility that the events surrounding the death will be explored in a public forum. Dr Claudia Paoloni  the president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association  said: “It’s very sad that Dr Tun has died after requesting PPE. It highlights the need for all healthcare workers in all healthcare settings to have PPE at all times  to keep healthcare workers safe. “At the time Dr Tun sent his emails  various medical royal colleges and the HCSA were raising concerns with PHE about the weaknesses with its guidance on PPE.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d1473cf7ab8126fc2a0bfd6e766d3519d05d15/0_299_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8055960a0f77b039e09b6aa2f2dacfee https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CSociety%2CHealth%2CUK+news%2CHospitals%2CDoctors https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/29/government-rushes-out-request-for-experts-bolster-sage-panel,science, Government rushes out request for experts to work with Sage panel, Notice sent to universities amid concern over lack of expertise in parts of Covid-19 advisory group, Researchers at British universities received requests on Wednesday morning to work with the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) international and behavioural teams and were asked to declare their interest by the end of Thursday. The experts will not formally join Sage  but will collaborate with them. A notice sent to academics said the Government Office for Science was playing a central role in the UK’s response to the epidemic through Sage  the group led by the chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  and that “they are now looking for additional expert support”. The move comes amid intense scrutiny of the group  whose membership is traditionally kept secret until the emergency being worked on has passed. Since the Guardian revealed the names of two dozen Sage participants last week  critics have raised concerns about the apparent lack of expertise in a number of areas  notably frontline public health epidemiologists  emergency response specialists and logisticians. The membership of Sage has been thrust into the spotlight amid concerns that ministers have failed in key areas of Britain’s response to coronavirus  from acting too slowly  lagging behind on testing  and having insufficient supplies of personal protective equipment  all while insisting they were following “the best science”. The presence at Sage meetings of Dominic Cummings  the prime minister’s chief political adviser  has fuelled further questions about the scientific advice No 10 is receiving. Sir David King  a former chief scientific adviser  warned that Cummings’s participation in the meetings was problematic as he would relay his interpretation of the discussions directly to Boris Johnson. On Monday  Scotland’s first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  complained of a “deficiency” in the system for providing scientific advice  saying she was unhappy that the chief scientist for the Scottish government did not have full participation in Sage meetings. Vallance said earlier this week the Sage advisers and those on its subgroups would be named “shortly” unless individuals objected. The documents Sage has reviewed during its meetings will also be published as soon as permission from the relevant authors had been granted  he added. Academics will work with the advisory groups for an initial three-month secondment and spend their time supporting expert meetings  tracking and summarising key research and scientific developments  and liaising with a wide range of experts to understand the latest picture on the virus. One advert calls for researchers to assist the international group of Sage’s Covid-19 response team. The advert casts a wide net  seeking experts in global public health  health systems  epidemiology  infectious diseases  emerging diseases  and social or behavioural sciences. The second advert calls for experts to support the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours  or SPI-B  a subgroup of the Sage Covid-19 response team. The specialisms being sought are behavioural psychology  health psychology  behaviour change and behavioural economic. Duties will range from turning the group’s discussions into consensus statements and performing research  for example  on public perceptions and likely responses to policy decisions  according to the advert. A Government Office for Science spokesperson said: “Scientists working with the Government Office for Science are playing an integral and continued role in the UK’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “As this advert makes clear  we are continuing to expand our deep and diverse pool of expertise with secondments available to the best and brightest academics. These roles will form part of the GO-Science team and are do not relate to expert participants of the Sage committee.” • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK? , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3eb0c345a214a126d04fcc528a547fd800e213/0_104_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=260ee23ac25ce88194c4e27fb405cafd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Medical+research%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CScience%2CHealth%2CHealth+policy%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages,society, NHS staff coronavirus inquests told not to look at PPE shortages, Exclusive: guidance to avoid examining systemic failures is ‘very worrying’  says Labour, The chief coroner for England and Wales  Mark Lucraft QC  has issued guidance that “an inquest would not be a satisfactory means of deciding whether adequate general policies and arrangements were in place for provision of PPE to healthcare workers”. Lucraft said that “if there were reason to suspect that some human failure contributed to the person being infected with the virus”  an inquest may be required. The coroner “may need to consider whether any failures of precautions in a particular workplace caused the deceased to contract the virus and so contributed to death”. But he added: “An inquest is not the right forum for addressing concerns about high-level government or public policy.” Labour warned the advice could limit the scope of investigations into the impact of PPE shortages on frontline staff who have died from Covid-19  including 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff  according to government figures  though these are believed to be an underestimate. “I am very worried that an impression is being given that coroners will never investigate whether a failure to provide PPE led to the death of a key worker ” said Lord Falconer  the shadow attorney general. “This guidance may have an unduly restricting effect on the width of inquests arising out of Covid-19-related deaths.” Doctors and nurses’ unions have repeatedly warned that their members do not feel safe at work because of a lack of PPE. Three weeks before he died  a Reading doctor  Peter Tun  warned Royal Berkshire hospital that unless it supplied vital protective kit “it will be too little and too late”. A coroner has been in touch with his family but it remains unclear whether there will be an inquest. The hospital has begun a serious incident investigation into the death  the Guardian has learned. Rinesh Parmar  the chair of the Doctors Association UK  said: “The provision of PPE is so vital to the safety of health workers that to suggest coroners do not consider its supply in detail misses a big part of the picture. Only comprehensive inquests into the deaths of every NHS and care worker will give the bereaved the ability to ask questions and have the circumstances of their loved ones’ deaths fully explained.” Explaining his newly issued advice  Lucraft cited a court ruling that found it was right for an inquest to consider whether a soldier had died because a flak jacket had been pierced by a sniper’s bullet  but not to consider whether more effective flak jackets could and should have been supplied by the Ministry of Defence. However  coroners have in the past ruled on the provision of protective equipment. When the Oxfordshire assistant deputy coroner Andrew Walker investigated the death of Steve Roberts  a tank commander who died in Iraq when he was not supplied with enhanced body armour  he concluded that the lack of appropriate basic equipment was “unforgivable and inexcusable and represents a breach of trust that those soldiers have in the government”. A spokesman for the chief coroner at the Judicial Office said the guidance was “an expression of the law as it currently stands” and “to provide consistency for coroners”. About half of doctors working in high-risk areas told a British Medical Association survey this month there were shortages or no supply at all of long-sleeved disposable gowns and disposable goggles  while 56% said the same for full-face visors. Supplies of PPE to care workers remain patchy and a promised government supply system  known as Clipper  is yet to get properly up and running. With no public inquiry into the coronavirus crisis yet established  inquests remain the only official forum to investigate deaths. Daniel Machover  one of the UK’s leading inquest lawyers  said the guidance could be subject to judicial review by lawyers acting for bereaved families. “This points to the need for a public inquiry ” he said. “As you widen out the issue from one death to several deaths you get into a situation where an inquest format is not suitable and you want to be dealing with systemic issues.” Deborah Coles  the director of Inquest  a charity which advises on investigations into state-related deaths  said: “Bereaved families legitimately ask whether failures in the provision of safety equipment played a part in the deaths of their loved ones. “It follows that coroners should  where appropriate  examine this question. In the absence of a public inquiry inquests will play a vital role in identifying systemic failings in the protection of frontline workers. This scrutiny is key to learning lessons and holding people to account in order to prevent future deaths.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cdf52945c8ddc2e4c347a327cee13944c1c95d0/0_91_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5475f87806d259bde9c11aec31189af3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a13288f06f9b79b92c88f0fd9d5d907363a58ee/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a82050edb0b80a9dea6ff3bd7dd1ffa9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis,world, Revealed: the inside story of the UK's Covid-19 crisis, How herd immunity and delayed lockdown hampered efforts to contain the spread of coronavirusby David Conn  Felicity Lawrence  Paul Lewis  Severin Carrell  David Pegg  Harry Davies and Rob Evans, Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie  frightening week after Monday 16 March  when Boris Johnson’s government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach  which had envisaged 60% of the population – 40 million people – would become infected  and while many would die  the majority would recover and attain “herd immunity”. That week  although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson  normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs  restaurants and gyms stayed open  as did schools  until Friday 20 March. Sazuze  who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself  says he “never liked that herd immunity idea”. “During those weeks  the virus was allowed to spread ” he says. “We have suffered such a painful blow. I strongly believe that if the government had acted more quickly we wouldn’t have lost so many lives  and my wife could be here today.” The health secretary  Matt Hancock  supported by Downing Street  has persistently denied that attaining herd immunity  by allowing the disease to infect most people  was ever a policy  goal  strategy or even “part of the plan”. Well-placed government sources said on the strictest reading of the word “policy” that may be true. But they do not understand how the government can claim that herd immunity was not part of its plan. The Guardian’s account of the government’s response to the crisis is based on interviews with sources in or close to Downing Street  the Department of Health and Social Care  the Cabinet Office  Cobra and Sage  as well as other advisers and experts. Many asked not to be named  because they were not authorised to speak publicly. Some said that while they had concerns  they were holding back some of their criticism because they did not want to damage public trust in government at such a delicate time. All are wary of being wise in hindsight  and sympathetic to ministers who took decisions they felt were right at the time. But with Covid-19 having spread virulently  particularly during those first three weeks of March  more than 21 000 people have now died in hospitals alone and Britain is predicted to be possibly the worst affected country in Europe. There are profound questions to be answered  about why Johnson’s government stood alone among the countries of the world  pursuing that herd immunity approach  and why  when they realised stricter measures were needed  the lockdown was still delayed. Prof Neil Ferguson  the lead scientist on the Covid-19 response team at Imperial College London  whose advice paper of 16 March is credited with convincing the government to change course  responded extensively to questions from the Guardian for this article. He emphasised that one alarming estimate in that paper was not new: that under the “mitigation scenario”  which apparently envisaged herd immunity as one outcome  and included measures then being considered by the government  250 000 people would die. Viewed from today’s unimaginably changed perspective  this year’s pre-crisis months can seem like a parallel world. Johnson’s media backers were feting him then for winning the “Get Brexit Done” election  and his private life  since criticised by some as a distraction  was portrayed as a cause for national rejoicing when on 29 February he and Carrie Symonds announced their engagement. Johnson took Britain out of the European Union on 31 January  portraying the moment as an opportunity to “unleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.” A day earlier  an emergency committee of the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19  which had broken out in China and spread to 18 countries  was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The WHO stated then  as it has emphasised throughout  that this highest state of alert required an immediate response. In the absence of a vaccine  the WHO insisted that the virus should be addressed like the operation mounted in South Korea  with extensive testing  tracing people with whom a person testing positive has had close contact  and isolating all of them  “to interrupt virus spread”. David Nabarro  the WHO Covid-19 envoy  told the Guardian that he and the director general  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  knew then that the coronavirus was going to become “huge” and would be “really difficult” for governments. “Coronaviruses are horrible ” Nabarro said. “They’re rather stable and incredibly well designed to wreak havoc among populations because they are very  very easy to transmit and quite tough to contain. You can’t just let this thing go  and let it wash over your society  because it will kill lots of old people  and a few younger people  it will make hospitals into a big mess  and it will endanger health workers.” On 3 February  Johnson made another triumphal Brexit speech  in which he even sounded a note against responding too strongly to Covid-19  arguing it ran counter to his vision of Britain as a “supercharged champion” of global free trade. He was labelled a “part-time prime minister” by the Labour opposition on 28 February  after he spent 12 days away at the Chevening country residence in Kent  and did not attend four of the first five meetings of the Cobra committee  convened to consider Britain’s response to Covid-19  until one on Monday 2 March. He did go to a meeting in late February  attended by senior officials  but only very briefly  without making a substantial contribution  which one attendee says seemed strange. Asked about this  a Downing Street spokesperson clarified that Johnson went to be updated on coronavirus  and left after that. The government’s decision-making on Covid-19 has since become a focus of fierce scrutiny and much criticism  partly for its lack of transparency. Cobra  the forum for considering emergencies  attended by ministers and their officials  meets in secret. It takes scientific advice from Sage  whose membership was not made public until the Guardian revealed the names of participants. They included Johnson’s chief of staff  Dominic Cummings  and another Downing Street adviser  Ben Warner  a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign  and is said by one Sage attendee to have “behaved as Cummings’ deputy”. Supposed to be impartial and free from political influence  Sage responds to questions passed down from Cobra. Its own makeup has been criticised by some as too narrow  overly reliant on epidemiologists who specialise in mathematical modelling. One participant told the Guardian that Sage lacked diversity and was “way too slow” to consider how other countries  including those in south Asia  were managing to contain the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for Sir Patrick Vallance  the government’s chief scientific adviser  rejected those criticisms  saying the scientists are engaged with experts in other countries and “containment strategies form part of those discussions”. Sage receives advice from three expert groups: Nervtag  which examines the science of the virus itself; SPI-M  which models how it spreads; and SPI-B  which involves behavioural scientists in considering how people may respond to restrictive measures. Following initial criticism  the government has published some details  making public the Nervtag membership and minutes of meetings  and some limited papers from SPI-M and SPI-B. Yet even these few documents do establish that Covid-19’s catastrophic threat to life was communicated clearly to ministers by the scientific advisers. On 2 March  a brief “consensus statement” from SPI-M reported very stark assessments to Sage. “It is highly likely that there is sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present ” it said. The coronavirus was noted to be highly contagious  with each infected person infecting two to three more. If “stringent measures” were not imposed  “it would correspond to around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected”. SPI-M’s best estimate of the death rate was 0.5% to 1%: between 250 000 and 500 000 people. Of those requiring hospital treatment  12% were likely to die. If  like Elsie Sazuze  they needed to be put on a ventilator  they had only a 50% chance of survival. Yet somehow  the genuine peril and need to act fast was not seized on by the government. The first phase of a plan to contain the virus with testing and tracing was ended on 12 March  and the policy moved to try to delay the peak of the infection. Later  the plan was for “mitigation”  for a series of measures to be gradually brought in: “case isolation” of seven days for somebody who felt they had symptoms  then “household isolation” for everybody living with them to quarantine themselves for 14 days  then at some point  to shield elderly and vulnerable people. The day after the 2 March Cobra meeting and SPI-M statement  Johnson held the first televised press conference with Vallance and Chris Whitty  the chief medical officer. Whitty did say solemnly that a worst-case scenario estimated 80% of people could become infected  and 1% of those could die  but the message best remembered is Johnson joshingly telling the nation: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.” Johnson’s advice was: “We should all basically just go about our normal daily lives.” He also advised: “The best thing you can do is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.” Over the next fortnight  as Italy moved to impose a lockdown  France and Spain began to do the same  and Germany embarked on physical distancing measures coupled with Europe’s most extensive testing and contact tracing operation  Britain did comparatively little. Hand-washing was still the main advice  along with case isolation of people feeling symptoms. The first official report of somebody dying in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 caught in the UK came on 5 March. Still  elderly and vulnerable people were not given any advice to shield themselves. A member of one Sage advisory committee said that around this time there was a gap between the scientific advice and political messaging. “The prime minister was going around shaking people’s hands to demonstrate that there wasn’t a problem. There was a disconnect at that point. We were all slightly incredulous that that was happening.” Some experts believe Britain’s exceptional response arose in part because government preparations for a pandemic were so weighted to a flu outbreak. Prof Graham Medley  a Sage member and the chair of SPI-M – which stands for scientific pandemic influenza – modelling – explains. “Everything – government preparedness  the modelling – was based on pandemic influenza. And that’s not because of lack of awareness on our part  that’s because that got the government attention and the funding. We could persuade them that flu was important.” The group’s terms of reference were eventually broadened to include different kinds of pandemic but the emphasis lingered. Scientists are used to seeing flu spread through populations very fast  then become milder as it mutates  and to seeing people indeed develop immunity and populations become resistant. Covid-19 is lethally different  new  its properties more uncertain  and the idea of addressing it by allowing it to move through the population and attain herd immunity was widely condemned for risking far too many lives. Given the repeated denials  it can be overlooked that the reason the world believes that attaining herd immunity was the government’s approach is largely because Vallance said it was. On Friday 13 March  when the virus was spreading exponentially  he set out publicly to explain the government’s strategy. “Our aim is to try and reduce the peak  broaden the peak  not suppress it completely ” Vallance explained on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Also  because the vast majority of people get a mild illness  to build up some kind of herd immunity  so more people are immune to this disease  and we reduce the transmission. At the same time  we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.” Asked on Sky News what proportion of the population would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity  Vallance replied: “Probably about 60% or so.” Few mitigation measures were yet put in place. The week is remembered for the mega-events that went ahead: the Cheltenham Festival of horseracing  the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie  the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff. In allowing them  the government was indeed  as it consistently said  following the UK science that  surprisingly to many  considers that “mass gatherings” do not have a major impact on virus transmission. The numbers of people infected will almost certainly never be known  but the pictures of packed stands  particularly at Cheltenham  have become emblems of the government’s delay and inaction. On 11 March  the WHO formally declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Tedros  the director general  maintained that the virus spread could still be confronted  and criticised “alarming levels of inaction” by some countries. That same day  a further explanation of the government’s strategy was given by Dr David Halpern  a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team  a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office  which it advises. “There’s going to be a point  assuming the epidemic flows and grows  as we think it probably will do  where you’ll want to cocoon  you’ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don’t catch the disease  and by the time they come out of their cocooning  herd immunity’s been achieved in the rest of the population.” At a press conference the following day  Johnson famously said: “I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” Whitty announced then that the initial effort to contain the disease by testing and tracing had been abandoned  yet despite that  and Johnson’s dire warning  the measures discussed for the new “delay” phase were almost negligible. People over 70 were advised not to go on cruises. Johnson said even “household quarantine” would not be required until sometime “in the next few weeks”. The government’s published plan did say that social distancing and school closures could be considered. That evening  the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke on the BBC  saying he was concerned Britain had become an “outlier”. Hunt says now he became worried that Whitty was too resigned to the virus spreading: “I couldn’t understand why they were so certain that nothing could be done to stop nearly 60% of our population becoming infected  when I had figures showing that even in Wuhan  the centre of the outbreak in China  less than 1% of the population actually became infected.” Vallance made his media appearances the following day  explaining the herd immunity approach. He was asked on Sky News why in the UK “society was continuing as normal”  and it was put to him that a 60% infection rate would mean “an awful lot of people dying”. Vallance replied that it was difficult to estimate the number of deaths  but said: “Well of course we do face the prospect  as the prime minister said yesterday  of an increasing number of people dying.” Matt Hancock  the health secretary  issued the first denial that herd immunity was part of the government’s plan  despite Halpern and Vallance having days earlier indicated that it was  in a column in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 March. “We have a plan  based on the expertise of world-leading scientists ” Hancock wrote. “Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept  not a goal or a strategy.” By then  a dizzying number of experts were sounding the alarm. An open letter issued on 14 March dismissing herd immunity as “not a viable option” and calling for stricter social distancing measures so that “thousands of lives can be spared” was signed by more than 500 UK scientists. Ultimately  the evidence that appears to have prompted the change of course was contained in the Imperial College paper  published on 16 March. Ferguson’s paper has been greatly reported on but somewhat misunderstood. It did suddenly warn that the NHS would be overwhelmed “eight-fold”  resulting in “hundreds of thousands of deaths” if the government did not change its strategy from mitigation to “suppression”. But the reason was comparatively technical: experience in Italy and of the first UK cases had shown that double the number of intensive care beds was required than previously estimated. The paper sets out the measures that would apparently comprise a mitigation policy  which the government was then planning: “Case isolation  household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.” Ferguson made it clear to the Guardian that the estimate in that paper of 250 000 deaths was not new and was based on “the mitigation scenario”. The paper indicated that  in effect  the virus had to be allowed to spread initially  so that over time people would become infected  recover  and attain immunity: “Introducing such interventions too early risks allowing transmission [of the virus] to return once they are lifted (if insufficient herd immunity has developed).” Ferguson held a press conference on 16 March to explain the new findings. His colleague  Prof Azra Ghani  said: “Under strategies we were pursuing  we were expecting a degree of herd immunity to build up. If we now realise it’s not possible to cope with that in the current health system  and it may not be acceptable in terms of the numbers  then we need to try and reduce transmission.” The Guardian asked Ferguson how that policy could be contemplated  if it predicted that 250 000 people would die. He emphasised that he was never sanguine about people dying  and made it very clear that it was the politicians  not the scientists  who decided on policies to pursue. “While policy can be guided by scientific advice  that does not mean scientific advisers determine policy ” he said. “Though I do try to make it clear to policymakers what the potential consequences of different policies might be  to the extent the science allows.” Prof Graham Medley  another Sage member  and chair of its influential modelling subcommittee  agreed that while the scientists gave their analysis on the epidemic to inform the politicians  deciding what to do was “a political decision”. Medley told the Guardian that Johnson  Hancock and other ministers continually saying they have been guided by the scientists has “sometimes gone a bit past the mark”. Asked if he meant that the politicians were passing the buck  Medley replied: “Yes.” Even after the stark warning that the NHS would be overwhelmed if the policy did not change  Johnson and his government still hesitated. He made another speech that day in which he advised “drastic action” was now needed  but the measures were advisory and still tentative. People over 70  pregnant women  and those with some health conditions were advised only to “avoid all unnecessary social contact”. Britons were asked “where they possibly can” to work from home  and Johnson told them “you should avoid pubs  clubs  theatres and other such social venues”  although all were permitted to stay open. The delay to introducing stricter measures  until the lockdown was finally ordered on 23 March  appears to have been at least partly based on a flawed misreading of the government’s own scientific advice. In early March  Whitty mentioned the idea that the government should wait to impose restrictions because people might tire of them  later saying this was based on both “common sense” and “behavioural science”. “What we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do ” he said. “There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.” Hancock supported that  suggesting it was the result of official advice. “The evidence of past epidemics and past crises of this nature shows that people do tire of these sorts of social distancing measures  so if we start them too early  they lose their effect and actually it is worse ” he said. “The social science and the behavioural science are a very important part of the scientific advice that we rely on.” Yet this concept of “fatigue” was rejected by the behavioural scientists appointed by the government itself to Sage’s subcommittee  SPI–B. “The word was never used in any of our committee reports ” said Susan Michie  a SPI-B member. “It is just not a concept that exists in behavioural science  and it was unhelpful for it to be used.” Four other members of SPI-B also told the Guardian that the committee never advised that people would tire of restrictive measures. The publicly available summaries of their conclusions show the group advised that people should be given clear explanations and reasons for social distancing measures  and warn that those measures would affect people unequally  but nowhere do they suggest that people will become “fatigued”. Three behavioural scientists on SPI-B  Stephen Reicher  John Drury and Clifford Stott  even wrote an article for the Psychologist journal  rejecting the notion of “fatigue” and suggesting that delaying stricter social distancing measures on that premise was taking a risk with lives. “Psychological considerations were put at odds with what medical science demanded ” they wrote. The Guardian understands that Halpern’s Behavioural Insights Team  or “nudge unit”  was also opposed to this view that people would tire of restrictive measures. One senior Whitehall source said Whitty himself was the main advocate of the “fatigue” notion  based partly on his own experience of patients in medical practice who do not see drug prescriptions through to their completion. A Downing Street spokesperson  responding on behalf of Whitty  emphasised that he was indeed concerned about timing interventions  and their impact on people’s wellbeing if introduced too early  and that Sage had agreed a balance needed to be struck between the impact of measures  and the time the public could feasibly sustain them. During the week after 16 March  there was a fierce debate within government about whether a stricter lockdown needed to be imposed. “Several of us thought measures needed to be introduced earlier ” one source close to the Cabinet Office said. Hancock appears to have been under great pressure  stretched between that view and resistance elsewhere to taking genuinely drastic action. A senior source at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recalled discussions about the herd immunity policy continuing  despite Hancock having disowned it  and a senior official still advocating it. “His basic view was that we were all going to develop antibodies  and ultimately the question was how to manage the release of the disease into the population over time.” The health secretary is said by another well-placed source to have argued forcefully for a lockdown in one Cobra meeting  chaired by Michael Gove  with a junior treasury minister who was resisting due to its huge economic impact and worries that a lockdown would itself kill many people. The source said Hancock kept referring to the modelling that predicted deaths would surge dramatically without a lockdown. The DHSC source sums up this period soberly: “They knew we would have to go into lockdown; they were debating when. Every single day they wasted  every day we weren’t in lockdown  was resulting in people contracting the disease – people who have since died.” One source on Sage said there was also nervousness among their group that week  a feeling that the virus was getting out of control and they were not sure the politicians understood its exponential spread. The advice was being communicated  the source said  but they were told that Whitty and Vallance were having to cajole the politicians in the right direction  and there was “friction”. Reflecting on the presence at Sage of Cummings and Warner  some attendees now say the group’s deliberations were affected by a sense of what could feasibly be done  with a government run by politicians to whom a lockdown looked unthinkable  although others say they were not. Then  that week  when stricter measures were needed  some say it was useful to have Cummings there  because they knew he would communicate that directly to Johnson. One source in Downing Street who personally urged the prime minister to stop delaying and move into lockdown that week said his reticence was partly down to his “libertarian instinct”. “There was also a bit of ‘rabbit caught in headlights’.” Ken Sazuze remembers that week very well. He and Elsie  who grew up together in Malawi before he came to Britain and joined the army  were worried  he recalls  particularly about Elsie working without personal protective equipment suitable for Covid-19  and about the coronavirus spreading in Birmingham. She had moved last year from working in NHS hospitals to caring for people in nursing homes  so she could have more regular shifts and help Anna with her GCSEs. That week  Anna’s school was open  Andrew was travelling on public transport to Wolverhampton University  where he is in the third year of a finance degree. Ken was on a placement during the final year of his nursing degree  while Elsie was working. “It was still life as normal ” he says. “Everywhere was open. People weren’t social distancing; they didn’t know what to do. We went to the gym  to the shops  to uni  to the library.” On Wednesday 18 March  they went into Birmingham  to the Bullring  shopping for presents for Anna  whose 16th birthday was 10 days away. They went to Marks & Spencer looking for perfume  he remembers  and to an Apple store  where they bought her some AirPods. “We didn’t know we were infecting ourselves ” Ken says. “I am really annoyed when I start thinking about it too much. I am furious with the government  with people making decisions  that the virus was spreading at that time.” Given the incubation period of Covid-19  Boris Johnson may have contracted the virus that week too. The nation was given the highest profile demonstration of Covid-19’s destructive force  as the prime minister went into hospital days later  then into intensive care. While there was great sympathy for Johnson undergoing that personal ordeal  some experts have argued that the spectacle of Johnson  Cummings  Hancock  Whitty and other advisers contracting the virus indicated that the government was not taking social distancing seriously enough. One source in Downing Street the week before the lockdown said they were surprised to find staff at No 10 still shaking hands with visitors. A Downing Street spokesperson made clear they do not accept that Johnson should have been more careful  saying that No 10 did enforce social distancing where practical. On 23 March  the lockdown was finally imposed  Johnson clasping his hands during his televised address to the nation  telling people they must stay at home  to save lives and protect the NHS  and go out only for exercise and to shop for essentials. That week  apart from work  Sazuze says he and Elsie only went to Asda and Costco. But on Wednesday 25 March  Elsie began to feel unwell. The unthinkable happened very quickly. Three days later  at 2am  she was struggling with her breathing and had a very high temperature  so they called an ambulance which took her to hospital. By 2 April  Ken had a call with her  on FaceTime  before she was put on a ventilator. “That was my last goodbye with my wife ” he says. “We knew it was 50-50 if she went on the ventilator. She said: ‘Ken  I’ve prayed  I’ve talked to the doctor  I’m happy to do this. I love you  and if anything happens  you look after the children.’ I told her: “Honey  come on  let’s think positive; let’s not think you’re not going to pull through.’” They were called on 8 April at 1am and told to rush to the hospital. He laments that Anna was deemed too young to go into the intensive care unit  and had to be in touch with her and Andrew  by Elsie’s side  via FaceTime. “We were praying ” he says. “But there was no response.” That day  8 April  Elsie was among 938 people reported to have died in hospitals from Covid-19  as the catastrophe in Britain steepled  and so many families  including those of doctors  nurses  other NHS staff and key workers  were plunged into grief. In a response to questions about the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic  and whether Johnson regrets any elements of it  Downing Street did not accept any criticisms. A spokesperson replied in a statement: “This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it  guided by the best scientific advice. We are so grateful for the response of the public  who have helped us to slow the spread of the virus and stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus  delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal. We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs  made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it and taken unprecedented steps to support businesses and workers  to protect the economy.” The spokesperson for Vallance said: “Herd immunity was a scientific point  that ultimately immunity is an important way to tackle infectious disease  ideally through vaccination.” Ken Sazuze says he understood that this was an unprecedented pandemic  but could not understand how the government could say its response had been faultless. “I’m in a different world now ” he says  “it’s something you can’t believe. I am angry as well. It would help if they accept their mistakes and apologise. It was slow  the testing and PPE was not adequate  and this virus was allowed to spread. Sometimes you just have to stand up and admit your mistakes  as a human being.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e06455833e99500ac7444892897533d4979ee6db/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77aaa3a2790c069046bdfd76be15b470 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfbec52fe2b60312f5f87f832ea1848727717a3/28_225_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5828f83d392a8a9918feb7c031c1832d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc/0_434_6517_3911/master/6517.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c25145c7500d8df051c1039e4d9134b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048/0_211_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=362cc85627e6778492302d9ae0778d59 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49816b747a8b3331eb855f242f53b8cb6e0afc20/0_115_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=458113bde95c36264c34c6b4a4989fa2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f19e9999c03fdf7122b1f2a0208fb53279f9175/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d0ddeae2fbda14f0b021e3299df623f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b533fe0d3483449e7a91d766872021d58755ce4/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ad8d74023adea73b00ddeed86157b92 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0a1eab18566d58074eefc22ca0781e254b7e73/0_350_5437_3262/master/5437.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4bf6f3517b1b411f02c54667def26c86 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/714064e2c147c41f5cffff3703886e87a5b8decb/0_14_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=677d5833a5458158f438230cb25b031c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBoris+Johnson%2CDominic+Cummings%2CPatrick+Vallance%2CChris+Whitty%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-schools-across-england-reopen-phases-education-secretary-gavin-williamson,education, Schools across England will reopen in phases  says education secretary, Gavin Williamson did not say when closures due to coronavirus would end as he was grilled by select committee, The secretary of state would not give a date for reopening  but ruled out schools opening during the summer holidays as a way of helping pupils who have missed out on education to catch up. Questioned by the education select committee on Wednesday  Williamson told MPs: “We recognise that the idea of schools all returning on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical. “I do expect schools to be opened in a phased manner. I also intend to be giving schools as much notice as possible.” There has been continuing speculation about when schools might reopen  and whether older year groups  including pupils in their final year of primary school and those in the middle of GCSE and A-level courses could be among the first to be brought back into schools as they might benefit most. Asked which pupils might return first  the education secretary said the government was looking at best practice in other countries where schools are already beginning to reopen. He said a sub-group from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advising the government on its response to the pandemic had been set up to focus solely on issues surrounding school reopening. “It is incredibly important that we get the right balance in terms of actually making sure that we create an environment that is good to learn in but also that is a safe environment for people to both work in and learn in as well ” he told MPs. The education secretary faced persistent questioning about the impact of school closures on the most disadvantaged pupils from committee chair  Conservative MP Robert Halfon  who warned of a “potential cascade of mounting social injustice that could last a decade”. Only small numbers of children classed as vulnerable by the government have taken up school places kept open for them during the course of the coronavirus crisis  and research has suggested many children from disadvantaged backgrounds are accessing little if any online learning. Williamson said the government had put in £100m worth of investment in equipment and IT support for children disadvantaged by the digital divide. During the course of the hearing it emerged however that the promised 200 000 laptops would not start to arrive in schools until the end of next month  with the majority delivered in June. The government’s free school meal voucher scheme  set up to try to ensure that the poorest children do not go hungry during the crisis  also came in for sharp criticism from MPs who were concerned about long delays and “deeply frustrated” headteachers who were spending “hours and hours” trying to access the Edenred ordering system. Williamson acknowledged schools had faced challenges because of the high level of demand. “We’ve been doing everything we can to support them in terms of being able to get these vouchers out as rapidly as possible.” The education secretary reiterated plans for an autumn series of what he described as “shortened” exams for pupils unhappy with their grades  which will this year be calculated largely on teacher assessment as exams have been cancelled. There have been reports that some headteachers are opposed  arguing that it would be “totally impractical”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c96669fce76b82170434d8a6542385aa29d295/0_0_4979_2988/master/4979.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bbc637f9fc71c3db15c7517215ebc055 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Schools%2CEducation%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CGavin+Williamson%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/uk-turned-down-offer-of-10000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-four-weeks-ago,world, UK turned down offer of 10 000 tests a day four weeks ago, Government declined ‘game-changing’ US-approved coronavirus saliva tests, As the UK looks set to miss its target  the Guardian can reveal that the government spurned an offer nearly four weeks ago to purchase vast quantities of US-approved home testing kits from a firm carrying out tests for the US air force  and the states of Florida and Alaska. The California-based company  Curative  offered to supply 50 000 saliva tests a week immediately  with the potential to increase this to 50 000 tests a day. On the day of the offer  4 April  the UK had capacity to do just 15 499 tests a day and was only testing 8 651 people a day – far lower than other European nations such as Germany. The missed opportunity comes as the UK remains under severe strain due to an apparent lack of its ability to pursue a ‘“test and trace” strategy. Experts have said the UK should not end the lockdown without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing. On Monday  the latest day for which figures are available  only 43 453 tests were carried out on 29 000 people  while the daily capacity of 73 400 remains well below the target of 100 000  which the government has pledged to hit by Thursday. The government can currently only provide 5 000 home-testing kits a day  but said it is “ramping up” this capacity. The Curative test  which has been approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency (FDA)  is less invasive and easier to use than the nasal swabs currently favoured in the UK as they only require a saliva sample from inside the mouth  rather than deep in the back of the throat or nose. The two-minute test is self-administered and can be used at home without supervision  removing the need for potential Covid-19 victims to drive to testing facilities. It also lifts some of the strain on NHS staff  who are required to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) to oversee the current tests. The results are analysed in the US and emailed within 72 hours  Curative said. Early studies in the US  including one by Yale University  have found the saliva test to be as accurate - if not more so - than the nasal swab test and some scientists have hailed it as “game-changing”. Curative is rapidly expanding its testing in the US and currently provides tests for the US air force as well as the states of Florida and Alaska  and the city of Los Angeles. It says it conducts nearly a quarter of all testing in California. Philip Beales  a professor at the University College London Institute of Child Health  who has been helping to coordinate the efforts of UK testing firms  said saliva tests such as those provided by Curative “really could get us out of this epidemiological nightmare”. In the US  experts have predicted that saliva testing will allow three times as many people to be tested per day and reduce the need for PPE by as much as 90%. Officials in Oklahoma and New Jersey are planning to deploy saliva tests in the coming days  the Washington Post has reported. The so-called “next-gen” saliva test was developed in just 10 days earlier this year by Curative  which is run by 25-year-old Fred Turner  who won the EU’s contest for young scientists in 2013. The Yorkshire-born scientist was named UK young engineer of the year in the same year when  aged 17  he built a DNA machine from his bedroom to discover whether he had the “ginger gene”  after merciless teasing from his schoolmates about why his brother had red hair and he had brown hair. He turned his focus to the coronavirus when the pandemic took hold in January. Turner’s company contacted the UK government to offer its tests on 4 April  two days after Hancock’s 100 000-tests-a-day pledge. It received a brief reply from an unnamed official three days later to say the government was not interested because Curative’s test was “undifferentiated against the existing portfolio of tests”. However  the response has caused confusion because the UK is not thought to have any of the next-gen saliva tests  as officials have focused on the nasopharyngeal swabs. When contacted by the Guardian  the Department of Health and Social Care said it already had partnerships to supply hundreds of thousands of [nasal] swab tests and did not need any more. Labour’s Bill Esterson  the shadow international trade minister  said: “The government could have hit its 100 000 target weeks ago. Curative gave the government the scientific evidence needed to show they met the specification on 4 April. It makes no sense that the government dismissed them out of hand.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b96835955c1ffd66d2979b4d29299878186aad/0_68_2200_1321/master/2200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7938d69576de78e78e55702aafb53589 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CScience%2CUK+news%2CHealth+policy%2CMatt+Hancock%2CHealth%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown,world, 'Social bubbles' of small groups could be early step out of UK lockdown, Boris Johnson believed to be looking at plan to let people add close family to their households, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman signalled No 10 was open to the idea on Wednesday  saying it was “very alive to the issue of social isolation and the need for mental wellbeing”. His comments reflected the priority the government is putting on trying to find a way for people to see close family  believing that is the aspect of the lockdown that people are finding toughest. Under the social bubble proposal  people would be allowed to combine their household with one or two others  up to a maximum of 10 people. A cautious version of the plan would probably mean that the vulnerable such as the over-70s and those with underlying health conditions would be advised to keep isolating and not merge with other households. However  experts are concerned that the government needs to more rigorously quarantine new cases of coronavirus at the point that it moves to the “test  track and isolate” phase advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ministers have already conceded the need for mass testing and an army of contact tracers  after abandoning that strategy of containment early in the epidemic. They now talk about the need for “a test  track and trace” policy. But critics said they are making a mistake by failing to talk about a tougher isolation response  which in some other countries involves a longer  14-day period of quarantining for confirmed cases and asking some to quarantine in state facilities. China has even made forcible quarantining mandatory  although that is unlikely to occur in the UK. Jeremy Hunt  the chair of the health select committee and a former health secretary  told the Guardian: “The key point about the success [of] South Korea and Taiwan is that it was as much a quarantining strategy as it was a contact tracing strategy  with the object to take out of circulation anyone who has Covid or is likely to have Covid.” At No 10’s daily press briefing  Dominic Raab  the foreign secretary  and Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England suggested the government could look at relocating care home residents sick with coronavirus to the largely empty Nightingale hospitals as part of the strategy to bolster quarantining in the future. However  they said it would have to be done carefully and was only one of the options under review. The UK may also consider asking those with confirmed coronavirus to quarantine for longer than the seven days currently required. Speaking in the House of Lords  James Bethell  a health minister  signalled this was actively under review. “The question of isolation remains one for which we are reviewing our advice. We are in constant contact with other countries to learn more about best practice ” he said. Paul Hunter  professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia  said the UK ought to require a 14-day period of isolation for those with symptoms  in line with the WHO. “At the moment it probably doesn’t matter a great deal  because we’re not trying to stop every transmission  but if we manage to get to the point where there are very low numbers in the community  letting people out before 14 days is a significant source of concern ” he said. Under such circumstances  he said  more thought needs to be given to increasing compliance. “Once we’re back to small numbers we cannot afford to allow rogue citizens to do what they like. There are undoubtedly people in the UK who ignore guidance. Not many  but some. A person like that could ultimately be responsible for going into a care home and introducing the infection  causing 20-30 residents to die over the next month. We’ve got to take that seriously.” Another expert  Devi Sridhar  the global public policy chair at the University of Edinburgh  said the government could consider recommending isolation outside the home if confirmed cases live with vulnerable people. “‘Test  trace  isolate’ only works if each of those components are included ” she said. “There needs to be work in tandem across these three areas including on how incentives are created for people to isolate at home for 14 days or alternative housing arrangements if they live with elderly or vulnerable individuals.” No 10 has repeatedly talked about the possibility that lockdown restrictions could be both loosened in some areas and tightened in other areas  as the government seeks a balance between returning to normal life and trying to avoid a second peak of the virus. Priti Patel  the home secretary  signalled tougher quarantining requirements on new arrivals in the UK are also under consideration when she appeared before the home affairs committee on Wednesday. Further restrictions could include asking people to wear face coverings in enclosed public places  which is already recommended in Scotland. Social bubbles is one of the possible ways of easing restrictions  but other possibilities include letting some shops reopen  encouraging people to go back to work with staggered start times and social distancing  and reopening schools with smaller class sizes and different opening hours. Asked on Wednesday whether the government was considering social bubbles  Johnson’s spokesman said: “We have said there’s extensive work going on in government to look at the next phase of the coronavirus response and also talked about how we could relax measures in some areas and toughen them in others. We are also very alive to the issue of social isolation and the need for mental wellbeing  as people help us to deal with the spread of this pandemic. “But in terms of specific details  you will have to wait until such a time as we have full medical and scientific advice  and we’re ready to set out what happens next. We will have to take decisions based on the scientific evidence and guided by the fact we are not going to do anything which could lead to the virus being able to spread exponentially again.” A Whitehall source told the Guardian that it was one of many options under consideration and not one of the most outlandish but “there are lots of details that would have to be worked out before it is workable”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a13889b6df7c7e6892e29f4489e36a7fce4d0ee/0_1320_2838_1703/master/2838.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99066dc3861a7e59da387da2b07ea6e6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CMedical+research%2CBoris+Johnson%2CUK+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CPolitics%2CScience%2COlder+people%2CWorld+Health+Organization%2CJeremy+Hunt https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/so-what-bolsonaro-shrugs-off-brazil-rising-coronavirus-death-toll,world, 'So what?': Bolsonaro shrugs off Brazil's rising coronavirus death toll, Outrage at president’s response to news that more than 5 000 people have lost their lives, But on Tuesday night Brazil’s president shrugged off the news. “So what?” Jair Bolsonaro told reporters when asked about the record 474 deaths that day. “I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?” Bolsonaro’s 11-word response – the latest in a series of remarks belittling the pandemic – sparked immediate fury. One newspaper  the Estado de Minas  stamped the president’s words on to a black front page beside Brazil’s death toll: 5 017. “Bolsonaro isn’t just an awful politician and a bad president  he’s a despicable human being ” tweeted Marcelo Freixo  a leftwing opponent. “My name’s Messiah ” Bolsonaro also told reporters on Tuesday  in reference to his second name  Messias. “But I can’t work miracles.” A wave of disgust swept over social media as word of the president’s comments spread. “A sociopath ” tweeted the musician Nando Moura. “What a tragedy ” wrote the journalist Sônia Bridi. “It’s a mockery. An insult. It is intolerable ” tweeted Mariliz Pereira Jorge  a scriptwriter and commentator. Another critic superimposed Bolsonaro’s words on to a photograph of the muddy graves into which scores of Brazilian bodies are being deposited each day. “Bolsonaro wants to turn Brazil into the Republic of So What ” the political commentator Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in his column on Wednesday. The president’s son Carlos Bolsonaro claimed on Twitter that his father’s comments were being distorted by liberal journalists seeking to destroy his reputation. Since Brazil confirmed its first coronavirus case on 26 February  Bolsonaro has continually minimised the pandemic  rejecting media “hysteria” over its dangers and suggesting Brazilians could swim in excrement and emerge unscathed. The Trump-admiring populist has also purposefully undermined social distancing guidelines  mingling with supporters and sacking his health minister on 16 April after he publicly challenged the president’s behaviour. Last week  Bolsonaro’s popular justice minister  Sergio Moro  resigned from government  partly as a result of the president’s anti-scientific stance on Covid-19  according to one person who knows him. There is no escaping the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Brazil  with daily images of gravediggers in protective suits emerging from some of the worst-hit cities  including Rio de Janeiro  São Paulo  Recife and Manaus. As Bolsonaro made his remarks  newspapers and television programmes filled with stories about the mothers  fathers  sons and daughters losing their lives to the pandemic. In Rio  the victims included Ana Maria  a 56-year-old nursing assistant who had worked in one of the city’s biggest public hospitals and was laid to rest on Tuesday by men in white suits. “She gave everything to her job until the very end ” her daughter Taina told Associated Press. In Vila Operária  a redbrick favela to the north of Rio  at least 10 residents were reported to have died  including four members of the same family. Health specialists fear Covid-19 – which is moving into poor regions  having initially affected middle- and upper-class areas – could wreak havoc on Brazil’s most deprived and vulnerable communities. “I’m scared ” Josiete Pereira do Carmo  who lost her mother and three uncles  told one local TV network. “We can’t lose anyone else.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27f0add16bc9728849cae20f2ad063bff8e70d85/0_241_3233_1940/master/3233.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c79e167e3b121f44c5a0d47644f72d6e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2961cc36cc46916fba8b7f19e6908515af2b38b/116_837_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f3087e0dd493c008cdab8d9b9ae2b94 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brazil%2CJair+Bolsonaro%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

Arancha González Laya  Spain’s foreign minister  on Wednesday said visitors would be welcomed back to the country – which has suffered Europe’s highest Covid-19 death toll after Italy – only when it is safe for them to come. “Spain always gives its visitors the warmest possible welcome and wants to do so under the best possible safety conditions ” she said. “That is why Spain will gradually open to tourism when it’s in a position to guarantee tourists’ safety.” As EU commissioners debated plans to help Europe’s tourist industry  which makes up nearly 10% of the bloc’s economy  and transport ministers discussed harmonising lockdown exit plans  González Laya said Madrid was “working with our EU partners. As soon as possible  we’ll welcome people with open arms  as is the Spanish way.” The socialist-led coalition government has announced a four-phase transition towards “the new normality” focusing on hitting landmark targets rather than meeting deadlines  and with decisions taken on a province-by-province basis  meaning areas less affected by the virus will ease restrictions earlier. Spain has suffered more than 24 000 coronavirus deaths and public prosecutors on Wednesday announced that 109 care homes were the subject of criminal investigations relating to the pandemic  including 42 in the Madrid region  where 5 811 people in such facilities have died from the virus. France made no mention of international travel in its detailed roadmap out of lockdown on Tuesday but the prime minister  Édouard Philippe  said the staggered déconfinement  beginning on 11 May  would vary from area to area depending on the number of cases  restricting travel even within France’s regions. Only those on urgent professional or personal business will be able to travel more than 100km (60 miles) from their homes at least until 2 June. France already expects all inbound passengers to state an essential reason for their journey. Underlining the hurdles to foreign travel  Russia’s prime minister  Mikhail Mishustin  extended an entry ban on foreigners that was introduced in mid-March  saying it would be maintained “until the fight against the infection is over and the epidemic situation has improved”. The brutal economic impact of the pandemic deepened on Wednesday  with the US announcing that economic output had shrunk 4.8% in the first quarter of the year  the steepest decline since the Great Recession of 2008  and Germany’s economy minister  Peter Altmeier  saying the country would experience “the worst recession in the history of the federal republic”  founded in 1949. The International Labour Organisation also warned that half the global workforce – 1.6 billion people  working mainly in the informal economy with little or no job security – are in “immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed”. As governments across Europe continued to wrestle with the dilemma of how best to lift confinement measures that are exacting a disastrous toll on their economies while avoiding a dangerous second wave of contagion  Germany on Wednesday made face masks mandatory in all shops  which began reopening last week. Nose and mouth coverings are already compulsory on buses  trains and trams in Germany and will become so in France from 11 May  when people will again be free to leave their homes providing they observe strict physical distancing. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker  the coronavirus has infected more than 3.1 million people worldwide and killed nearly 218 000. The US reported its millionth case  and at more than 58 000 its death toll is by far the world’s highest  surpassing the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam war. Italy  Spain and France have been the worst affected countries in continental Europe  but daily death tallies and infection rates appear to be on a broadly downward trend  and many countries have begun gradually lifting restrictions. China  where the pandemic originated  appears to have the virus under control  with no new deaths reported for two consecutive weeks and confirmed fatalities at about 4 600  although experts have cast doubt on the accuracy of its figures. State media said on Wednesday the country’s top legislature would hold its annual meeting  postponed for the first time in decades  from 22 May  in a move widely interpreted as signalling that Beijing believes it has contained its outbreak. India’s confirmed death toll passed 1 000 on Wednesday  but the numbers remain low compared with Europe and the US in a phenomenon that is puzzling experts. With huge slums and a less than perfect healthcare system  there were fears India would be ravaged by the pandemic. But the country  which imposed a strict lockdown on its 1.3 billion people on 25 March when it had recorded just 10 deaths  has so far avoided the devastation seen in many other nations. However  its overall death toll of 1 007 could be far lower than the real number of victims owing to a lack of testing and other factors. The Brazilian president  Jair Bolsonaro  caused fury by shrugging off the news that the country had recorded a record 474 deaths  bringing its total to 5 000 – more than China’s official tally. “So what?” Bolsonaro told reporters. “I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f945dfb373c9dbe82bfaf6a8e0ebb9c50ad3fe/0_232_4173_2505/master/4173.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b1fe7da48c8f61a4b04ba1eab84c9d2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd7ca40c0e4a12afe9c8a209a6e051e43f2334b/0_319_4361_2617/master/4361.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1d3e8ded5ecba2e9822609435d2ed9c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CSpain%2CGermany%2CTravel+%26+leisure%2CEurope%2CFrance%2CRussia%2CChina%2CIndia%2CAsia+Pacific%2CSouth+and+Central+Asia%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens,world, China bristles at Australia's call for investigation into coronavirus origin, Beijing warns relationship could be damaged ‘beyond repair’ after Australian prime minister Scott Morrison cites ‘extraordinary’ impact of Covid-19, China has been pushing back against criticism from other governments about how it handled the outbreak of Covid-19  which is believed to have started in Wuhan and which has now infected 3 million people worldwide and killed 200 000. Donald Trump’s accusation at the weekend that Beijing could have done more to prevent the deadly spread of the disease was met with fierce criticism from China’s state media. While Australia has eschewed the more strident approach of the US  which has stopped funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO)  it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and suggested recruiting independent investigators akin to “weapons inspectors” to determine the source of major disease outbreaks. On Wednesday Morrison said his government “will of course continue to pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action”. “This is a virus that has taken more than 200 000 lives across the world ” he told reporters in Canberra. It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary. “Now  it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred  so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again.” Australia’s stance has angered Beijing  which has denied wrongdoing during the pandemic . In recent days Chinese state media has run numerous inflammatory statements including that Australia was “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe”  doing the work of the US but without holding any influence  and risking longterm damage to its bilateral relationship and trading partnership with China. On Tuesday  the Chinese embassy released details of a call from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat)  and in a further move to embarrass the Morrison government  claimed the Dfat secretary had said it was “not the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal”. The move came after warnings by China’s ambassador to Australia  Jingye Cheng  on Monday over consumer boycotts  described by an Australian minister as “threats of economic coercion”. A Tuesday night editorial in the Global Times accused Australia of “panda bashing” and victim blaming  and Morrison of “adventurism” which could damage the bilateral relationship “beyond repair”. “The Morrison government’s adventurism to fiddle with this mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership is in defiance of rational thought and common sense ” it said. “Canberra is treading on a hazardous path that has no prospect for a U-turn during the Covid-19 pandemic  and likely for a long time afterward.” But on Wednesday Morrison insisted the investigation “is not targeted” and refused to buy in to the war of words with China  saying the response was “a matter for them”. “Australia will do what is in our interest  in the global interest  and we will of course continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here.” Morrison said Australia’s relationship with China was “mutually beneficial” and noted its trade with China consisted mainly of export of resources. “I see no reason why that would alter in the future.” In other coronavirus developments around the world: , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9f60af6fe47feafad4d7a14262b8592d7fa66a1/0_354_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a21427cbfe262d28daf10ba13f911c94 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CChina%2CAustralia+news%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/germany-to-set-out-rules-for-religious-services-including-singing-ban,world, Germany to set out rules for religious services including singing ban, Angela Merkel to meet with state leaders over safely conducting services during pandemic, Religious services have been banned since the start of Germany’s lockdown in mid-March and some worshippers have expressed fury at the government’s apparent slowness in plotting a route back to reopening churches. A loosening of restrictions a week ago after Germany’s infection rate decreased sufficiently  saw small shops  along with bicycle repair workshops  car washes and other businesses  able to operate again. But places of worship have not been viewed as such a political priority  despite pleas from religious leaders that spiritual nourishment is as important to many Germans  if not more so  than shopping. One Catholic community in Berlin  which insisted on continuing to celebrate mass  even took the government to court over the ban. Angela Merkel  a pastor’s daughter and herself a regular church-goer  will meet the leaders of the country’s 16 states on Thursday to coordinate a nationwide set of rules. Religious leaders have agreed in advance meetings a set of general rules on strict physical distancing and the prohibition of anything involving bodily fluids  such as kissing religious objects  including the Jewish Torah  or administering communion from hand to mouth. Muslim leaders have agreed a temporary halt to Friday prayers. Communal singing has reportedly proved to be a particular sticking point in the discussions  despite repeated warnings by leading epidemiologists that singing is as dangerous as coughing for spreading the virus. Reports around the globe including in Los Angeles  where three-quarters of the members of one choir fell ill and two died  and in Berlin  where 59 out of 78 singers from the choir of Berlin’s Protestant cathedral went down with the virus – have offered plenty of anecdotal evidence that singing in choirs has contributed to the spread of coronavirus in some communities. Lothar Wieler  the head of the German government’s disease control agency  the Robert Koch Institute  specifically warned on Tuesday that singing was ill-advised. “Evidence shows that during singing  the virus drops appear to fly particularly far ” he said. Virologists also believe singers could absorb many more particles as they tend to breathe deeper into their diaphragms than they would during normal breathing. A draft bans both communal singing and wind instruments from services over the “amplified precipitation of potentially infectious drops” and while it has been backed in principle by Protestant leaders  who nevertheless wish to draw a distinction between roomy cathedrals and small village churches  Catholic heads are opposed. “If the distance rules are abided by  there is no reason why singing should be refrained from altogether ” the German Bishops Conference has said in its own position paper. A spokesman added: “We believe quiet singing and praying should be possible.” It has been argued that the government has been slow to act on church re-openings to ensure police were not overwhelmed when carrying out controls necessitated by a step-by-step easing of restrictions  as well as the nationwide introduction this week of obligatory face coverings. Priority has been given to Germany’s 30 000 mosques and prayer rooms which have been allowed to open during the month of Ramadan. Muslim worshippers are obliged to wear a mouth and nose covering on entering mosques  and over-65s have been advised to stay away for their own protection. Each worshipper should have at least 10 square metres of space to themselves. Bavaria  which often takes a singular approach to regulation  allowed church services of under 15 people to resume over a week ago  with the Catholic church issuing seat reservations to regulate the flow of worshippers. Priests are prohibited from administering communion on the tongue and holy water is banned. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1995dac9fce7092d5e14604bbf9fa70794ed8200/0_367_5503_3302/master/5503.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=270becc6fc4d5048ca58a6469563b0c4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CReligion%2CCatholicism%2CChristianity%2CIslam%2CJudaism%2CEurope%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/mobs-stop-indian-doctors-burials-covid-19,world, Mobs stop Indian doctors' burials: 'Covid-19 took his life  why take his dignity?', Attack on funeral of Tamil Nadu neurosurgeon just one example of coronavirus misinformation, At about six feet deep they stopped. Kumar  convulsing with sorrow  rolled the wrapped body of his colleague  Dr Simon Hercules  into the grave  then quickly covered it over with earth. Under the cover of midnight darkness  the three men ran for their lives out of the cemetery. “What happened to Dr Simon made me lose my faith in humanity ” said Kumar. “It should never happen to anyone ever  ever again.” The events surrounding the death of Hercules  one of several doctors to die from Covid-19 in the state of Tamil Nadu in the past few weeks  are symptomatic of a plague of misinformation about the virus that is having devastating consequences across India. In particular  the fear that coronavirus can spread from a dead body has led to several doctors and patients being denied dignified burials  with their funerals the target of mob ire. Hercules had been a familiar face around Chennai’s New Hope hospital. The 55-year-old neurosurgeon and hospital managing director was known as a gentle  hardworking man of few words; nothing would get between him and his patients  not even a global pandemic. But three weeks ago he developed a cough and fever  then was put on a ventilator for respiratory distress. Already vulnerable as a diabetic with high blood pressure  he died last Sunday. Yet as news of his death from Covid-19 flashed up on local TV channels  the community’s response was not sorrow  but anger. Hercules was a Christian so his body would be buried  not cremated as is the Hindu custom. That night a crowd of around 200 gathered at the Christian cemetery to demand officials refuse to bury the doctor there  fearing the virus would spread into the soil. Emergency arrangements were made to bury the doctor at another Christian cemetery. But  as his wife  Anandhi  and 18-year-old son  Anton  and several colleagues  including Kumar  an orthopaedic surgeon at New Hope hospital  stood by the graveside  a violent mob descended. “They were screaming at us to leave and take the body before it spread the virus to everyone ” said Kumar. “It was a crowd of about 60 people  pelting us with sticks and stones. We all had to run for our lives. The ambulance drivers got very badly injured as they desperately put Dr Simon’s body back in the ambulance  and all the windows got smashed as they were driving away. It was terrifying  and so traumatic for his wife and son.” Back at the medical centre  Kumar gathered two assistants  put on personal protective equipment and got back into the damaged ambulance  where Hercules still lay  his body bag now covered in glass and broken medical equipment. They drove back to the cemetery and there  at midnight  dug Hercules’s grave  terrified the the mob would return. “It was terrible  his family wasn’t even there ” said Kumar  his voice shaking. “Coronavirus already took his life  why should it also take his dignity in death?” Hercules’ family told the Guardian they were too traumatised to speak. Dr K Senthil  president of the Tamil Nadu Doctor’s Association  said Hercules’ case had been a wake-up call for state authorities. “When we heard what had happened we were all shocked and saddened and were extremely angry at the government as well ” he said. “The Tamil Nadu chief minister has promised that from now on any healthcare official who dies from Covid will be given a formal government funeral and [he will] ensure that army and police personnel will be present.” Yet Hercules’s case is far from a one-off. Coronavirus has reached even the most remote corners of India and there are now upwards of 25 000 cases  with misinformation and attacks on both the living who have caught the virus  and the dead  becoming widespread. On 15 April  Dr John L Sailo Ryntathiang  69  the founder and director of Bethany Hospital in Shillong  become the first doctor in the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya to die of Covid-19. The news was met with panic  and the family’s plans to cremate his body and place his ashes in a coffin to be buried at his farmhouse were halted when hundreds of protesters descended on the crematorium. The crematorium then refused to deal with the body  while on social media the dead doctor and his family were subjected to abuse. For 36 hours  no place could be found to lay Ryntathiang to rest and  in desperation  his son-in-law Arthur Wungthingthing published an open letter. “We do not know whether his cremation is over. We were not there to weep beside his body ” he wrote  adding: “My father-in-law literally spent his life in the treatment of his patients. This is not an acceptable way to honour his memory.” Both Kumar and Ryntathiang’s son  David Sailo  said they did not blame people  who were fearful and deprived of information on coronavirus  and said it was the government’s responsibility to educate the community about the virus  and offer adequate protection for medical staff  both in life and in death. “It was a terrible ordeal for the family but we do not hold anyone responsible ” Sailo said. “The fault lies with the government that proper advocacy on this issue was not given to the public. We take it as a blessing that our family has been chosen as the Covid-19 family and so many shortcomings have been exposed. The government still seems to be asleep.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Hannah-Ellis-Petersen,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5a4153fc3d930106845786ddca73dc2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1002aa06ce08ef8ad3b2f9510eb817e84778237e/0_19_3432_2060/master/3432.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a89c90b1971907484cf5919aa8df1dc https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=India%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CSociety%2CSouth+and+Central+Asia%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/sweet-city-the-costa-rica-suburb-that-gave-citizenship-to-bees-plants-and-trees-aoe,environment, 'Sweet City': the Costa Rica suburb that gave citizenship to bees  plants and trees, A suburb of the country’s capital is showing how urban planning can be harnessed to benefit both humans and wildlife, “Pollinators are the consultants of the natural world  supreme reproducers and they don’t charge for it. The plan to convert every street into a biocorridor and every neighbourhood into an ecosystem required a relationship with them.” The move to extend citizenship to pollinators  trees and native plants in Curridabat has been crucial to the municipality’s transformation from an unremarkable suburb of the Costa Rican capital  San José  into a pioneering haven for urban wildlife. Now known as “Ciudad Dulce” – Sweet City – Curridabat’s urban planning has been reimagined around its non-human inhabitants. Green spaces are treated as infrastructure with accompanying ecosystem services that can be harnessed by local government and offered to residents. Geolocation mapping is used to target reforestation projects at elderly residents and children to ensure they benefit from air pollution removal and the cooling effects that the trees provide. The widespread planting of native species underscores a network of green spaces and biocorridors across the municipality  which are designed to ensure pollinators thrive. “The idea came from a narrative that people in cities are prone to defending nature when it is far away  when it is a distant concept  but they are negligent when it comes to protecting nature in their immediate environment ” says Mora  who has since become a senior design strategist with the global architecture firm Gensler  after a brief spell as education minister. “Urban development should be  at least to some extent  aligned with the landscape instead of the other way round ” he says. The metropolitan area surrounding San José is home to more than 2 million people – about half of the population of Costa Rica – despite covering less than 5% of the country’s area. Were it not for the lush volcanic peaks that surround Costa Rica’s central valley  it would not be immediately obvious that you were in the heart of one of the most biodiverse countries on the planet. Humans dominate and the country’s cloud forests  pristine coastline and emblematic sloths can feel a long way from the concrete and traffic. “We attract a lot of tourists because of nature and conservation but there is still friction in the city ” says Irene Garcia  head of innovation at the mayor’s office in Curridabat  who oversees the Sweet City project. “Places like San José do not represent what we sell as a country or what you see in rural areas or the beaches. Costa Rica has differentiated itself significantly but our cities are a long way behind.” Urbanisation is one of the primary drivers of biodiversity loss around the world  according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)  with urban areas having doubled since 1992. By the middle of the century  the UN projects that 68% of humanity will live in towns and cities  placing further pressure on ecosystems and rapidly vanishing habitats. But many urban planners are trying to change this relationship and the importance of green spaces in towns and cities has been recognised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss  often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature. Sweet City is just one of a number of biocorridors around the country that allow the genetic spread of species to maintain their strength. In Central America  this concept has developed since the early 2000s following an agreement to form a biocorridor network to connect jaguars. “Grey infrastructure makes the city warm up too much. So the idea to connect green areas is to cool down parts of the city  return the ecosystem services that were there previously but have deteriorated ” says Magalli Castro Álvarez  who oversees Costa Rica’s network of biocorridors with the National System of Conservation Areas (Sinac). “Inter-urban biocorridors have a double objective: they create ecological connectivity for biodiversity but also improve green infrastructure through roads and river banks lined with trees that are linked with the small forested areas that still exist in metropolitan areas. They improve air quality  water quality and give people spaces to relax  have fun and improve their health.” Many Costa Ricans are happy to speak about the policy benefits of schemes such as Sweet City   as their response to the challenges of bringing nature into the city is part of a deeper national sentiment. It is not in this tiny Central American country’s DNA to behave as if humans were somehow set apart from nature. It was a Costa Rican  Christiana Figueres  who brought the world together to reach the Paris agreement. More than 98% of Costa Rica’s energy comes from renewable sources and it plans to completely decarbonise by 2050 – one of the most ambitious goals on the planet. The country has also successfully reversed one of the world’s highest deforestation rates. “In Costa Rica  you can start your day in the Caribbean  in the Atlantic ocean  but then you can travel and on the same day  you can see the sun set in the Pacific ” says the country’s president  Carlos Alvarado Quesada  who credits Costa Rica’s tradition of pacifism and respect for nature with its desire to tackle big environmental issues. “Even though we have a small territory  its characteristics allow us to have 6% of the biodiversity of the world in our land. Those are traits that are special. “I had to travel far away to understand that many of the answers were back home and the challenge was taking that legacy to the next level.” Find more age of extinction coverage here  and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/26/Sep/2019/d8e6942a-3e62-4304-a55d-d4b2200ae21d-BandWyss stacked(2).png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8dfd0758a3f1dac523a46a17030e777c71dca14/0_0_1280_853/master/1280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68d369e99684fa297fbdfe597a482026 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5156336ba608dde7f9594ce0e6c9f9d251ad1fee/0_115_720_640/master/720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77eccf5069e1070582bdf8b1ba34c4df https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03200f3b662be726738b4966bd0eebc25a05a907/472_113_2437_1462/master/2437.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1437d11e694b10750e6853516baa2668 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5cc8e06625f2d103cace4a74c5cece4911b8e7d/0_0_960_720/master/960.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=101f83cd374c6ea16ae057bb7ff022b5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df68337cdb52f56a70783d7cc9317bc18fd2a32/0_0_3648_2431/master/3648.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f25d9988dac21f965bed033f939811de https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Costa+Rica%2CBiodiversity%2CConservation%2CEnvironment%2CWorld+news%2CGlobal+development%2CWildlife%2CAmericas%2CInsects%2CAnimals https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/myanmar-military-may-be-repeating-crimes-against-humanity-un-rapporteur-warns,world, Myanmar military may be repeating crimes against humanity  UN rapporteur warns, Yanghee Lee says the army is ‘maximising suffering’ on Rohingya and other people in attacks reminiscent of the 2017 assault in Rakhine state, In a damning statement issued on Wednesday  Yanghee Lee said the military was inflicting immense suffering on communities living in conflict-affected states  and called for increased efforts to “ensure that there is not another systemic failure like in 2017”. The military had also expanded its campaign against minorities from Rakhine to neighbouring Chin state  she said. Myanmar is already facing allegations of genocide over a brutal military crackdown that began in August 2017  and which forced more than 700 000 Rohingya Muslims to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Earlier this year  Myanmar was instructed by the UN’s highest court to take action to prevent genocidal violence against Rohingya citizens and to report back on its progress. Citizens of all ethnicities living in conflict areas are now being targeted by the military  Lee’s statement said. Despite calls from the UN for a global ceasefire during the coronavirus crisis  the military  known as the Tatmadaw  has instead escalated its fight against the Arakan Army (AA)  an ethnic Rakhine rebel group seeking greater autonomy from central government. The military has not only injured and killed scores of civilians  including children  in recent air and artillery strikes  Lee said  but also blocked some of the injured from accessing urgent medical care. In one case  a teenage boy died at a military checkpoint in Rakhine after the military forced the vehicle transporting him to wait there on the way to hospital. It is not clear how the boy was injured. In attacks that are reminiscent of the 2017 military assault on Rohingya people  schools  houses  a Buddhist temple  and in one case a village of up to 700 homes had been destroyed or burned to the ground. The military has also disappeared  arrested  tortured or killed dozens of men  often accusing them of links to the Arakan Army. Entire villages have fled the violence. “Having faced no accountability  the Tatmadaw continues to operate with impunity. For decades  its tactics have intentionally maximised civilian suffering; we all know what they did to the Rohingya in 2017. They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area  with people from Rakhine  Rohingya  Mro  Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months ” said Lee  who is concluding her tenure as special rapporteur. Lee cited a recent artillery attack  on 13 April  in which eight civilians died  including at least two children  when the military targeted Kyauk Seik village in Ponnagyun township. “The Tatmadaw is systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights. Its conduct against the civilian population of Rakhine and Chin states may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity ” she added. The UN secretary general  António Guterres  has urged warring parties globally to put down their weapons so that all efforts could be focused on protecting civilians from the spread of Covid-19. Humanitarian agencies fear communities in conflict areas are especially vulnerable to the virus  which could spread quickly in camps where displaced people are living in close quarters with extremely limited access to healthcare. Earlier this month  a driver working for the World Health Organization who was transporting swabs from patients to be tested for coronavirus was killed after his vehicle was attacked by gunfire in Rakhine state. Both Myanmar’s army and the Arakan Army denied responsibility for the attack. More than 157 000 people have been displaced since the conflict began  according to the UN. Vast numbers of people have been cut off from aid by the military  including 8 000 displaced people sheltering in Paletwa township in Chin. Internet access is also blocked in many conflict-affected areas  meaning people have little access to information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus  and making it harder for communities to document atrocities committed by armed actors. A crackdown on journalists has also been ramped up  forcing editors to live in hiding and further restricting information about human rights abuses. Civilians have also been affected by violence carried out by the Arakan Army  which has kidnapped local officials and parliamentarians. Just weeks ago  the group is reported to have abducted an elected member of a Paletwa township committee. However the Arakan Army has declared a unilateral ceasefire  which has improved protections for civilians. Lee called for an investigation into allegations of ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity in both Rakhine and Chin states  to ensure perpetrators are held to account. Lee also urged the UN to increase protections for civilians. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ea924b607f4f52e4a5ab390920d87698b6caf5/0_165_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4dbcda8a4d3094161a814e80a501a7d0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Myanmar%2CUnited+Nations%2CSouth+and+Central+Asia https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/bollywood-star-irrfan-khan-dies-aged-53,film, Irrfan Khan dies aged 53, Khan  an icon of Indian cinema who had a string of Anglo-American successes under his belt  including Slumdog Millionaire  Life of Pi and Jurassic World  has died in Mumbai, He had been admitted to the intensive care unit of Mumbai’s Kokilaben hospital on Tuesday with a colon infection and on Wednesday morning a statement was released confirming his death. “It’s saddening that this day  we have to bring forward the news of him passing away ” read the statement. “Irrfan was a strong soul  someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him.” Despite his status as one of Bollywood’s most celebrated actors  Khan had a reputation for modesty and integrity and news of his death sent India into mourning  prompting actors  fans and politicians from across the world to express their sadness at his death. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said that Khan’s demise was “a loss to the world of cinema and theatre. He will be remembered for his versatile performances across different mediums. My thoughts are with his family  friends and admirers. May his soul rest in peace.” Fellow Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan said Khan’s death left a “huge vacuum”. “An incredible talent  a gracious colleague  a prolific contributor to the world of cinema … left us too soon ” tweeted Bachchan. “The charisma you brought to everything you did was pure magic ” tweeted Priyanka Chopra. “Your talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues. You inspired so many of us. Irrfan Khan you will truly be missed. Condolences to the family.” Indian politician Rahul Gandhi described Khan as a “versatile and talented actor” who would be “greatly missed” while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said India had lost “one of the most exceptional actors of our time.” In March 2018  Khan revealed he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour  but after extensive treatment he recovered well enough to shoot Angrezi Medium  the film that would turn out to be his last  and whose release this March was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Best known to English-speaking audiences as the police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire and for his roles in Jurassic World and Life of Pi  Khan was a Bollywood mainstay  acting in hits such as Haider  Piku and Hindi Medium. “I always object to the word Bollywood ” he told the Guardian in 2013. “I don’t think it’s fair to have that name. Because that industry has its own technique  its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood. It originates in Parsi theatre.” Khan was born Saahabzaade Irfan Ali Khan in Jaipur in 1966  the son of a tyre seller  and went to drama school after failing as a cricketer. He struggled to make headway in the film industry  despite being cast in a small role as a letter writer in Mira Nair’s 1988 Salaam Bombay! – to his frustration he only managed to find regular work in low-grade TV soap operas. “I came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television ” he told the Guardian. Khan’s breakthrough role came from an unlikely source: the feature debut of then-unknown British director Asif Kapadia  whose low budget samurai-esque tale  The Warrior  was shot in India. Released in 2002  The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebastián film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film. Khan subsequently broke into mainstream Indian films  often playing cops or villains – including the title role of Maqbool  an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth set in the Mumbai underworld. More orthodox Bollywood productions followed  such as Rog and the slice-of-life musical Life in a … Metro. Khan also maintained a parallel career in British-American cinema: he played the chief of police in Michael Winterbottom’s A Mighty Heart  and another police officer in Slumdog Millionaire  which won eight Oscars. In later roles  he became a reliable standby character actor in big-budget Hollywood films  playing a doctor in The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 and businessmen in Jurassic World (2015) and Inferno (2016). In 2012  he also played the adult version of the lead character in another Oscar-winner: Life of Pi  directed by Ang Lee. Director Wes Anderson said he specifically wrote a small role for Khan in his film The Darjeeling Limited just so they could work together. Meanwhile  Khan found box-office success with the Indian-produced art film The Lunchbox  in which he played an accountant who strikes up a letter-writing romance with unhappy housewife Nimrat Kaur. Khan also continued his high Bollywood profile with significant roles in the Amitabh Bachchan comedy Piku and Hindi Medium  as a rich businessman trying to get his daughter into a good school. Khan is survived by his wife  Sutapa Sikdar  and sons Babil and Ayan. , https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/10/Peter_Bradshaw,_L.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84b97c5116c54163cf19d3798fcb5eaad574cf80/387_431_4822_2893/master/4822.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=361f1d049ee8a3c7c4f527fa102cdf69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb25ea48afbe6642cf55e41a329910177300f16/350_0_2076_1246/master/2076.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=392ba126dfbc83628b0b86c7d511ef6b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Irrfan+Khan%2CBollywood%2CFilm%2CIndia%2CSlumdog+Millionaire%2CLife+of+Pi%2CCulture%2CSouth+and+Central+Asia%2CWorld+news%2CJurassic+World https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/airlines-may-not-recover-from-covid-19-crisis-for-five-years-says-airbus,business, Airlines may not recover from Covid-19 crisis for five years  says Airbus, Pandemic is ‘gravest crisis aerospace industry has ever known’  says Guillaume Faury, The Airbus chief executive  Guillaume Faury  warned on Wednesday it could take “three to five years” for passengers to be as willing to fly as before the crisis. Faury said: “We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known.” The pandemic has plunged the airline industry into chaos  with passenger flight revenues all but wiped out. British Airways  a major Airbus customer  on Tuesday evening announced plans to cut 12 000 jobs – almost a third of its workforce – in the face of slump in demand. Brian Strutton  the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa)  on Wednesday told BBC radio that job cuts had not been expected at this stage  given the uncertainties around the outlook for aviation. He added that a “lack of government support” was one of the reasons cited by British Airways for the redundancies. Parent company International Airlines Group’s other airlines  such as Iberia and Vueling in Spain and Ireland’s Aer Lingus  have not yet announced job cuts. During the first three months of the year  Airbus was unable to deliver more than 60 planes to customers because of quarantine restrictions. That number is expected to rise as airlines negotiate delays to orders in an attempt to ease financial pressures. Airbus’s core profits fell by 49% in the first quarter of the year to €281m  while revenues slumped by almost €2bn to €10.6bn. Airbus has already suspended its dividend  cut production by a third and furloughed thousands of staff in some of its key locations  including more than 3 000 at its wing factory in Broughton  north Wales. The manufacturer  which has 135 000 employees worldwide  is also contemplating job cuts to reduce spending. The company has not yet revealed the extent of its restructuring because of uncertainties over airlines’ plans  but it said it would have a better idea of the medium-term outlook by June. “For us  the urgent priority is to implement a short-term cash containment plan ” said Faury. “We are doing this  and address[ing] the longer-term cost structure to ‘right-size’ the company.” However  Faury said the manufacturer’s brutal short-term outlook was coupled with longer-term optimism that the aviation industry will rebound and grow. Before the crisis  the airline industry was forecasting steady growth in global air traffic. Some airlines view the crisis as “an opportunity” to accelerate the switch to newer planes with lower carbon emissions  he added  referring to the potentially greater long-term challenge for the industry of achieving carbon neutrality. While cutting back research and development spending  Airbus is continuing on its A321XLR  an “extra-long-range” aircraft that can deliver emissions and cost savings. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165922517aca64290307cd9c07aa80685533b35a/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7443d889987a6f4219ee4b09c4031676 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Airline+industry%2CAirbus%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/29/elon-musk-tweets-protest-against-us-coronavirus-lockdown,technology, Elon Musk tweets protest against US coronavirus lockdown, Tesla founder says ‘FREE AMERICA NOW’ in outburst against economic impact, His outburst came as he was close to securing a $750m (£585m) payout from a bonus scheme linked to Tesla’s share price. Musk  the world’s 22nd-richest person with an estimated $38.5bn (£30.5bn) fortune  on Wednesday tweeted: “Give people their freedom back!” with a link to a Wall Street Journal article suggesting that the lockdowns have not saved that many lives but have shattered local economies. He also tweeted: “Bravo Texas!” with a link to a local newspaper story about the Texas governor Greg Abbott’s plans to allow shops  restaurants and movie theatres to reopen from Friday. Musk  who has a history of tweeting controversial statements  later clarified that he did not think all shops and businesses should be reopened immediately. Replying to another user on Twitter he said: “Yes  reopen with care & appropriate protection  but don’t everyone under de facto house arrest”. His outburst came a day after Tesla was forced to delay the planned reopening of its electric car factory in Fremont  California  after six Bay Area counties extended the lockdown until the end of May. Tesla had been planning on reopening the factory on 4 May  when the lockdown order was supposed to be lifted. The factory has been shut since 23 March. Despite the closure  Telsa’s share price has recovered nearly all of the slump caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The rebound in the shares to $769 on Tuesday  from a low of $361 on 18 March  puts Musk close to achieving a $720m payday. The rally in the share price puts Tesla’s market capitalisation at $141bn; the company has reached a six-month average valuation of $96bn. If the market cap achieves a six-month average of $100bn it would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of share options granted to Musk. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69m Tesla shares at $350.02 each. If Musk sold those shares at Tuesday’s closing price of $769 he could make a profit of about $750m. Musk’s paper fortune has risen by more than $10bn so far this year. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f78ce46807c24a1cbb3020277e199cb296f25b2/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d36c366f07d7f5238258a374ef35c7f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Elon+Musk%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CBusiness%2CTechnology https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/world-stock-markets-coronavirus-treatment-remdesivir-drug-trial,business, World's stock markets soar on coronavirus treatment hopes, Investors shrug off US growth gloom after promising data from remdesivir drug trial, Despite news that the longest expansion in US history came to an abrupt end in the first three months of 2020  financial markets were buoyed by an update from the American biopharma company Gilead Sciences on its experimental drug remdesivir. US drug regulators are expected to announce they will allow the emergency use of remdesivir in the treatment of the coronavirus following a large scale clinical trial of the anti-viral drug by the US government. Dr Anthony Fauci  the country’s top infectious disease official  told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that initial data on the potential treatment with the experimental drug looked promising but needed further review  adding that he had no timeline for the Food and Drug Administration’s approval. However  a separate set of results published by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday of a trial conducted in China concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings  released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week  were inconclusive because the study was terminated early. The FTSE 100  one gauge of the UK stock market  ended the day up 156 points at 6 115 in its highest close since 6 March. The index has gained more than 1 000 points from its trough of 4 993 on 23 March  meaning the FTSE officially moved into a bull market – when there is a rise of 20% or more. The gauge of shares in the UK’s leading quoted companies is still 19% lower than it was at the start of the year. Wall Street was also in an upbeat mood  ignoring a worse-than-expected 4.8% annualised fall in US growth between January and March  and the predictions from analysts that there was much gloomier news to come in the second quarter. By lunchtime in New York  the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 500 points at 24 651 points and had recouped more than half its losses since the financial markets were thrown into a panic by the global spread of the pandemic in late February and early March. Shares were also boosted by a recovery in oil prices amid signs that stocks of crude were smaller than previously feared  with Brent crude futures up 11%  and by a trading statement from Alphabet  the parent company of Google. Yet it was a statement from Gilead saying that remdesivir had shown positive results when given to patients for either a five-day or 10-day course of treatment that propelled stock markets higher. Markets had fallen back last week after reports that the drug had failed a trial  but the company said preliminary results had shown that more than half of patients in both groups improved  and had been discharged from hospital by the 14th day after starting the treatment. Despite the encouraging signs  remdesivir is still some distance away from being available as a treatment for Covid-19. Donald Trump’s economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  said the Gilead reports were a positive for a US economy that experienced a sharp reversal of fortune between the turn of the year and the end of the first quarter. Strong growth in January and February had resulted in forecasts that the world’s biggest economy would grow at an annual pace of about 4% in the first three months of the year  but an upswing stretching back to the end of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago came to a halt in March. James Knightley  the chief international economist at ING bank  said: “After a strong January and February  a combination of Covid-19 containment measures and consumer fear meant activity collapsed in March.” The US publishes its growth figures in a different form to other countries  but the 4.8% annualised drop in gross domestic product means the economy shrank by a little over 1% between the fourth quarter or 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said worse was to come and predicted the US would contract by a further 10% in this quarter. “Following 10 years of continuous growth  the longest US economic expansion has ended. And  while the 4.8% annualised plunge in real GDP is the sharpest contraction since 2008  it will pale in comparison with the near-40% plunge in the second quarter.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab2c172c8cc4a5bb5e0030b8107f711016aefdc/0_0_5758_3453/master/5758.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84eb4c8cef4e4fc50a5499fa8bea4278 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Stock+markets%2CUS+economic+growth+and+recession%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CPharmaceuticals+industry%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CScience%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CWorld+news%2CFTSE%2CUS+news%2CUS+economy%2CGlobal+economy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/dixons-carphone-plans-drive-through-and-contactless-shops,business, Dixons Carphone plans drive-through and contactless shops, Retailer views Nordic outlets  which remain open  as model for UK stores post-lockdown, Shares in the retail group  which owns the Currys  PC World and Carphone Warehouse chains  rose by 16% on Wednesday after it reported a sales decline of just 3% in the five weeks to 25 April. There had been a surge in trading via its websites. Demand for home deliveries enabled the retailer to recover about two-thirds of sales lost in its UK stores  which are closed. Online sales jumped by 166% in the UK and Ireland  and by 16% overseas  as shoppers sought computers to cope with working from home  as well as breadmakers  gaming equipment and TVs for entertainment during the lockdown. Despite the relatively strong sales performance  the company  which permanently closed all 531 standalone branches of its Carphone Warehouse chain last month amid poor shop sales of mobile phones  is cancelling its dividend and has secured a £266m additional debt facility as it shores up finances to cope with the coronavirus crisis. Alex Baldock  the chief executive of Dixons Carphone  said: “We’re being prudent in conserving cash  have secured additional funding  and can plan for the future with confidence.” He said the sales performance had been strong in those countries where the group’s stores continued to be able to operate. “In the Nordics [Denmark and Sweden]  our stores continue to operate to high social distancing and hygiene standards  providing a successful blueprint for how our UK stores can safely reopen as soon as government so decides. And we’re innovating: launching live video shopping for online customers and contactless shopping in-store.” The group’s ShopLive personal shopping service connects customers with shop assistants at Currys PC World via a video link. Initially  customers browsing the Currys website will be invited to chat to store staff via a pop-up video link beside a limited range of products such as laptops  TVs  washing machines and fridges. Eventually the service is expected to enable live demonstrations of products  during which customers can ask questions. Other ideas in development include a drive-through pick-up point  so that shoppers can get access to their goods immediately without entering stores  and contactless shops  where only a small part of an existing outlet is open to the public while staff provide products and assistance from behind screens. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6559aaf8c1ba958b434c31eab3689d8cfd6cadfa/0_331_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3096ea7782b6ed87dc2bdcc73eec3fa3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Carphone+Warehouse%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CRetail+industry%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/next-warns-sales-will-fall-faster-and-steeper-than-expected-during-crisis,business, Next warns sales will fall 'faster and steeper' than expected in pandemic, Retailer cancels dividend and share buyback scheme ahead of projected 40% slump this year, The fashion and homewares retailer warned it could suffer losses of £150m – from a profit of almost £600m last year – as full-price sales collapse by up to 40%. The potential scenario outlined by Next on Wednesday is a significant worsening from the worst case of a 25% drop predicted by the group just last month. It said expectations had changed because of a bigger-than-expected 38% slump in sales in the three months to 26 April after having to close its stores and website for a period. It also believes it likely trading will continue to decline through the autumn and winter season. Simon Wolfson  the chief executive  said it was not clear when Next would be able to reopen stores. “There is no way that we or the government can know. No one knows what next week’s infection rates will be and there’s no comparable event to what we are experiencing at the moment that allows people to use the past to inform a prediction about the future. “Rather than bully the government to give information it can’t give we have to prepare for all eventualities.” Next confirmed it would not pay a dividend due in August and added it was also highly unlikely to pay one in January as much had changed since it last updated investors just over a month ago amid “unprecedented uncertainty” caused by the coronavirus outbreak. “We anticipate that it will take some time for customers to return to their normal shopping habits and that sales will be very subdued when trade commences ” the group said. “We believe that the effects of the coronavirus will be felt for longer than we first anticipated. The economic consequences and continued social distancing will mean that both retail sales and online sales will be disrupted even after full lockdown measures have been lifted.” The retailer stressed its finances were secure as “historic maintenance of healthy margins and high returns on capital have built a strong base from which to weather the storm”. To help it cope with the crisis  Next is raising £155m in cash with the sale and leaseback of three warehouses and its headquarters in Leicester. It has saved £290m by cancelling stock orders from suppliers and made £120m in other cost savings  including marketing and distribution. The company has also won approval for a government-backed emergency loan and furloughed more than 80% of staff under the government’s job retention scheme. Next said it was working on getting back to business  and has 70% of its ranges available online  after putting in place physical distancing measures at its warehouse. Overseas online operations are closed in all but two countries  Germany and Russia  but the company expects to begin reopening by the end of this week. The group is working on plans to reopen stores with physical distancing measures in place  once it is allowed to do so. Wolfson said Next had begun trialling measures such as till screens and one-way systems in one store and had ordered kit for other outlets. Next said large  out-of-town stores would be the first to open as they had the space to organise queuing systems similar to those used by supermarkets. The update from Next came as Dixons Carphone said it was also cancelling its dividend  although the electrical products retailer said its sales had fallen by just 3% in the five weeks to 25 April. A surge in online demand allowed the retailer to recover about two-thirds of sales lost in its closed UK stores. Online sales jumped by 166% in the UK and Ireland and by 16% overseas  as shoppers sought out computers to cope with working from home as well as breadmakers  gaming equipment and TVs for entertainment during the lockdown. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4c9abf48acd6423b809265ca7ca16cac7455285/0_107_4746_2847/master/4746.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04335320a59641894ccbcae34e18a345 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Next%2CBusiness%2CRetail+industry%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/odeon-bans-all-universal-pictures-films-as-studio-skips-cinema-releases,film, Odeon bans all Universal Pictures films as studio skips cinema releases, Fast & Furious maker to break with tradition and release some films direct to streaming services, Adam Aron  the chief executive of AMC Theaters  the world’s largest cinema chain operator and owner of Odeon  said the ban would apply to its 1 000 outlets worldwide when they reopened after the coronavirus lockdown. The bitter row follows comments made by NBCUniversal  trumpeting the success of the Trolls World Tour film. The company controls the Hollywood studio and is in turn owned by Sky’s parent company Comcast. The DreamWorks-made animated film is the most high-profile of a series of titles that Universal Pictures intended for cinema release but instead went straight to streaming. The film  released three weeks ago  has reportedly generated $100m (£80m) as a premium video-on-demand (PVOD) title  priced at $19.99  with 5m rentals on services such as Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from streaming services than cinema box office take  which means the film has made it the same amount of money as the first Trolls film did during its entire run in US cinemas. “The results for Trolls World Tour have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD ” said Jeff Shell  the chief executive of NBCUniversal  earlier this week. “As soon as theaters reopen  we expect to release movies on both formats.” The comments have incensed cinema owners who see the studios as using the coronavirus lockdown to test the sacrosanct tradition of the “theatrical window” that Netflix rails against. Cinemas have traditionally enjoyed being at the top of the pecking order for newly released films  with a three-month exclusivity period before they are released on other platforms such as pay-TV and DVD  in a strategy to maximise the value of every movie. Aron has fired off a letter to Universal Studios’ chair  Donna Langley  accusing the company of “breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies”. He said: “AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theaters in the United States  Europe or the Middle East. It also extends to any movie-maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us.” The studio intends to forge ahead with this tactic  announcing on Monday that Judd Apatow’s new Pete Davidson-led comedy The King of Staten Island would scrap its planned cinema release on 19 June and premiere on-demand instead. However  Universal has rescheduled most of its major films for cinema release later this year  such as the next instalments in the Minions and Purge franchises  as have the other major Hollywood studios. Universal Pictures responded to AMC saying that it would look beyond cinema premieres for titles only “when it makes sense”. “We absolutely believe in the theatrical experience and have made no statement to the contrary. As we stated earlier  going forward  we expect to release future films directly to theaters  as well as on PVOD when that distribution outlet makes sense ” the company said. “Our goal in releasing Trolls World Tour on PVOD was to deliver entertainment to people who are sheltering at home  while movie theaters and other forms of outside entertainment are unavailable.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a37cd97c1653829408099bc4bdbe9f94844e03/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b414c8ddeba59fccb7c94dcf17a2cf9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a72c7971a3f0019b8e8f92458b28ca56afff4c/0_201_5088_3052/master/5088.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e80ebaf3e899874d5c583e8686323dfb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa77aebcbf97bd12f605dafc44600dc91c0306e6/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=65ac367d5b289f684c8fbe2185578a9e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5850815e4d1ccdd09085bf3b0effa9225d35d1/0_1_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd55f5dc3fec419a1b7fd9f31b0e5606 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f4cf358eab27788900ae3abe46324be01a1f154/135_54_1844_1107/master/1844.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4aa0f27567e136feb5a048c958b87765 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Universal+Pictures%2CFilm+industry%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news%2CFilm%2CCulture%2CTechnology%2CTelevision%2CMedia https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/barclays-may-have-to-put-aside-45bn-to-cover-bad-debts-due-to-coronavirus,business, Barclays may have to put aside £4.5bn to cover bad debts due to coronavirus, Bank reports £2.1bn charge for first quarter as customers struggle to repay loans, The bank made a provision of £2.1bn to cover bad debts in the first quarter  driven by potential losses linked to the pandemic. The extra costs sent profits down by 38% to £913m  a bigger fall than analysts had expected. Barclays is forecasting a near-8% drop in UK economic growth for the full year  which is expected to result in a surge in loan defaults by both corporate and retail customers. It means Barclays could be forced to put aside up to £4.5bn to cover bad debts due to the outbreak in 2020  a spokesperson for the bank confirmed. Its chief executive  Jes Staley  said the pandemic’s impact was proving to be far worse than the 2008 financial crisis: “This is unprecedented territory that we’re in  and having lived and been on JPMorgan’s operating committee in the 2008-09 crisis  this is beyond that by some measure.” Barclays said £1.2bn of the first quarter charge reflected “initial estimates of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic ” though expected losses were partially offset by stimulus measures announced by government and central banks in the UK and US in recent weeks. The bank was also affected by a plunge in oil prices because of the dramatic fall in demand during the outbreak  as well as a £400m charge linked to defaults by a single unnamed corporate client. It is understood that the loss was linked to Finablr – the company that owns the foreign exchange bureau Travelex. Finablr was forced to put itself up for sale after suffering a cyber-attack at the start of the year and was then hit by a drop in demand for foreign exchange services due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. While Barclays has been waiving charges and fees for customers impacted by the outbreak  the bank’s finance chief  Tushar Morzaria  warned it would start seeing the full effects of the pandemic on results in the second quarter. He said the bank’s consumer business was expected to take a hit  and that the drop in spending levels would also impact income from debit and credit cards. Lenders such as Barclays have been criticised for how they handled small-business customers seeking government-backed coronavirus business interruption loans scheme (CBILS)  by initially asking for personal guarantees or being too slow in approving applications from desperate customers. Staley admitted that some mistakes were made but said staff were working flat-out on the programme. The bank has so far processed 3 760 CBILS loans worth £737m. The latest industry figures  which will be updated on Thursday  showed UK banks had issued a total 16 624 loans worth £2.8bn. “It’s never been done before by our customers and clients. It’s never been done before by the government and regulators and the banks  so it’s complex. I’m sure we’ve made mistakes as everybody has as we’ve rolled this out. We’re putting our people under enormous strain  because you can imagine  as requests come  it’s quite desperate ” the chief executive said. Barclays is the latest bank to reveal the costs linked to the pandemic. On Tuesday  HSBC revealed it could end up setting aside $11bn (£8.8bn) to cover loan losses for 2020  after the pandemic hit its main markets across Asia and Europe. Standard Chartered also revealed a $962m (£776m) loan loss charge on Wednesday that pushed first-quarter pre-tax profits down 29% to $886m. Staley said: “Despite all the challenges we face as a consequence of Covid-19  I am confident Barclays will emerge from this pandemic well placed to continue to serve our customers and clients  the communities and economies in which we operate  and our shareholders.” Barclays did not provide an update on a UK regulatory investigation into Staley  which centres on whether he was transparent enough over his relationship with the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67db87d9300449cbcced86676e3c47bd4f75f5bd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca534b9d9c83e1d2dc04bc212d3e118d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Barclays%2CBanking%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

The depression occurred far out at sea  south-west of Mexico  and didn’t make landfall. However  this is the earliest ever recorded formation of a tropical depression in the ocean basin since records began in 1966. Another record was broken this month when Cuba recorded its highest temperature since records began. On 12 April temperatures reached 39.3C in the town of Veguitas. This was mainly due to a strong high pressure system and light winds allowing for heat to become trapped at the surface. The previous record had been 39.1 degrees  recorded last year on 30 June. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344b9fd772aec6a1646881ab431ccca9360eb82f/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4cbc81893e809c0c759f6e6585e2f4ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Tornadoes%2CMississippi%2CCuba%2CClimate+change https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant,business, British Airways plans to make up to 12 000 staff redundant, BA boss says more than one in four jobs could go as coronavirus causes global collapse in air travel, The airline’s chief executive  Alex Cruz  told BA’s 42 000 staff on Tuesday night that the company “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future” and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut. Cruz said the UK’s flag carrier airline  which has placed 22 600 people on the government’s furlough scheme  “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely”. “Yesterday  British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline  like so many other businesses up and down the country  is that there is no ‘normal’ any longer ” Cruz said in a letter to staff . “We are a strong  well-managed business that has faced into  and overcome  many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves  too.” Cruz said the airline and its parent company International Airlines Group  had informed the government and its trade unions about its plans to cut jobs  and would begin a consultation period with staff and unions immediately. “This has been a difficult message to write and one I never thought I would need to send ” Cruz said. “I know how tight-knit the BA family is  and how concerned you will be  not just for yourself but for your colleagues  too. We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.” IAG said it had plunged to a loss of €535m (£465m) in the first three months of this year – with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of €135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of €1.3bn – the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed. IAG said BA had been hit hardest  with other airlines in the group – Iberia  Aer Lingus and Vueling – feeling less impact. Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton  the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa  said staff were devastated by the “bolt out of the blue” news and that the union would fight for every job. “BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12 000 possible job losses in British Airways ” he said. BA  he added  had “said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.” The leader of the Unite union described BA’s decision as heartless  and a “stab in the back”  saying it was “entirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis”. Len McCluskey said: “To reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement  is irresponsible  dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.” Nadine Houghton  national officer of GMB  the union for British Airways ground staff  said: “If the 12 000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members. “We believed we had reached some relative  albeit temporary  respite for them following the agreement to furlough 80% of BA’s staff – now this. “I know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12 000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.” The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule. When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures – which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard – will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before. The global airlines trade association  Iata  has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (£240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk. “This is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive ” Alexandre de Juniac  Iata’s director general  said last week. “Governments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won’t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. “We could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief  many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.” Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans. Germany’s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection  as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through €1m of cash every hour  and has warned it will have 10 000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator. The budget airline Norwegian has warned that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a £500m emergency loan. Virgin Australia collapsed into administration last week. Easyjet has borrowed £600m from the government under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility  allowing it to survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn. In a statement to the stock market  IAG said: “In light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years  British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme. “The proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways’ employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12 000 of them.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7bfa9746a2c50766c336b277c936779d101433d/0_15_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4055e720d1e7fac491906f90e715c91f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b22950fb1e6b4ab0f1747e0df75ac3011af24c/0_105_4160_2495/master/4160.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=39b35d8d2fcce20e99c34cfd51b43df8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97d6c94c279dfa04f568028d3c7b0d8c1ea711d/157_335_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3687ba84db0523e1159a5f49079f5d0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d3945d590beb1310b892783c2764fb3b6982f6/0_89_2508_1504/master/2508.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4696d1e674aa5de064680d12341c0b3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36f3fec3a2b771d5851a87c69f683a1c6679126/0_135_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=134702c28957acfcef72db486c521105 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=British+Airways%2CTravel+%26+leisure%2CBusiness%2CAirline+industry%2CInternational+Airlines+Group%2CJob+losses%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/extra-18000-cancer-patients-in-england-could-die-in-next-year-study,society, Coronavirus crisis could lead to 18 000 more cancer deaths  experts warn, Analysis models impact over next year of delays in getting diagnosis and treatment, Cancer experts claim that an extra 6 270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus  and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17 915. That is an increase of 20% on the 89 576 deaths among cancer patients recorded annually in England  according to the latest available statistics. The UK hospital death toll from coronavirus stands at 21 678  and more than 4 300 people have died in care homes in the past fortnight  bringing the total to more than 26 000 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic took hold in Britain. The new analysis sheds light on some of the wider health impacts of the pandemic. Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings as extremely worrying and said cancer should not become “the forgotten C” during the coronavirus crisis. NHS England has launched a campaign urging people with symptoms of any potentially serious illness to seek help in the normal way by visiting A&E  a GP or dialling 999. Urgent referrals by GPs for cancer tests have fallen by 76% and appointments for chemotherapy by 60% since the pandemic arrived in February despite NHS England insisting cancer treatment “should continue unaffected”. The health service hopes to resume cancer operations this week but faces a large backlog. The new research  from University College London (UCL) and Data-Can  a health data research hub for cancer diagnosis and treatment in the UK  is the first to quantify the potential impact of the NHS delaying many forms of cancer treatment  including diagnostic tests and operations  and people not wanting to risk going into hospital in case they become infected. It is based on data from the health records of more than 3.5 million patients in England. While some of the projected additional deaths will be among people with cancer who contract Covid-19  others will occur because diagnosis was late or treatment such as chemotherapy was delayed  the researchers conclude. “Our findings demonstrate the serious potential for unintended consequences of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic  which may negatively impact on patients with cancer and other underlying health conditions ” said Dr Alvina Lai  a lead author of the study and a lecturer in health data analytics at UCL’s institute of health informatics. The NHS should recognise patients affected as being particularly vulnerable and manage their care to reduce the risk to their health  Lai added. Prof Peter Johnson  NHS England’s top cancer doctor  said on Wednesday that people with possible signs of cancer who delay seeking care could face serious consequences. He said they should have symptoms such as a lump or new mole checked out as soon as possible. Patients can have cancer surgery at one of the NHS’s “Covid-free cancer hubs” already operating in 19 areas of England  he added. Almost eight in 10 of the extra fatalities will be people recently diagnosed with cancer who also have at least one other long-term illness  such as heart problems  high blood pressure  obesity or diabetes  the NHS-funded study concluded. Prof Mark Lawler  of Queen’s University Belfast and Data-Can’s scientific lead  said: “The results are concerning. We believe countries need to rapidly understand how the emergency is affecting cancer outcomes  otherwise we risk adding cancer and other underlying health conditions to the escalating death toll of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Prof Harry Hemingway  a senior author and the director of UCL’s institute of health informatics  said: “The overall impact of the Covid-19 emergency on deaths in cancer patients could be substantial. There are many factors operating here including rapid changes to diagnosis and treatment protocols  social distancing measures  changes in people’s behaviour in seeking medical attention and [the] economic impact of Covid-19  as well as deaths due to Covid-19 infection.” One patient with bowel cancer told the Guardian that he had had a CT scan but his planned colonoscopy – a diagnostic procedure – at a hospital in south-west England had been postponed for an unspecified period because the hospital’s endoscopy department had closed until the Covid-19 crisis eases. “I am totally gutted to think I’ve been chucked on the pile in favour of coronavirus victims. For all I know they are giving me a death sentence [by] not looking at my case ” he said. Another person said their mother’s surgery to remove a 3cm bladder tumour had been delayed for up to eight weeks because her hospital’s urology department had been shut as part of its preparations for Covid-19 cases. “This is worse than any nightmare I might ever have imagined in my darkest hour ” the relative said. Macmillan’s chief executive  Lynda Thomas  said: “This research shows the possible extent of the direct and collateral damage caused by coronavirus on the health of our nation and to the lives of people living with conditions like cancer. It’s extremely worrying that we are likely to see an increase in deaths of people newly diagnosed with cancer. “We are calling on all governments to stop cancer becoming the forgotten C and urgently ensure cancer services are getting everything they need to recover and catch up as quickly as possible from the disruption of the pandemic. This means having the right staff  protective equipment and testing to deliver safe care.” Genevieve Edwards  the chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK  warned that unless NHS cancer services had the resources they needed to tackle the backlog of care  “the effects on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer will be felt for years to come”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5824e5b626a5c450a4a599e8b846c7ae800d3c4a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d937b38c9680093303a375ea2b4d66a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Cancer%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/28/guardian-tops-poll-of-national-papers-for-coronavirus-coverage,media, Guardian tops poll of national papers for coronavirus coverage, Twice as many Britons feel outlet is doing a ‘good job’ compared with nearest rival  amid record traffic to its website, According to the research  twice as many Britons said they felt the Guardian was doing a “good job” covering the pandemic compared with the Times  its nearest rival. The Guardian’s website was also one of the most-read sources for information on the outbreak  second only to BBC News. This fits with internal traffic statistics which show the Guardian has consistently reached record audiences over the last two months  while also seeing a surge in reader contributions to fund its journalism. Other outlets fared less well but the Sun and the Mail were the only national newspapers where more people felt they were doing a “bad job” than approved of their reporting on the pandemic. The survey by YouGov for the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute also found that the BBC’s output continues to dominate online news consumption in the UK  with 36% of the population saying they had turned to the public service broadcaster’s website for coronavirus coverage. Around 16% said they had visited the Guardian’s website  with Sky News and MailOnline in joint third place on 9%. TV broadcasters continue to outrank all national newspapers in overall trust ratings and audience levels  aided by their far wider reach. The figures also show broader concerns about low trust in the media  with the population more approving of how the government and the Conservative party have handled the crisis than how the media has covered it. Around a quarter of the population feel news outlets have exaggerated the severity of the crisis. All news websites have seen record audiences in recent months as people flock to mainstream sources of information in order to find out the latest updates and advice. However  commercial news outlets face an uncertain future as the collapse in the advertising market – and the fall in print newspaper sales that in effect subsidise many free online news sites – has destroyed their finances. The government is adopting an increasingly aggressive tone towards critical news outlets  echoing its pre-pandemic attempts to take on the BBC and Channel 4. Although this stance was put on hold as the coronavirus spread  it has responded firmly to recent criticism in national newspapers and has introduced a question from a member of the public at its daily press conferences to break up the dominance of the established media outlets. There are signs that the initial unprecedented levels of news readership seen during the early days of the pandemic have started to soften  with growing numbers of people telling the Reuters Institute survey they were trying to switch off from the news altogether as the lockdown continues. Separate research published on Tuesday by the media regulator Ofcom backed this up  concluding that the number of people checking the news obsessively had fallen substantially  while 30% of people were actively seeking to avoid news about the pandemic. This could be a potential issue for the government if it needs to send messages about changing lockdown conditions to the population. Ofcom also found that around half the population had encountered disinformation suggesting the coronavirus pandemic was linked to the rollout of 5G mobile phone technology  although it did not ask respondents whether they believed the conspiracy theory  which has led to some people burning down telecoms equipment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35146af4c173d4d6694e8d443b8741a26ceb8d8/0_110_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d0e998b915b71ff94f5b6e6e143c49c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Media%2CThe+Guardian%2CNational+newspapers%2CNewspapers%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CBBC%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/refuges-from-domestic-violence-running-out-of-space-mps-hear,society, Refuges from domestic violence running out of space  MPs hear, Dame Vera Baird warns select committee Covid-19 lockdown is leading to ‘perfect storm’, A “perfect storm” of problems is in danger of overwhelming support services for those trying to escape violent and abusive partners  Dame Vera Baird QC warned members of the House of Commons justice select committee. She also said on Tuesday there was evidence of a newer trend  of older children – principally teenagers – attacking their parents amid frustration about being unable to go outside. The former solicitor general reinforced concerns about the rapid rise in domestic violence cases during lockdown. Earlier this month  she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes  although the sample size was small. “There was always going to be an epidemic [of domestic violence] inside this pandemic ” Baird said. “It should have been flagged up a lot earlier. There have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to [family] homes [to investigate] because they have been told  inappropriately  they haven’t got personal protective equipment (PPE). “Ministers are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos. It’s imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence. Refuges are full  others are in lockdown because of coronavirus [so can’t take in new victims].” There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April  compared to 170 on the same day last year. The Women’s Aid Annual Survey 2017  carried out on a single day  found there were 3 557 women with 3 919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England. “There’s very little accommodation ” Baird said. “Universities and hotels have been offering help” but they cannot provide the specialist services required  she added. An intergovernmental group involving both the Ministry of Justice and Home Office should be established to deal with the problem  Baird urged  with the victims’ commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved. A survey published by Women’s Aid on Tuesday found that over two-thirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown; 72% said their abuser has more control over their life since Covid-19. Over three-quarters (78%) of victims  the survey found  reported that Covid-19 has made it harder for them to leave their abuser. One survivor said: “I wanted to leave the relationship. However  since Covid-19 and the lockdown coming into effect  it has made it harder to leave. I am a key worker who is around Covid positive patients  so I don’t feel like I can go home and stay with my parents.” Womens’ Aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic. There were about 300 refuges in England and Wales in 2017 but funding has been cut. Lucy Hadley  campaigns and policy manager at Women’s Aid  said: “Demand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the Covid-19 crisis. Sixty-four per cent of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-19  and the number of refuge bed spaces in England is 30% below the number recommended by the Council of Europe. These life-saving services are now on the frontline of the response to the pandemic. “They are now facing staff shortages  lost income  challenges in managing social distancing within communal accommodation  and restrictions on resettling women and children into long-term housing. This simply means the spaces we have are even less accessible to survivors.” Baird also told the justice committee that there is “some suggestion of abuse by older children on parents” during the coronavirus lockdown. “This is a newer kind of domestic abuse which is probably suggestive of kids wanting to go out and not being allowed to. We are talking teenagers.” Calls to domestic violence helplines have rocketed  she said  although complaints to the police have not gone up commensurately. “There are real worries about access to any help if you are locked down with the perpetrator in the next room.” Labour’s shadow home secretary  Nick Thomas-Symonds MP  has criticised the government’s announcement that it is providing just over £3m in emergency aid. “That is why Labour has set out an urgent £75m plan to fund charities working to protect people suffering from domestic abuse ” he said. In the Commons  the new attorney general  Suella Braverman  said the extra funds being made available would help frontline services. She reminded those in danger that “they will not be breaking the law if they flee their home [during the lockdown] and seek help outside”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117892258bb3aa68a65991de90ec46c62bc14c2b/961_466_4646_2788/master/4646.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05c4f1db223c4eddc931960157b208c3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Domestic+violence%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CSociety%2CHouse+of+Commons%2CPolitics%2CFamily%2CChildren%2CParents+and+parenting https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots,world, Pentagon releases three UFO videos taken by US navy pilots, The previously leaked videos were declassified to ‘clear up any misconceptions’ on whether they were real, The grainy videos  which the Pentagon says depict “unexplained aerial phenomena”  were previously leaked  with some believing they show alien UFOs. The Pentagon said it released the footage to “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos”  a statement on the Department of Defense website said. “After a thorough review  the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems  and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena ” the statement said. The videos had been “circulating in the public domain after unauthorized releases in 2007 and 2017”  the statement said  adding that “the aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‘unidentified’”. The three videos show what the pilots saw during training flights in 2004 and 2015. Two of the videos were published by the New York Times in 2017. The other video was released by the To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science group  a media and private science organization. The 2004 video shows an incident that happened 100 miles out over the Pacific  according to the New York Times. Two navy fighter pilots found an oblong object hovering above the water. It then flew quickly away. “It accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen ” one of pilots  Cmdr David Fravor  told the NYT. The 2015 videos show objects moving quickly through the sky  one of them seeming to spin in the air. “Look at that thing  dude!” a pilot says. “It’s rotating!” The release of the videos by the Pentagon adds to the legitimacy of the videos and will spur more speculation that humans have recently interacted with extraterrestrials. The navy has guidelines for reporting UFO sightings. In response  the former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid  from Nevada  tweeted the three videos “only scratches the surface of research and materials available”. Discussion about the videos and extraterrestrials have persisted throughout the upper echelons of American politics in recent years. During the earlier half of the 2016 presidential campaign Hillary Clinton said if elected president she would release files on potential UFO sightings. Her campaign chairman  John Podesta  has displayed an interest in the subject as well. Last June  Donald Trump fueled a new round of discussion in political circles about extraterrestrials when he said he had been briefed on sightings of unidentified aircraft by US navy pilots. “I think it’s probably – I want them to think whatever they think ” Trump said to ABC News. “They do say  and I’ve seen  and I’ve read  and I’ve heard. And I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they’re seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particular.” In September an internet hoax resulted in 75 people arriving at Area 51 – the infamous secret military facility in the Nevada desert that is rumored to house evidence of extraterrestrials – in a project to storm the base to hunt for evidence of aliens. However  the invitation to storm Area 51 sparked festivals all across Nevada. A local sheriff estimated 1 500 people attended those festivals  underscoring the pop culture interest in evidence of extraterrestrial life. In 2018 the Irish Aviation Authority investigated a sighting of a reported UFO by commercial airline pilots. The IAA said it would investigate the sightings but a spokesman for the organization said it was unlikely that the objects were beings from another planet. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UFOs%2CUS+national+security%2CUS+news%2CSpace https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/one-way-shambles-how-york-is-trying-to-keep-its-narrow-streets-safe,uk-news, One-way Shambles: how York is trying to keep its narrow streets safe, City known for its labyrinthine lanes draws up ‘confidence charter’ to reassure visitors, One idea is the introduction of a one-way system for pedestrians  which would stop tourists rubbing up against each other in streets that in the 14th century allowed the Black Death to spread so rapidly that half the population was wiped out one summer. The measure is part of a “confidence charter” proposed by the York Retail Forum to give visitors peace of mind when they return after the lockdown is lifted. “Obviously we have lots of narrow streets and you can’t keep the necessary distance away from other people if you have people going in both directions ” said Phil Pinder  who chairs the forum. He runs the Potions Cauldron  an exotic drinks emporium on the Shambles  which is said to have been an inspiration for the fictional Diagon Alley  the magical merchant market from Harry Potter. “Our shop is 2.5 metres by five metres  and so you can already see social distancing is hard. But outside my shop the width of the street is only about three metres ” said Pinder. “We had a meeting at the retail forum last week and we agreed that narrow streets have got to be one-way. When everyone is walking in different directions it’s difficult to get from one end to the other  so we are looking to the council to put up cones  maybe even metal barriers  and signs to show people clearly where they should walk.” Other ideas include installing on-street hand sanitiser dispensers and a promotion of what Pinder calls the “Yorkshire spirit” – a can-do attitude that prides pragmatism above personal liberty. This may encourage visitors to leave their selfies for another time. “People are always stopping outside our shop to take a selfie but it might be that we will have to ask them not to for a while  to keep everybody moving ” said Pinder. He is already considering closing his shop to browsers  serving them instead through what is known locally as a “Yorkshire window” – a horizontal sliding sash hatch  seen only in the oldest listed buildings in the county. Rachael Maskell  the MP for York Central  welcomed the one-way idea. “It does make sense in that York is full of narrow little snickets  so I can see why you can’t have people go two ways down them. You can’t socially distance on the Shambles or when walking on the city walls. I think it’s a sensible idea but it might be a challenge to control it ” she said. She believes York is at an “economic crossroads” and that the pause in business offers an opportunity to rethink an economy that works more for the 8.4 million annual visitors than many of its 200 000 inhabitants. “The whole economy of the city is going to have to be reset and it’s an opportunity to do that because there has been a high level of under-employment and low productivity spread across the retail  hospitality and tourist sectors and we have a deficit of good-quality  skilled jobs in the city ” she said. “We are at an economic crossroads and we can’t just say ‘lockdown’s over  here you go’. We really do need proper investment in the right places in the economy  otherwise it will just fall over.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86da62daf5d80be1a62d4c7867245360bc5d3fc3/0_435_5460_3277/master/5460.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8efb7bd269657719e515d21a398a1985 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39be1fcd5d291c3d4510226cc426710bc2fc5ddc/0_187_4764_2860/master/4764.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1e4b7805882d1c95c5f14ce4bac631f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2b776809fe8a955f9173ba77c5d8d02a994519/232_447_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc41a6a054d0ac869d878b17e48e1e25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=York%2CYorkshire%2CNorth+of+England%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/gp-coronavirus-no-ppe-guilty-angry,society, I'm a GP who got coronavirus because I had no PPE. I feel guilty but also angry, We were left unprotected and felt like we were going into a battlefield. I don’t think our profession will ever be the same, All I can feel is guilt. Guilt for my colleagues at the practice for adding to their workload. Guilt for the under-protected doctor in A&E who saw me when I became so breathless I needed to go to hospital. And mostly guilty for my children who watched me struggling to breathe and didn’t know if they were going to see me again. Last week the registrar who helped train me died. It breaks my heart because you can’t get that knowledge back  or recreate that person. And for every doctor  there is a family beside them. I don’t think as a profession we are ever going to be the same again. As well as guilt I feel anger that we were so unprotected. Early on  we felt like we were going into the battlefield from the trenches in the first world war. It was very frightening. I’d like Matt Hancock to stand in A&E all day and examine patients in a plastic apron and gloves and masks. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is not just vital for those in the intensive care unit and high dependancy unit. It needs to be available in other areas: A&E  ambulance services  GP practices and care homes  to name a few. We are all exposed to the virus time and time again. The advice as to who should be protected changes daily  but it is always behind the curve – as was the guidance of the symptoms and signs of coronavirus. It was obvious after the February half-term holiday that Covid-19 would hit England. Countless families returned from holidays all over Europe  yet the guidelines for testing remained the same. I have friends in Italy who were panicking about us because we weren’t reacting quickly enough. Doctors in Italy were saying ‘Test  test  test’. The World Health Organization was telling us to test. But nothing changed. People were advised to go through NHS 111  which ironically was how I ended up with coronavirus. Doctors were wearing whatever PPE they had to see patients with Covid-19 symptoms  but to begin with they were just a cough and a temperature. Patients with sore throats and headaches weren’t flagged as a risk  so I saw them entirely unprotected. In late February I had an influx of children with sore throats and headaches  and patients who “forgot” they had been in Spain or “only flew through Milan”. If I could do that week again I would still see every patient  but insist on PPE for everyone. By the end of the week I had mild symptoms of coronavirus. As an NHS doctor  the advice I was given? Seven days isolation  no testing. Luckily my seven days ended on a Friday when I felt well once more. However  like countless others  day nine was a sudden change as I struggled to breathe and my temperature soared. Once more I followed guidelines and called NHS 111. They told me to contact my GP. The fear I felt only made my breathing worse. I knew the guidelines for hospital admission and knew I had reached this point – if I had been my own patient I would have called 999 for an ambulance – but I couldn’t get past the feeling that others needed the doctors more than me. By the beginning of the third week I was still struggling to speak sentences and with immense pressure from a colleague I went to hospital. My husband drove me there. Leaving my children was the hardest  most traumatic moment I have ever experienced. Knowing that my job had put them in a position where they could lose their mother made me feel so selfish. The staff in my local A&E were very unprotected. It’s ironic that the public is told to keep a two-metre distance and yet healthcare professionals are protected in a flimsy surgical mask  plastic gloves and a pathetic apron. I tried to make them keep away from me because I obviously had coronavirus but it is impossible to maintain a safe distance and take observations or bloods from a patient. My CT showed widespread Covid-19. I was not tested so I don’t count  like numerous others in the country’s total of positive tests. I was there all day and they wanted to keep me in  but I cried and told them I wanted to be at home. They only let me leave because I’m a doctor. I was more ill than I’ve ever been; I might well have died. My oldest son doesn’t want me to go back to work because he thinks it’s too dangerous. But I’m desperate to get back. I hate knowing my colleagues are still in the firing line  fighting  and thinking I’m not doing anything to help them.

28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/calls-include-bus-drivers-60k-payouts-coronavirus-deaths,world, All key workers should get bereaved family payments  say unions, Call to extend £60 000 payouts for NHS staff relatives to others on frontline such as bus drivers, The trade union Unite has reported that 27 of its bus driver members have died after contracting the disease. Concerns have been raised about the financial protections offered to their relatives and those of other workers running essential services in direct contact with the public. On Monday the health secretary  Matt Hancock  announced that the families of NHS and social care workers who died after contracting the disease in the course of their duties would receive the payment from the taxpayer. He said the government was also looking at “which other groups of key workers” had suffered on the frontline and “don’t have a scheme already in place”. Bus drivers and their families said transport workers’ exclusion from the life assurance scheme was another example of them being “chronically overlooked” during the pandemic. One driver who has worked on London buses for a decade said omitting them “tells us we are not that important”  adding that the decision reminded him of the 2012 Olympics when they were excluded from bonus payments. “Back then bus drivers were not originally included in a £500 bonus to certain workers to help with the extra million people coming into the city for the Olympics. We had to threaten strike action to get the same treatment as everyone else ” said the driver  who is a trade unionist and transport activist. “This exclusion  however  cuts far more given all the colleagues we have lost. They were and we are frontline essential workers who take NHS and care home staff to their jobs every day.” Unite said most bus drivers who had died were in London  with others in Birmingham  Bristol and north-west England. It said £60 000 was not enough to cover all the expenses of those left behind. The union’s national officer for passenger transport  Bobby Morton  called for the payout scheme to be extended to all frontline workers and increased to £100 000 for each family. Elisabeth Hill  whose husband drives a bus on a busy west London route  criticised the exclusion. She said: “This is yet another example of legions of ordinary workers like bus drivers getting chronically overlooked. Despite the lionisation of NHS workers  other individuals who risk their lives doing essential work are still largely seen as low status and therefore irrelevant.” Hill  who has previously voiced her concerns over her husband’s fears for his life  cited several examples of the dangers and abuse her husband still faced at work  including a man who coughed on a bus while shouting “coronavirus”. “Who knows if he did or not have Covid but it was pretty appalling behaviour ” she said. Meanwhile  unions representing workers keeping other vital services such as supermarkets and prisons running during the crisis said they would also ask if the life assurance payout would be extended. The shopworkers’ union Usdaw said while it was not in dispute that healthcare staff should receive the benefit  it would be asking the government if it had plans to extend the scheme to its members. A spokesperson said: “We very much regard our members working in supermarkets as being key workers – they’re providing an essential service in difficult circumstances and clearly they’re worried about contracting Covid-19.” Last week a survey published by the union revealed a third of the workers it represents had been threatened by customers and 62% had experienced verbal abuse during lockdown. It said many of the incidents occurred when shop assistants asked people to adhere to physical distancing measures. The prison workers’ union POA said it had written to the justice secretary  Robert Buckland  to ask if the scheme would be rolled out to prison staff. So far six workers have died from Covid-19  and more than 2 000 prisoners in England and Wales could be infected with coronavirus. A spokesperson said POA understood that the government would be considering other frontline workers for the scheme and it hoped prison workers would be among them. The Department of Health and Social Care said the government recognised the important contribution of all key workers in the fight against coronavirus. A spokesperson said the scheme was targeted at frontline NHS and care workers because of the “heightened risks they are facing when working in environments where they are providing care to coronavirus patients and patients with suspected coronavirus”. The government defended the £60 000 payment as “of comparable size to the death-in-service lump sum that would be payable through the NHS pension scheme to the next of kin of an average NHS staff member”. It said the payment was in addition to any death benefit purchased through the pension scheme. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8463073f0b28f8e390a95b17afadd1f179e93de7/0_241_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9bde8f9a3f36d320fab9dd0f941dd06f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Transport%2CRetail+industry%2CPrisons+and+probation%2CTrade+unions%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/ministers-split-over-coronavirus-advice-on-wearing-face-masks,world, Ministers split over coronavirus advice on wearing face masks, Matt Hancock expresses scepticism about any change to UK-wide guidance, Hancock expressed his scepticism about changing the UK-wide advice in the daily No 10 press conference on Tuesday  emphasising that physical distancing was a much greater priority. However  Whitehall sources said the discussion on the issue was still live among ministers  even though the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) presented its verdict on the issue to the cabinet almost a week ago  which is understood to have advised there was little evidence masks reduce the spread of infection in the community. One government source said there was still clear concern among some ministers about changing the UK advice at this stage  when people with symptoms are being advised to stay at home anyway. “There is a worry in government is that we don’t want to do anything to lessen the impact of masks for healthcare workers. The risk is that you end up with people in the NHS without masks. We are being very cautious about it. There are people in government who obviously are more and less enthusiastic about the idea ” the source said. However  some ministers are persuaded of the idea that people might feel more confident about going back to work if they are told to wear cloth coverings on public transport and in enclosed work spaces  which could help reopen the economy. The British Medical Association has also called on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory. On Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon announced new non-mandatory guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to achieve  for example while shopping or using public transport. The Scottish first minister said she had taken advice from Sage  as well as her own chief medical officer  before making the decision to advise the use of masks “in limited circumstances”. Sturgeon said one of the reasons she had issued the guidance now was because people were increasingly wearing masks when they left the house and she did not want this to make individuals feel “invincible’ or distract from adherence to existing physical distancing and stay-at-home guidance. She told reporters at her daily media briefing “all governments across the UK are considering this and it’s not for me to speak to them”  insisting there was no “divide or split” between them on the matter. Asked about the issue later at the No 10 press briefing  Hancock said: “UK government advice hasn’t changed  not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing  as opposed to the weak science on face masks. “There is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. That is the absolute priority in terms of the message to the public. The social distancing and staying at home is the thing that’s helping to save lives. That is the number one thing.” Professor Dame Angela McLean  the UK deputy chief scientific adviser  confirmed that Sage recommended that there was “weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection going from somebody who is infected to the people around them”. McLean said: “Under our current circumstances  anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home ... but we are also concerned that some people are infected who don’t have symptoms  or maybe don’t have symptoms yet  and that is the reason that Sage has put so much effort into looking at this question ” she said. “But the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small  and we have passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d90c7052e422b1b8f1bb91f71617f8ddfa4658/0_156_4783_2871/master/4783.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f172a5c9b454b9168c1491d639feb58 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CScotland%2CUK+news%2CNicola+Sturgeon%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPolitics%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/the-questions-no-10-needs-to-answer-over-covid-19-response,world, The questions No 10 needs to answer over Covid-19 response, From lockdown to PPE  the government is under pressure to provide more clarity, There are huge questions about the secrecy surrounding the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  the crucial body advising Boris Johnson on the UK’s coronavirus response. MPs  academics and medical professionals want a detailed list of who sits on it  their disciplines  minutes of its twice weekly meetings and  most importantly  more documents showing the basis on which they are making decisions about the lockdown. Five weeks ago  the government published a tranche of scientific papers showing the possible effects of the virus and social distancing measures. But nothing more has been forthcoming on the impact of the lockdown. The Guardian’s publication last week of a list of many attendees  including the prime minister’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings  fuelled calls for transparency. Sir Patrick Vallance  the chief scientific adviser  has now promised that a membership list of participants would be published with their permission and the government also says it is planning to release more scientific papers in the coming days. Politicians from Tory grandees to opposition leaders are growing impatient with the government’s refusal to set out an exit strategy. In particular  they have been pressing for information on the economic impact of the measures so far  what this means for wider public health  rising domestic abuse  child abuse  children’s educational outcomes and other potential negative consequences. There was hope that the prime minister’s return to Downing Street might mean a roadmap out of the lockdown is published this week  but No 10 suggests this is unlikely to happen until just before the review date of 7 May. Many ideas have been floated in the press on opening the economy – from friends and family bubbles and socially distanced schools to which sectors may be allowed to return to work first. However  No 10 is remaining officially tight-lipped about the options  insisting that the public supports a lockdown until the spread is suppressed and the risk of a second peak is reduced. Boris Johnson may  however  release some information about the current status of the spread of the virus and how much further the UK has to go before easing restrictions after a cabinet meeting on Thursday. It is still unclear how many people are dying of coronavirus  the exact age profile and the locations of hotspots. The main criticism is that the daily death toll from coronavirus published by the Department of Health and Social Care only includes hospital deaths and wide age brackets  after a 29-hour time lag. The Office for National Statistics is now regularly releasing details for overall excess mortality with a few days’ time lag  which gives a wider picture of deaths in the community  both directly and indirectly related to the coronavirus crisis. However  there are still no real-time figures for deaths in specific settings from confirmed or likely coronavirus  such as care homes and households. This is set to change  after Matt Hancock  the health secretary  said daily deaths in care homes and the community would be published each day from Wednesday. There is also an incomplete picture of infection numbers because of the patchy situation with testing  with no widespread community monitoring. Some reports suggest there are still 350 000 infected people in the community but that is not an officially published figure. Ministers have been repeating huge figures for distribution of PPE  saying a billion pieces have been sent out since the crisis began across tens of thousands of sites. But the BBC’s Panorama accused the government of fiddling the numbers by counting each glove as an item  rather than pairs of gloves  and including paper towels and cleaning equipment  which are not protective clothing. Furthermore  No 10 has not come up with “burn rate” figures –how much PPE is needed and being used each day – so the huge numbers for items distributed have no context. Labour has repeatedly pointed to the “mismatch” between ministers claiming there are no shortages and the situation on the ground  where medics complain of having to manufacture makeshift protection  reuse items or go without. Ministers have been providing daily figures for testing capacity  actual tests  and people on whom tests have been performed. But they have failed to breakdown the types of people tested  including how many patients  care residents  hospital workers  care workers and other key workers are being tested and where in the country. Critics have asked for more information on why the number of tests being carried out do not match the capacity for testing  with many people unable or unwilling to travel for miles when unwell to drive-through testing centres. There is also ambiguity around the millions of antibody tests bought by the government  with a lack of clarity about how many different types are being tested  how much they cost  where they come from and how accurate they have proved so far. Ministers have been considering ordering a large batch from British developers of a test but there have been conflicting reports about whether they are reliable enough for home use. On Tuesday  Hancock announced a huge expansion of the eligibility criteria for coronavirus testing  with over-65s and those who work outside the home now able to get tested for coronavirus as long as they have symptoms. Moreover  tests will be available even without symptoms for all NHS staff  hospital patients  care home workers and their elderly residents. The now-notorious Exercise Cygnus was a pandemic preparation project carried out four years ago  which showed the the UK was woefully underprepared for a global outbreak of a new virus. Whistleblowers revealed a huge number of shortcomings were identified including low stockpiles of PPE  not enough ventilators  and inadequate hospital capacity. However  ministers are refusing to declassify and publish the report  with Dominic Raab  the foreign secretary  claiming on Sunday that he could not remember whether he had seen it or not. Hancock insisted on Tuesday that he had received assurances from officials that “everything appropriate to do was done” following the report’s recommendations but there is still no commitment to see it published. The cabinet received advice last week from its scientists on Sage about whether it is effective for people to wear face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus but it is refusing to share the information or make recommendations as a result of the advice. The Scottish government advised on Tuesday that people should wear face masks in shops and on public transport. Questions are being asked about why No 10 is refusing to come to a decision when every day could be crucial in terms of stopping the further spread of the virus. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff188a4a59ce8a2605e2ebd6c5a9b697d5c11a5c/0_71_3090_1855/master/3090.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=97a3ca24084846c0a7de506f574ae58c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CDominic+Cummings%2CPatrick+Vallance%2CConservatives%2CHealth%2CMatt+Hancock%2CDominic+Raab https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/nhs-worker-david-gomoh-stabbed-death-before-father-funeral-london,uk-news, NHS worker stabbed to death by gang 'wearing medical masks', David Gomoh attacked in east London days before funeral of father who died from Covid-19, David Gomoh  24  was set upon by a gang of four to five males moments after he left his home in east London  close to the NHS Nightingale field hospital at the Excel centre  on Sunday evening. Police say the attack was unprovoked and against a wholly innocent victim by a gang that went out armed and looking for a target. Gomoh’s family have been left suffering “unimaginable torment” and are due to bury his father on Wednesday after he died from a Covid-19 related illness. Police said Gomoh was stabbed multiple times and suffered at least four knife wounds. The attack from start to finish lasted 10 seconds  during which time the gang spotted Gomoh  got out of a car and stabbed him repeatedly  then got back in the car and sped off. Surgical-style masks and gloves were found close to the scene of the murder  and also close to where the car was dumped  the Guardian understands. But detectives are bearing in mind the greater use of masks and gloves due to the coronavirus outbreak. They are keeping an open mind on a possible motive  though one theory being examined is that the gang was looking for revenge on anyone in that postcode. Police said Gomoh’s mother and sister  who also work for the NHS  were “heartbroken”. Gomoh  a marketing graduate from South Bank University in London  worked in NHS supplies and procurement and lived with his mother and sister. Just before 10.25pm on Sunday evening he left home to go to a nearby shop. Police said he was on the phone speaking to a friend when the gang  driving a stolen silver Dodge Caliber  spotted him and rushed out of the vehicle with at least two knives. The attack happened in Freemasons Road  near the junction with Kerry Close  in Canning Town. The car was abandoned about half a mile away. It had been stolen in Dagenham 11 days earlier and its number plates had been cloned. DI Tony Kirk of the Metropolitan police’s specialist crime command  who is leading the investigation  said. “David’s family are going through unimaginable torment. Within days his mother has seen the death of her husband and son; his sister has lost her brother and father  both are now heartbroken. “David was a young man who had worked hard to put himself through university and  like his mother  worked hard for the community in the NHS. At this time we believe the only thing David did to be murdered was walk down a street. He was apparently approached by a group of men wearing masks and stabbed multiple times in a ferocious assault. “I have no doubt this was a planned attack that singled out David because he happened to be in that area. David and his mother  who have done so much to help the community  now need the public to come forward and tell us what they know.

28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/son-of-doctor-who-died-from-covid-19-still-hoping-for-ppe-apology,world, Son of doctor who died from Covid-19 still hoping for PPE apology, Government ignored letter written by Intisar Chowdhury’s father warning of shortages, In one of the most symbolic moments yet of the crisis  Intisar Chowdhury  18  picked up the baton from his father and  on the radio  asked the health secretary if he regretted not taking more seriously the concerns the doctor had raised in a letter to Downing Street two weeks before his death. His intervention led to figures from politics and beyond heaping pressure on the government to admit that it had made serious errors in relation to PPE for key workers who have died. They were commemorated on Tuesday in a one-minute silence. “I have faith there will be an apology because I do feel that it has come to a point where we need one. The government are not robots. They are humans and they will understand that ” Chowdhury told the Guardian after challenging Hancock on LBC radio. The health secretary would only go so far as to say he was really sorry about his father’s death. “I feel that was a blanket statement  that other senior government figures have forbid an apology and that was why Matt Hancock  Priti Patel and others have not given a real apology  Chowdhury said. “Whoever instructed that blanket statement – and I’m not sure who it was – was in the wrong for doing that because apologies are not an admission of guilt. Apologies are not going to make you liable for litigation and things like that. The purpose of them is to display honesty  integrity and build trust from the public. That is the most important aspect.” Dr Chowdhury  a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London  urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in an open letter last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19. In a Facebook post on 18 March  Abdul Mabud Chowdhury said: “People appreciate us and salute us for our rewarding job which are very inspirational but I would like to say we have to protect ourselves and our families/kids in this global disaster/crisis by using appropriate PPE and remedies.” The 53-year-old died on 8 April. On Tuesday  a grassroots lobbying and campaigning group advocating for the medical profession and wider NHS supported the call by Dr Chowdhury’s son for an official apology to the families of healthcare workers who have died. “I think an apology would be a first step in acknowledging what the government have provided NHS workers and social care workers in terms of PPE ” said Dr Rinesh Parmar  chair of the Doctors’ Association UK. “It has been inadequate and admitting that would be the the first part in recognising that the pandemic planning had not been robust enough.” The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats  Ed Davey  said it was “beyond belief” that there were still workers on the frontline without the protection they needed weeks after Dr Chowdhury’s death. “The government must apologise and they must ensure that all NHS and care workers receive the protection they need  it is fundamental to the credibility of the government.” The co-leader of the Green party  Jonathan Bartley  said: “It’s an obvious step to apologise and that should be one  but a real apology also means changing direction for everyone. An apology that is not backed up by action – whether that’s addressing the real needs of people in care homes and a whole range of neglected areas – would be pretty poor.” Meg Hillier  the east London Labour MP whose constituency includes Homerton hospital  called on the government “to stop being defensive and act” while her fellow Labour MP  Diane Abbott  added: “It is increasingly becoming clear that this a government with blood on its hands.” Further details also emerged of the kind of man Dr Chowdhury was  and of the heart-wrenching circumstances in which his family said goodbye as he lay unconscious in hospital. Because his 11-year-old sister had not been able to go into the room to say goodbye to their father  Chowdhury told how he had her write a message on his phone which he read on her behalf. Paying tribute to his father  who he said had looked forward to visiting and giving his time to the charity hospital he had established in is native Bangladesh  the teenager said: “He really was a man of the people and even when he was growing ill he was putting the needs of his colleagues and everyone using the NHS first by seeking to raise the PPE issue.” While the vast majority of reaction on social media had been positive  the teenager also said he had been reading comments on Twitter and YouTube that sought to claim he was “maintaining a political narrative”. “I want to apologise if I come across that way. With my grief I am not perhaps as aware of how I am coming across  but I feel a lot of people are assuming I am a leftwing Labour person. In reality I am not political at all. This is a human rights crisis and I am doing what I believe is the right thing in terms of human rights.” * Additional reporting by Mythili Rao , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d7e499eb4a1147fc5f8e52e6cde339468d73a81/0_72_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4da1294bfe0bb457bb90f292fa87bd93 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/497fe6d79057ae571d1787af4faa3d4605b8d407/0_1_729_911/master/729.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09ca433770b43087d04d555b36cf979f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBoris+Johnson%2CNHS%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/gove-graciously-concedes-we-havent-got-every-single-thing-right,politics, Gove graciously concedes we haven’t got every single thing right, A statement on coronavirus from the Cabinet Office minister was an exercise in blame-dodging, Gove was in the Commons to give what came billed as an “urgent statement on public services during the coronavirus”. Only he managed to deliver it without betraying the slightest sense of urgency  even when calling it the biggest crisis since the war. Apart from the 25 000 or so – he couldn’t give a precise number as the Office for National Statistics is always playing catch-up – who had died  the UK was basically in tip-top health. Yes  things were a bit challenging  but he’d basically just like to thank everyone from NHS staff to pharmacists  social workers and lorry drivers for doing their bit. “We haven’t got everything right ” he conceded as an afterthought – a bit of humility never goes amiss – but by and large he couldn’t think of a thing he would have done differently. Lockdown and social distancing had been implemented at exactly the right time  food supply chains were all fully operational  thousands of tests had been carried out and children were learning far more from the government’s online education resources than they ever had in school. He stopped short of saying greenhouse gas emissions and shoplifting were down  but then – for all his faults – he’s not as stupid as Priti Patel. But then no cabinet minister is. In her first appearance back on the Labour frontbench for the best part of five years  Rachel Reeves was both constructive and measured in her reply. She was less interested in Gove’s palliative care homilies and more concerned about what could be done to improve the situation. What was the plan – if indeed there was one – for ending lockdown? What was the government doing about domestic abuse and the protection of vulnerable children? Why were so many doctors being forced to re-use single-use personal protective equipment? And why had the government double-counted so many items in its list of PPE already distributed? The ending of lockdown is still apparently covered by the Official Secrets Act  meaning we may find out about in 30 years’ time  but Gove was at his most Uriah Heep in his other answers. Nobody cared more about vulnerable children than he did and it was desperately unfair for Reeves to have accused the government of double-counting PPE by listing each rubber glove individually. After all  strictly speaking  each finger and thumb could have been counted separately  in which case more than five billion pieces of PPE had so far been distributed. So if anything he had underestimated his government’s achievements. Pete Wishart  the SNP’s frontbench spokesperson  was unconvinced. It was clear from the previous night’s BBC Panorama documentary that the government had failed to stockpile the right levels of PPE so why couldn’t Gove just come out and admit it? Mikey’s ears pricked up at the suggestion of any admission of wrongdoing. He’s been in politics long enough not to implicate himself in anything that might have legal liability when a public inquiry is an inevitability. The government had always stockpiled exactly the amount of PPE the scientists had recommended  Gove said  citing a hitherto unknown advisory group. It didn’t exactly tally with anything we had heard about Exercise Cygnus  the 2016 pandemic plan  but maybe this new scientific panel is the only one on which Dominic Cummings isn’t thought to have sat in the past few years. It’s not hard to see that it’s the scientists that are being lined up for the show trial when the dust finally settles. The rest of the questions were batted away with Gove’s customarily urbane bedside manner. A veneer of civility masking condescension and contempt. Even towards his fellow Tory backbenchers  who are now beginning to have their doubts over the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Sitting in front of the country’s largest Union Jack  Desmond Swayne wondered why the scheme to attract more British fruit and veg pickers – last year’s every Brexiter’s wet dream – had barely managed to attract more than 100 takers. Gove wittered on about having once dug up a potato as a teenager. Far better than the real reason that no Brits are prepared to work 12-hour days for minimum wage while being put up in caravans on site. Where are the Romanians when you need them? The one question he answered directly was Tory Mark Harper’s on the discrepancy between the capacity for testing and the number of tests administered. Anything to throw Matt Hancock under a bus. Poor Tigger is everyone’s favourite fall guy now. Of course the important figure was the number of tests taken. He had no idea if the government would meet its 100 000 target a day by the end of the month Maybe it would  maybe it wouldn’t. But as this wasn’t a commitment he personally had made he wouldn’t be taking the rap for it. A few hours later  Hancock appeared in person at the 5pm Downing Street press conference where he basically said the same thing he has said for the last week. The media needed to stop concentrating on the number of deaths and start being a bit more positive about what had been done. The fact that the UK now topped the European mortality charts was just a statistical outlier. Something of which we could even be proud. We were a nation of winners. The government was doing a great job – with no thanks to the Govester – and he was determined not just to meet his testing target but to expand it. Hell  if necessary he could always ramp the figures up by testing the same people five times in as many minutes. And no  he wasn’t going to apologise for anything. Why should he? If he was going down  he would be making sure to take as many of his colleagues with him. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c33197d8dcb69491babe9d1156e01dd546733b0/0_34_2979_1789/master/2979.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e82d5e208a7d5a2adce0f1c6833e0dc6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Michael+Gove%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CScottish+National+party+%28SNP%29%2CMatt+Hancock%2CNHS https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/nandos-joins-burger-king-in-reopening-some-branches-for-deliveries,business, Nando's joins Burger King in reopening some branches for deliveries, Wagamama also set to resume deliveries in some areas  with McDonald’s carrying out trials, Burger King  which has already reopened six sites for delivery and takeaway  is opening eight more from Wednesday  including a drive-through. Restaurants and pubs were closed as part of the lockdown but are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery  and many have been providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers. After working with Deliveroo to serve more than 10 000 meals to charities and NHS workers from its kitchens  Nando’s has started offering home delivery from six outlets – four in London and two in Manchester – as part of a gradual reopening process. Burger King is reopening restaurants in Aberdeen  Dundee  Merton in south London  Reading  Southampton  and Hillington and Springfield Quay  both in Glasgow and aims to have at least one open in every city by 31 May. It is offering a limited menu and contactless delivery through Just Eat and Deliveroo. A drive-through Burger King in Hampshire is also reopening as a trial with a view to opening more such restaurants over the coming weeks. Katie Evans  the marketing director of Burger King UK  said: “We are so pleased to be able to open more restaurants across the UK this week  including our first restaurant for customer Drive Thru  which is a huge step forward.” KFC has reopened 11 restaurants with a limited menu for delivery only  in London  Hampshire  Birmingham  Glasgow  Sussex  Greater Manchester and Staffordshire. All the companies say their staff are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and practising physical distancing  and strict hygiene standards are being adhered to. Wagamama  the Restaurant Group-owned brand  has announced plans for a gradual return of its delivery operation. It says it has devised a schedule that will allow staff to slowly return to delivery-only work at their own discretion. The first sites to open will be Wagamama’s delivery kitchens in Peckham  Hackney  Bow and Leeds from Thursday. McDonald’s said it was carrying out operational tests behind closed doors this week in preparation for a limited reopening of some restaurants. Paul Pomroy  the chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland  said reopening would happen only “when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone’s wellbeing”. McDonald’s shut seating areas in mid-March and closed all takeaway and drive-through services a week later. It has more than 1 270 restaurants in the UK and employs more than 120 000 people. Pomroy said: “Restarting our business is not an easy task even when reopening in a limited capacity. We have set ourselves some key criteria for reopening  all of which take time: first and foremost  ensuring the wellbeing of our people and creating the right environment for them to return to work; secondly  ensuring we have enough supply of fresh produce; finally  working in step with government guidelines to ensure the safety of our customers.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8aa8f3f9509ebe5922ea86eb9f84144bd724ba/2_341_4713_2828/master/4713.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e907c8c92a760ba4bae1982fb7643efa https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Food+%26+drink+industry%2CRestaurant+Group%2CMcDonald%27s%2CBurger+King%2CDeliveroo%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/28/lost-henge-digging-archaeology-online-during-lockdown,education, Lost henge? Digging archaeology online during lockdown, With excavations shut because of coronavirus  online courses in Britain are experiencing a boom, He was following the line of the River Trent when he noticed an unusual feature close to the village of Swarkestone “and I thought  what’s that? It looks a bit odd  and a bit round.” Aerial photos of the ploughed field were unremarkable  but a Lidar image – a topographical scan using laser light – showed something that maybe  just maybe  appeared to be the ghostly image of a lost henge. A week or two later  having joined an online course run by the archaeology firm DigVentures – in part to help pass the time – Seddon uploaded his pictures to a discussion group  unsure if he had discovered a forgotten Neolithic monument  a former course of the river or a modern drainage ditch. The response from coursemates and professional archaeologists was as excited as he had hoped. While there is no way of knowing for sure without digging  says Lisa Westcott Wilkins  managing director of DigVentures  “we are very happy to say that this does indeed look like a ‘thing’”. Other known Neolithic sites nearby  the scale of the feature and the fact that historic field boundaries respect its course  all support the hypothesis  she says  that it could be a large henge – a significant find in this part of the country if so. “Of course  we are all just itching to get out there and investigate ” – just one more ambition put on hold by the current lockdown conditions. Seddon’s circular feature might be the most intriguing  but it is far from the only discovery shared by participants of the course. Developed several years ago to let students explore archaeology for the first time  or brush up on existing research  excavation and documentation skills  previous cohorts have seen about 80 participants at a time. But with almost all of this year’s excavations being shutdown because of the coronavirus crisis  the company decided to offer the course for free  and received an overwhelming response; 4 000 people from 69 countries are currently learning how to read maps  draw up plans and record finds from their own laptops. It is far from the only online course to have seen a rush in interest since lockdown began  nor the only one focused on archaeology. The Council for British Archaeology and Lincoln University last week launched Dig School  an online programme of archaeology-themed workshops aimed at school children and families  devised by Carenza Lewis  professor for public engagement at the University of Lincoln and a former presenter of Time Team. But while remote learning can be a challenge in any subject  acquiring practical skills such as how to handle a trowel or dig a test pit might seem a particular challenge for participants who  in many cases  are confined to flats without gardens or limited to a brief daily spin of their neighbourhoods. Learning about archaeology online “has renewed my hope [of finding] a dig to volunteer at  despite my age ” says Bonnie Stewart  a recently retired former quality manager from Asheville  North Carolina  whose lifelong passion for archaeology was sparked when she dug up a revolutionary-era stone musket ball in her back garden as a child. Living in an apartment  she has no opportunity to practise her trench-digging  so has opted for an online investigation into the area around Bath. “It was fun to find the Roman Baths and pretend that I was digging there.” Christine Green has had to temporarily close the craft shop she runs in Talgarth in the Brecon Beacons; her daughter had upcoming surgery cancelled as the crisis began  “so this is a very worrying time for both of us”. Inspired by the DigVentures course  she has dug a trench a metre-deep in her back garden  in which she has found nothing more precious than a fork and a marble. “But a couple of days ago when sitting in my trench with my brush and my palette knife  I suddenly realised that I actually felt happy and unstressed – both feelings somewhat alien to me currently.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cb180bf0635fa7375a381171b715a6e01f38904/0_29_1088_653/master/1088.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2481b85c45f75f95a6639ca0e8cad817 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a300e1e0343b7ef8cc93d946b95af476cba758/0_0_981_728/master/981.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b3236eb4915953ab8c0e3e88e80711d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Online+learning%2CArchaeology%2CUK+news%2CDigital+media%2CEducation%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/calls-for-more-space-walking-cycling-uk-during-lockdown-coronavirus,world, Calls for more space for walking and cycling in UK during lockdown, Experts urge councils to reallocate roads and prevent congestion when restrictions are lifted, Many cities around the world are taking action to reallocate road space away from motor vehicles to provide safe routes for sustainable travel. After the government’s chief medical adviser  Chris Whitty  suggested physical distancing may last for the rest of the year  Manchester announced plans to protect space for those on foot and cycles  but most UK councils have not yet taken any action. Experts fear a return to heavily congested roads when the lockdown is lifted could be damaging  as it is thought air pollution is likely to exacerbate Covid-19 problems. Furthermore  a rise in extreme speeding during the lockdown  has led experts to suggest motor traffic could prove disproportionately lethal during the pandemic and urge authorities to make changes to city streets. Ruth Cadbury  a Labour MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking  said action was needed to avoid a “nightmare” on the roads as restrictions are lifted. “I think people are going to rush back and to their cars where they would have gone to public transport  understandably fearing infection ” said Cadbury. “It won’t take long before our urban streets in particular  in our towns and city centres are more congested than ever  so we will end up with a nightmare situation.” The World Health Organization says cycling and walking are among the best ways to practise physical distancing. Cadbury said local authorities could allocate road space for walking and cycling via temporary or emergency traffic orders  bringing forward existing plans or targeting key commuter routes  including to hospitals. She said guidance from government would help. The government recently announced a minor relaxation of traffic regulation orders (TRO) allowing local authorities to close roads without the need to advertise measures in local media. However  Dr Rachel Aldred  at the University of Westminster  said councils had little experience of TROs and some fear legal challenges if they try to make such changes. She said: “The Department for Transport could help firstly by unambiguously stating that it expects and will support authorities to lock in traffic reduction and create conditions for safe walking and cycling  and simplifying the process through which they can install temporary changes.” The shadow green transport minister  Kerry McCarthy  said government could provide a “steer” to local councils. She said: “Do they want to go back to business as usual or do they want to use this as an opportunity to meet the goals we have got on air pollution  increasing active travel for people’s health while decreasing road transport and tackling congestion?” “If we don’t seize this moment  the moment will be lost if we return to normal ” she said. Greater Manchester’s walking and cycling commissioner  Chris Boardman  said local authorities can do more. “We have just weeks to act or face higher car use than ever as people avoid public transport ” he said. “Many cities around the world have seen the same threat and are putting in emergency measures to make sure people have a viable alternative to driving. UK cities have to make a call right now if they want to avoid gridlock and even higher pollution. “In anticipation of a prolonged recovery period  several Greater Manchester boroughs are now busy planning measures to ensure sufficient space is available for people to walk and ride.” DS Andy Cox  vision zero lead for the Metropolitan police  said he was “very concerned” about extreme speeding; while deaths and serious injuries overall are down  those relating to speed are not. With road traffic 50-60% lower in the capital  average speeds have increased in all speed zones. Some roads are seeing average speeds 50% higher than normal  Cox said. “There is a very significant risk at the moment  because of the high speeds we are seeing ” he said. “In the long term we would expect speeding to remain a critical focus because lower traffic volumes create an environment where more people can speed.” Cox said the UK legal system should recognise the devastation speeding can cause  including death and lifelong disability. Duncan Dollimore  Cycling UK head of campaigns  said pop-up walking and cycling space  as Milan is planning  could relieve pressure on public transport and help people maintain social distancing. More than 3 000 people have written to their councils calling for such measures since Thursday. “When lockdown is relaxed  people will need more space to keep safe so it’s essential councils introduce measures to make cycling and walking safer and social distancing easier right now in preparation for this time ” he said. Chris Heaton-Harris  the cycling minister  said cycling and walking were good ways for people “to get active and help their mental and physical health”. “To help encourage more cycling and walking  DfT issued guidance to make it easier for local authorities to make changes under traffic regulation orders ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7d09fd1af0dbe9869749023d28e120ead5f94f/0_229_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b288a787421ce9eaf6c7f7209c107bc3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Road+safety%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CCycling%2CUK+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news%2CHealth%2CEnvironment%2CAir+pollution%2CLife+and+style%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/cancer-patients-like-me-are-just-getting-forgotten-about,society, 'Cancer patients like me are just getting forgotten about', Covid-19 has led to hospitals suspending cancer treatment and deterred some from seeking care. Here  one patient tells his story, They diagnosed me with oesophageal cancer in January and were going to give me four treatments  then surgery to remove the cancer from my gullet  then four more sessions to clear any cancer they’d missed. Luckily  the chemotherapy worked and the cancer had gone from my lymph nodes  so the surgeon said I would have two more sessions  then he would schedule an operation to completely remove it  because three months after chemo it can come back. Then this pandemic came along and the operation in early May was cancelled  because I would have to be in the intensive care unit where beds are in short supply. It’s ridiculous they can’t separate patients and staff in the hospitals  to have a separate cancer wing. The whole world is understandably sympathising for coronavirus patients  but why must everything be for them? Cancer patients like me are just getting forgotten about. All people can think about is coronavirus and everybody wants to be seen to be doing their best to fight against it. I’m absolutely cross  I did lose my temper last week  but there’s nothing I can do about it. They said we’re hoping this coronavirus will die down in a few weeks and we can get you an operation. I asked: “What should I do in the meantime  go and die?” The doctor said: “Well  I can’t answer that.” It’s the not knowing. What am I going to say if they tell me they have to withdraw my treatment and there is no operation on the horizon. I have to have this operation  it’s the only way of properly getting rid of that cancer. There is only so much chemo you can have before it starts to kill white blood cells – that’s why your hair falls out. But I’m trying not to worry about it day by day. Whatever will be  will be. It’s just unfortunate I got it at the same time people got the coronavirus. I’m a married father of three children who I’m very proud of  and the government needs to do something. I need an operation. This would give me up to a 50% chance of living for at least another five years  but the cancer will kill me if I don’t get it removed. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900c3f2cba2d88190493bfea9e0d41c82a0f4f71/0_135_1600_959/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f489194695f5ca7a3d9f96f7a1339a45 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62eafc75ec9356a2c7fe22172d76b1cb7679589/0_338_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c71de444a3349ddb9fa0f84da2b2c31 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d21aa68048afa75c9c027677f805f15ab3831272/28_754_4051_2432/master/4051.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d74ae66375fe8bf93541152c8de7032a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f32b61b6193c03389790e5c1ccd392c25c961f9/0_439_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a1031a46d1150b36982cf042d2bc6a30 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d30e28d45d5bb7fd67b7f634fc35e32e5e5cd4/0_1476_5484_3290/master/5484.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d2f04709d8719f6fc6a916884af818d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Cancer%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight,world, Care home fatalities to be included in daily coronavirus death tolls, Move comes after sharp rise of more than 4 300 deaths over a fortnight in England and Wales, The health secretary  Matt Hancock  said care deaths would now be tracked in the same way as hospital fatalities “to keep the focus on what is happening in care homes” and allow policy to be changed swiftly if needed. Until now  data has been published weekly and a week out of date. But Hancock declined to apologise to bereaved families for failing to protect their loved ones  amid widely reported shortages of personal protective equipment and testing in care homes. Hancock said testing would be expanded to include people with coronavirus symptoms aged over 65 and members of their households  as well as workers who have had to leave home in order to do their jobs  and their households. “Building on successful pilots  we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England  and to patients and staff in the NHS. This will mean that anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test whether they have symptoms or not ” Hancock said. “The spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority.” Data gathered by the Care Quality Commission (CQC)  the care homes regulator  published for the first time on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics showed that from 10-24 April care homes reported 4 343 deaths from coronavirus. Half of them came in the last five days  indicating an accelerating death toll. It marks a sharp rise in the official death toll in care homes  which stood at 1 043 up to 10 April. There has been growing frustration among care home operators  staff and relatives that the government has underestimated the gravity of the impact of the virus in care. In the week to 17 April almost a quarter of recorded deaths from the virus happened in care homes  and local authority social care directors have said the death toll in care and community settings is likely to rise higher than that in NHS hospitals. The latter toll reached 21 678 on Tuesday. Labour said the latest care home figures showed “the appalling impact Covid-19 is having on people who use social care”. Liz Kendall  the shadow minister for care and older people  urged Hancock to deliver “whatever resources it takes” for care homes to tackle the pandemic  guaranteeing personal protective equipment (PPE) for care workers and priority testing close to their homes. She called on Hancock to use spare NHS capacity including the Nightingale hospitals to receive people discharged from hospital with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis rather than sending them into care homes  and also to accept coronavirus patients from care homes that are struggling to cope. Care home operators said the ONS data appeared to be finally starting to catch up with death rates they had been seeing for several weeks. Sam Monaghan  the chief executive of MHA  the largest charitable operator of care homes  at which 294 residents have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus  said the figures were starting to show “what we have known for some weeks now  that care homes are sadly the most affected area of society in terms of deaths from Covid-19”. The ONS cautioned that the figures  gathered from notifications from providers  may yet be an underestimate because of reporting delays. Figures gathered by the Guardian from the largest care home chains have shown rises in the number of fatalities from Covid-19 in residential and nursing homes of between 50% and 79% in the last one to two weeks. Vic Rayner  the chief executive of the National Care Forum  said the figures showed “the very urgent need for a daily tracking of all Covid-19 deaths as a key priority for the government” and called for a “ring of steel” around care homes. “They need the right PPE equipment  medical monitoring devices  rapid and comprehensive testing  proper funding and intensive research to safeguard the people they care for ” she said. Up to 17 April there were 22 300 deaths registered in England and Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on death certificates. The virus accounted for 39% of all deaths  over half of the death toll in London and more than 40% in the north-west and the north-east. Separately  figures for Scotland show that by 19 April  of the 1 616 deaths from the virus  a third happened in care homes. The number of deaths in care homes where Covid-19 has been included on the death certificate has risen sharply from two in the week ending 20 March  to 22  217  1 043 and 3 093 in the following four weeks to 17 April  according to the ONS. The CQC figures  which account for a further week but are broadly tracking the ONS figures  suggest the ONS data next week is likely to show well over 5 000 care home deaths in total. ONS data has to be certified by a doctor  registered and processed  and so is usually published approximately 11 days in arrears. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f5d615e775539aaefbc0c31862189262dfd20d/277_296_3121_1873/master/3121.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02d0c38d66cc9bce87d300542b8be416 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Social+care%2CCare+Quality+Commission+%28CQC%29%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/jair-bolsonaro-faces-inquiry-into-claims-of-meddling-with-police,world, Jair Bolsonaro faces inquiry into claims of meddling with police, Brazil’s top court approves investigation into explosive allegations against president, “The president of the republic … is also subject to the laws  just like any other of the country’s citizens ” the supreme court judge Celso de Mello noted in his decision on Monday night. “No one  absolutely no one  is entitled to infringe and show contempt for our country’s laws and constitution.” In a separate blow  a judge gave the federal government 48 hours to hand over the results of two Covid-19 tests Bolsonaro took last month but has refused to publish. More than 20 members of a delegation Bolsonaro took to meet Donald Trump in early March were infected  fuelling suspicions that Brazil’s president – whose handling of the coronavirus crisis has been widely criticised – had also been contaminated. Claims that Bolsonaro had improperly tried to meddle in Brazil’s equivalent to the FBI were made last Friday by Sergio Moro  the outgoing justice minister. As he resigned from Bolsonaro’s cabinet  Moro issued a potentially devastating parting shot: publicly accusing his former boss of wanting to replace the head of the federal police with someone more amenable to discussing police business and sharing intelligence reports with the president. “I said this would be political interference and he said it would indeed be ” claimed Moro  a former judge who many suspect harbours presidential ambitions of his own. Two prominent Brazilian newspapers  the Folha de São Paulo and Correio Braziliense  have claimed Bolsonaro’s desire to remove the federal police director was driven by the knowledge that investigators examining the criminal dissemination of fake news were closing in on his son Carlos Bolsonaro. Federal police investigators in Rio de Janeiro are also investigating another of the president’s sons  Flávio Bolsonaro  for suspected corruption and ties to Rio’s mafia. On Tuesday  Bolsonaro’s pick for the new federal police director was officially announced: the intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem  who is a friend of Carlos Bolsonaro. The appointment is expected to face legal challenges. The far-right president and his sons deny the accusations against them. On Tuesday  Estado de São Paulo claimed Moro would hand audio recordings to investigators as part of the inquiry into the president’s behaviour. The possible crimes for which Bolsonaro will be investigated reportedly include fraudulent misrepresentation  obstruction of justice and passive corruption. Moro will be investigated for so-called “crimes against honour and reputation”  which include calumny and defamation. Bolsonaro’s opponents – who decry his assaults on the environment  the arts and Brazil’s democracy – hope the investigation could eventually provide grounds for his impeachment. A poll on Monday suggested nearly half of Brazilians wanted Bolsonaro to resign – up from 37% last month  while 38% thought it was impossible to trust anything he said. However  the poll also showed Bolsonaro continuing to enjoy the support of 33% of voters – a reality that suggests impeachment is unlikely in the short term. When the former leftist president  Dilma Rousseff  was impeached in 2016 her support had collapsed to only around 13%. “He has already committed numerous crimes of responsibility – but for impeachment you need votes ” admitted Marcelo Freixo  a leftwing congressman from the Socialism and Liberty party. “The whole of the left in parliament has 134 representatives. Bolsonaro has 210 on his side ” Freixo added. “I favour impeachment but being in favour of impeachment isn’t enough. You need the votes.” Eliane Cantanhêde  a columnist for the Estado de São Paulo  predicted Bolsonaro would pay a heavy price for creating a political crisis at the very moment Brazil needed to focus on the coronavirus pandemic  which has now killed 4 603 Brazilians. “It’s insane ... It’s almost as if he’s asking to be impeached ” she said. But Cantanhêde said she still was not convinced there was currently enough political or public support for such a move. “Can you imagine an impeachment at this juncture? It would be very  very traumatic – especially with the economy crumbling and everything upside down.” Kim Kataguiri  a rightwing congressman who has been pushing for the release of Bolsonaro’s coronavirus test results  said the Brazilian people had a right to the truth. “This is a matter of public interest and must not be hidden … We need clarity ” said Kataguiri  who supported Bolsonaro before his 2018 election but has since turned on the president. Bolsonaro  who has faced global condemnation for repeatedly undermining the social distancing guidelines promoted by his own health ministry  made no immediate comment about the supreme court investigation. Instead the pro-gun populist ventured out of his presidential palace in the capital  Brasília  on Tuesday to visit a shooting range. In a video later posted on his official Facebook page  a grinning Bolsonaro appeared examining a bullet-riddled target. “Pretty good  eh?” he says. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2961cc36cc46916fba8b7f19e6908515af2b38b/116_837_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f3087e0dd493c008cdab8d9b9ae2b94 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c6258af6e7c6104f283bdadb25d4f457d8add0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95d27437ad3c84853a2882cb29428774 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a93674f518983763be1f4521618205cbb033fd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f430a280859eab0bfe9a1ace44d9d8b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46829f1f4a4a2267644b3c4578fc2d428ef7ca76/0_65_1962_1177/master/1962.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5675390e41cda23475188247947c1329 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728a8daf5c1ce78620f5269e4f8f7f57b4cc7ef4/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=79faaf069ad1886a3ab823026a3e5cfa https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Jair+Bolsonaro%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/lithuanian-capital-to-be-turned-into-vast-open-air-cafe-vilnius,world, Lithuanian capital to be turned into vast open-air cafe, Vilnius gives public space to bars and cafes to allow physical distancing during lockdown, The Baltic state  which has recorded 1 344 cases of the coronavirus and 44 deaths  allowed cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating  hairdressers and almost all shops to begin reopening this week as part of a staged exit from lockdown. But the health ministry has imposed strict physical distancing rules and safety measures. Shops must limit the number of customers at one time  masks will remain mandatory in all public spaces  and cafe and restaurant tables have to be placed at least two metres apart. That posed a problem for many restaurateurs in Vilnius old town  Senamiestis  a Unesco-listed world heritage site whose narrow streets make it almost impossible to place more than a couple of tables outside – prompting the mayor’s offer. “Plazas  squares  streets – nearby cafes will be allowed to set up outdoor tables free of charge this season and thus conduct their activities during quarantine ” said Remigijus Šimašius. Public safety remained the city’s top priority  the mayor said  but the measure should help cafes to “open up  work  retain jobs and keep Vilnius alive”. Eighteen of the city’s public spaces  including its central Cathedral Square  have been opened up for outdoor cafes and restaurants  city hall said  and more are expected to be added as the summer progresses. The move has been welcomed by owners  with more than 160 applying to take up the offer. “It came just in time ” said Evalda Šiškauskien? of the Lithuanian Association of Hotels and Restaurants  adding that the measure would help members “accommodate more visitors and bring life back to the city streets  but without violating security requirements”. Vilnius authorities have also given the city’s public health workers €400 000-worth (£350 000) of restaurant vouchers intended both as gesture of thanks for their work and a much-needed stimulus to the city’s cafes. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c06e5afb113514b0a1ed5990a9db51bd1734d9b/0_37_5480_3290/master/5480.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ae5440f0768015d5339dd986bfbbdb2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Lithuania%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/the-future-looks-bleak-europes-restaurants-after-lockdown,world, Can Europe’s restaurants survive the coronavirus lockdown?, Chefs and owners fear bankruptcy as continent’s gastronomic culture remains in limboby Philip Oltermannin Berlin  Sam Jones in Madrid  Kim Willsher in Paris and Angela Giuffrida in Orvieto, In a crammed 40 sq metre (430 sq ft) space tucked away in a side street of scruffy but fashionable Neukölln  the owner  Christiane Föll  has for the last 10 years served up sumptuous Franco-German cuisine  darting between 10 rickety wooden tables night after night to recommend the organic entrecôte  pour another glass of Spätburgunder or share the latest locally sourced gossip. Since Berlin went into lockdown on 14 March  however  the front door at Föllerei (a play on the German word for gluttony) has remained shut – and it is unclear if it will ever open again. As European countries nervously begin to extricate themselves from restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19  shops are beckoning in customers  metro trains are returning to regular service  and even hairdressers are sharpening their scissors. Only three countries – Austria  the Czech Republic and Italy – have put a tentative date on when restaurants can resume service. As such  almost an entire continent’s gastronomic culture remains in limbo. “The future looks bleak ” said Föll  who has already had to lay off two of her four employees. If she were to remove one of the tables  the owner and maître d’ calculates  she could just about guarantee a safe distance between diners but would then struggle to cover her running costs. “It just feels like personal bad luck ” said the 56-year-old  whose little restaurant managed to break even at the end of last year for the first time in a decade. Last Wednesday  the German government announced it would help the food industry by cutting VAT from 19% to 7% from 1 July  though Berlin’s chamber of industry and trade fears many restaurants will already have been forced to go into administration by then. “People don’t just fear for their livelihood – they are increasingly panicked ” said Thomas Lengfelder  the director of Berlin’s association for restaurants and hotels. “The corona restrictions will lead to a wave of bankruptcies like we have never seen before.” On Tuesday  German economy minister Peter Altmaier conceded his government might be forced to set up a “rescue fund for gastronomy” unless full openings could happen soon. In France  the cradle of modern European gastronomy  strict lockdown measures will end on 11 May but the government has yet to say when the country’s 240 000 restaurants and cafés can reopen. French media suggested last week that if the outbreak was under control at the end of the lockdown  they may be allowed to open in mid-June. The government has promised to publish an “operational guide” outlining how restaurants and other outlets can maintain barrier and social distancing rules. Roland Héguy  the president of the hotel industry union UMIH  said 2020 would be a “lost year” for members. “It’s regrettable that we are the only sector that has no outlook for the future opening of our establishments  even when we are already working on practical guides on how to do our job while keeping our staff and customers safe ” Héguy said. On 20 April  18 of France’s most celebrated chefs published an open letter in Le Figaro warning that the country’s restaurants were “in danger of dying” and calling on the president  Emmanuel Macron  to allow them to open. At the time of year when tables and chairs would normally be returning to pavements and terraces outside cafes and bars in Spain  the authorities are exploring how a phased return might work. This month  the mayor of Madrid  José Luis Martínez-Almeida  said the city council was looking into reducing capacity in restaurants  enlarging outside seating areas and installing screens to separate diners. “These measures are designed to allow businesses to reopen as soon as possible – while observing social distancing rules – so that they can make up their losses and the economy can be reactivated ” he told the Spanish TV programme Espejo Público. In Austria  restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 15 May if they adhere to a set of rules  including a maximum number of four adults per table and a minimum 1m distance between groups. Waiters will be required to wear masks while taking orders and serving dishes. Diners are advised to book tables in advance  to avoid queues and make it easier to trace possible infection chains further down the line. Many restaurants across the continent are already improvising to adapt to the new reality. Towards the end of a normal April  the terrace at Capitano Del Popolo  a restaurant in the hilltop town of Orvieto  in Italy’s central Umbria region  would be buzzing with customers enjoying early spring. Instead  chef Valentina Santanicchio is busy cooking made-to-order meals  packing them in boxes and delivering them to people’s homes on her bicycle. “On the day we found out about the lockdown  I cried and panicked ” she said. “At that point  we understood that the situation was really serious but we also worried about the future. For the first week I was in shock as I tried to understand what it all meant. Then I tried to have a different outlook – do I close and abandon everything  or do I try to move forward in some way?” Neighbourhood bars and restaurants are the lifeblood of many Italians towns  but their futures are in peril after more than seven weeks in lockdown. Other restaurant owners in Orvieto  which is heavily dependent on tourism  have also adopted home delivery services  as much to keep themselves occupied as to mitigate the risk to business. For Santanicchio  home delivery has been a novelty  albeit a successful one. Still  the bigger challenges for Italy’s catering businesses are yet to come. The country is in lockdown until 3 May  after which restrictions will gradually be eased  with bars and restaurants scheduled to open on 1 June. But FIPE  the Italian association for bars and restaurants  warned last week that as many as 50 000 across the country may be forced to close for good. The businesses are entitled to claim €600 (£520) for each month closed and can apply for subsidised bank loans  repayable after two years. But payment of taxes owed during the lockdown has merely been postponed  and business owners still have to pay rent and bills. Staff have been furloughed but many are yet to receive their unemployment benefit. “Even though I am lucky to have many customers who live locally  the only certainty I have right now is that I will lose 60% of customers overall ” Santanicchio said. “People may be afraid to go to a restaurant or won’t have the money to spend. Coronavirus is very much the tip of the iceberg  because underneath there will be a frightening economic crisis.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b53c54da1163575ffc8afe35fae020c50507e06/1117_548_4949_3496/master/4949.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2987cdbbf8e5c8f04ecbf588444b2c71 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da36214e45d66f77f3e0764bab26272bd8d2be1e/0_2_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f86b6f45262f44e105b24c5ecf0a16b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b259a88c8d40db0d2b1f8c43d67526ce9865ef4a/0_0_3072_2048/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=284c8697dce33b0ca6e1de63851806a0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4697f1dacd5e09b518ec2f34a6a4ccffdb49222f/0_0_5666_3765/master/5666.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a437188f4a6ac0c87a3bc7716aeb934b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4def75375ca4e85496e13dc947e305eefb352375/0_212_5000_3146/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3862b43bff60b51ba2287902df977a1 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0672b3fa70899c3c88416a3dbe2af2901b0669a9/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1e9490bb9e3d0b5cb67a31a6b7ad0550 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf646ec28d296be0ac57fd65f3412111b809d3a6/201_340_3094_1857/master/3094.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70a3564e55dc3ddf3fe18416f9ba73a9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b48a2040083212b4e20e2bd5d32f3fc0ed74f8e/0_0_3072_1991/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e0f9d16fe9a361c6ddfcc497afa8aa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CRestaurants%2CRestaurants%2CGermany%2CFrance%2CItaly%2CSpain https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/un-chief-dont-use-taxpayer-money-to-save-polluting-industries,environment, UN chief: don't use taxpayer money to save polluting industries, António Guterres calls for coronavirus aid to be directed at firms with green credentials, “Where taxpayers’ money is used to rescue businesses  it must be creating green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth ” said António Guterres  speaking at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue  a virtual meeting of more than 30 governments on the climate crisis  which concluded on Tuesday. “It must not be bailing out outdated  polluting  carbon-intensive industries.” His call was echoed by Angela Merkel  the German chancellor  who led the meeting  which was also attended by the UK and China. “The coronavirus shows us that international cooperation is crucial and that the wellbeing of one nation always depends on the wellbeing of others ” she said. “There will be a difficult debate about the allocation of funds. But it is important that recovery programmes always keep an eye on the climate. We must not sideline climate  but invest in climate technologies.” She confirmed German support within the EU for a target of cutting emissions by 50-55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. The target is currently the subject of debate within the bloc. Many countries are planning big investments in fossil fuel industries as part of their economic rescue packages. For instance  in the US the bailout of the airline industry is set to go ahead without conditions attached on their emissions  while the White House has moved to weaken a raft of environmental regulations. In China  subsidies for fossil fuel vehicles and the easing of permits for coalmining are also likely to raise emissions. While greenhouse gas emissions are set to fall this year  perhaps by as much as a tenth  any beneficial impact on the climate is likely to be short-lived and could quickly be outweighed by increased emissions if the economic recovery resumes on a high-carbon path. Low oil prices mean producers are running out of economic ways to store their excess. Campaigners and experts have been calling for economic rescue packages to be directed towards environmentally sustainable ends and for sectoral stimulus cash to come with green strings attached. Dominic Raab  the UK’s foreign secretary  said: “It will be the duty of every responsible government to see that our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that will stand the test of time. That means investing in industries and infrastructure that can turn the tide on climate change and doing all we can to boost resilience by shaping economies that can withstand everything nature throws at us.” However  he failed to set out any measures on how the UK government would ensure that its rescue packages – for instance  those called for by the airline and car manufacturing industries – were balanced with conditions that would ensure benefiting companies had to take action to reduce carbon use in the future. Richard Black  the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit  said it was time for such measures. “Backing for a clean recovery is now widespread  led by governments and major businesses ” he said. “For actions to match rhetoric  concrete policies are going to be needed very soon – for example  the UK government delivering new policies that get the nation on track to its legally binding net-zero target  and making sure the world doesn’t bounce back into high-polluting ways as soon as the lockdown eases.” Guterres called for tougher action on cutting emissions  as well as more investment. “Public funds should invest in the future by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end  and carbon must have a price so polluters will pay for their pollution ” he said. Guterres also called for developing countries to receive $100bn (£82bn) a year  a longstanding goal under the global climate negotiations  to help them curb emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown  and he hinted at moves to reduce the debt on many developing countries  which has been mooted as a way to help them during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of developing countries to serve as a barrier to their ambition [on the climate] ” he said. Rich countries must all commit to zero-carbon emissions by 2050  added Guterres  with a particular nod to the US and China. “The Paris agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the US and China. Without the contribution of the big emitters  all our efforts will be doomed.” Helen Clarkson  the chief executive of The Climate Group  a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate  said companies were still committed to climate action. “With the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy  we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth ” she said. The UK will host global climate talks next year  after the UN’s Cop26 summit had to be postponed from its original date of this November. No date has yet to be set for the rearranged meeting  but work is continuing on diplomatic engagement aimed at encouraging countries to come forward with more ambitious climate plans  according to the UK government. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0ecde26645882dc8457c86ad576e2da6682777b/0_105_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5ca43f1d131d11d245c3b247f051902 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c907f37e7211025526e29da09af7f16f497089/0_81_5204_3124/master/5204.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28554f262f29f391a96e26bcdb65eae2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fd9c7d132a208ae4f7469dec8b8eccec533b44/0_374_5611_3367/master/5611.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6ed798b3e67a53b5ca44b3fd645e1b8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9084492f6d55c240bc799291cd43350ae38ec3a5/0_0_638_383/master/638.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72ddddef67e94bc3c268f558d5dead6f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Greenhouse+gas+emissions%2CFossil+fuels%2CClimate+change%2CUnited+Nations%2CEconomic+policy%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEconomics%2CEnvironment%2CWorld+news%2CEnergy%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/ramadan-tv-dramas-signal-shift-in-arab-israeli-relations,world, Ramadan TV dramas signal shift in Arab-Israeli relations, Two popular Middle Eastern series stir surprise with pro-Israel messages backed by Saudi Arabia, Two series broadcast across the region in the first three days of the Muslim holy month have stirred both surprise and contention – one by daring to explore the Jewish history of the Gulf  the other by suggesting that Israel may not be an enemy and that Palestinians have been ungrateful for Saudi Arabia’s support. The unusually pointed messages have both aired on the Saudi-controlled satellite channel MBC  offering little doubt that they had been sanctioned by the country’s leaders. The broadcasts have left some viewers reeling at the spectre of Ramadan becoming a forum to showcase political shifts and others claiming they belatedly addressed issues that had been airbrushed from Saudi culture. When satellite TV took hold across the Middle East from the early 1990s  the appeal of Ramadan TV drama shows as a forum to project soft power soon became apparent. Leaders recognised their potential to shape debate as the popularity of the soaps surged. The Egyptian president  Abdel Fatah al-Sisi  has included the dramas in his clampdown on free expression  putting pressure on filmmakers to emphasise approved themes such as the glory of the military and perfidy of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. A 2016 series lauded as the first “political drama” produced in the United Arab Emirates also focused on the “evils” of the Brotherhood. Judaism has received warmer treatment in recent years  even as Israel was still portrayed with hostility. A 2015 drama sympathetically depicted Egypt’s Jewish community while emphasising them as staunchly opposed to Israel’s creation. If the first days of this year’s Ramadan are any guide  2020 breaks new ground. The characters in both series  Exit 7 and Umm Haroun  are depicted debating not whether Israel should exist but whether doing business with Israelis should override concerns. The stances taken in both shows are aligned with Saudi government positions  which have drawn the two countries closer than at any time since the state of Israel was formed in 1948. Mutual security concerns about Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood have been instrumental in the shift  which have also led to ties with Saudis Gulf allies thawing to the point that Israelis can now enter the UAE  and previously undisclosed trade ties are public. The Israeli prime minister’s approach has been to promote relations with the Gulf and Saudi Arabia  while at the same time marginalising the Palestinians. “What is happening with Arab states has never happened in our history  even when we signed peace agreements ” Benjamin Netanyahu has said on more than one occasion. “Cooperation in different ways and at different levels isn’t necessarily visible above the surface  but what is below the surface is far greater than at any other period.” Israeli media reported in January that Riyadh was formally allowing Israeli citizens to visit the kingdom for the first time  provided they were Muslims performing pilgrimages to Mecca or invited by the government and looking to do business. That month  the US president  Donald Trump  unveiled his peace plan for the region in Washington in front of diplomats from Oman  Bahrain and the UAE. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner  a friend of the heir to the Saudi throne  Prince Mohammed bin Salman  was instrumental in drafting the plan  which offered a markedly reduced deal to the Palestinians than any earlier package and has since gone nowhere. Riyadh was officially non-committal  though some former Saudi officials sharply criticised the plan’s outline. • This article was amended on 29 April 2020. A reference to “Riyadh and Tel Aviv” was amended to “the two countries”  meaning Saudi Arabia and Israel. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/343e4dd75b57002cced1a7006bd025124fe9e40f/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=253871c0d2162170e793f65495b1b799 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ramadan%2CSaudi+Arabia%2CIsrael%2CPalestinian+territories%2CMiddle+East+peace+talks%2CIslam%2CReligion%2CWorld+news%2CMiddle+East+and+North+Africa https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/norwegian-tycoon-tom-hagen-arrested-over-wifes-disappearance-in-2018,world, Norwegian tycoon charged over wife's disappearance in 2018, Businessman held on suspicion of murder in case first treated by police as kidnapping, Tom Hagen  a hitherto low-profile property and energy tycoon aged 70  was arrested on his way to work  Norwegian media reported. In a statement released on Tuesday  Norwegian police said they had “reasonable reason to suspect Tom Hagen of the murder or complicity in the murder of Anne-Elisabeth Hagen”. Investigators originally thought Anne-Elisabeth Hagen  who was 68 when she was reported missing on 31 October 2018  had been abducted by a criminal gang seeking ransom. But on Tuesday  police said they believed that no abduction had taken place and there had never been a counter party seeking a ransom. “In other words  the police believe that the case is characterised by a clear  planned deception ” the statement said. “It is important to emphasise that even though we have a charge  the case is still under investigation and there are several unanswered questions that the police will continue to work on.” Police say it was important to clarify Tom Hagen’s role  find Anne-Elisabeth Hagen and work out if other people were involved. Hagen’s lawyer Svein Holden told Norwegian media that his client had nothing to do with Anne-Elisabeth’s disappearance. The tycoon was expected to be questioned by police later on Tuesday. He will be held in pre-trial custody for four weeks and prosecutors are arguing he should not be bailed. Police have declined to elaborate on a motive because of the ongoing investigation  and have not ruled out further arrests. Anne-Elisabeth Hagen had been married to Tom Hagen for 49 years when she disappeared from the couple’s home in Lørenskog  20km (12 miles) east of Oslo  in October 2018. Police found signs of a struggle that suggested she had been taken away by force. The case did not come to public attention until January 2019  when police announced her suspected kidnapping. At the time police reported they had received a ransom demand and serious threats against her. The ransom was a poorly written demand for €9m (£7.8m)  to be paid in cryptocurrency  Norwegian media reported at the time. By June 2019  when no trace of Hagen had been found  while the presumed kidnappers were unable to prove they were holding her  the main police hypothesis switched to murder disguised as kidnapping. According to Norway’s public broadcaster NRK  police began investigating Tom Hagen in secret last summer. During the 18-month investigation  police have enlisted the help of the FBI in the US and Swedish police dogs  according to Norwegian media  as well examined 6 000 hours of video footage. Tom Hagen is Norway’s 164th richest man  according to the magazine Kapital  with an estimated fortune of 1.9bn kroner (£147m). He made his money by founding electricity supplier Elkraft in 1991 and currently holds a 70% stake in the company  which operates throughout Scandinavia.  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b70bf3275be46506abfda63bd7f57b08787a25/0_186_2440_1463/master/2440.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7b3061f963f6e5227c136fcdea76d23 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d73b81e6d3b1e3cfeb29db2674fec3a4915ad0cc/0_54_716_895/master/716.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d3b91ec69b90e7e5f149164a18d2a70 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bea6bd202161426366b703bec10c71e5ac953f0/0_443_9037_5423/master/9037.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16c593c6a4b630f15c0780a6d2ed3f0e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321b26dea7ef364d92ed90cce02f70d494cfa3ae/0_143_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e29426dc97235707d160f18422f8d74 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81fd91366810efa37ef76f9436cbf3c3df9940d/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=caf4d42ae75e78aef949c6b239a3812b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3366cdbbd131e932ff7193b5d619cbe98a542763/0_377_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c67e02f4828d84bccb48802dfbe1e72c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890af5346af04027fc577feb19e4f697bdb09cc9/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dff915737120c82b5415fad4cba3d60d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Norway%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/giant-new-russian-cathedral-glorifies-putin-stalin-mosaics,world, Giant new Russian cathedral glorifies Putin and Stalin in mosaics, Crimea annexation also exalted in Moscow church due to open on anniversary of 1945 victory, The mammoth structure will be one of the world’s tallest Orthodox cathedrals when it opens in the military’s Patriot Park outside Moscow on 9 May . Largely  the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral is a monument to the Soviet victory in the second world war. The diameter of the drum under the main cupola will measure 19.45 metres to signify the year the war ended  and a “road of memory” will have 1 418 steps  corresponding to the number of days the Soviet Union fought in the war. Its main steps are reportedly forged from metal salvaged from Nazi military hardware. But special attention has been paid to several eye-catching mosaics that glorify Putin and other Russian officials during the annexation of Crimea in 2014  an operation led by unmarked Russian army units referred to as “little green men”. One of the mosaics  first revealed by the MBKh News website  depicts Putin  Sergei Shoigu  the defence minister  Alexander Bortnikov  the head of the Federal Security Service  and other top brass walking among a sea of Russians bearing tricolour flags. Also in the crowd appear to be Valery Gerasimov  a prominent Russian general  and Sergey Aksyonov  the current head of Crimea installed by Putin. A missing panel photographed separately shows several women in front of a sign that reads “Crimea is ours”. Andrey Kuraev  an archdeacon  wrote: “It’s like a guilty plea to The Hague. If an icon with the conquest of Crimea is placed in an army cathedral  that means the army played a decisive role in this operation.” Church officials confirmed the leaked pictures  saying it was custom to include real figures in church mosaics. “There has always been this tradition  when historical scenes are depicted from one period or another. It’s understood that one of these meaningful events was the accession of Crimea. The leading members of the government  who will be depicted here  took part in that accession ” Bishop Stefan  the head of the cathedral  told the business newspaper RBC. Another mosaic depicts the 1945 parade following the victory over Nazi Germany  with a crowd of soldiers standing in front of the Kremlin and a banner bearing a portrait of Stalin. It is one of his first appearances on a state building since the 1960s. “They are holding a poster with Stalin  but he isn’t among the marshals of the victory  despite being the commander in chief ” the artist who made the mosaics told the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. Putin has reacted carefully to public revelations about the mosaics. A spokesman said on Sunday: “When he was told about this  he smiled and said: ‘Someday our thankful descendants will appreciate our merits  but it’s too early to do so now.’” On Monday evening the church said it would engage its arts committee to review the mosaic. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9acd40663c33ffbe7abb9d562a9f4e9ab11cd5/126_0_3348_2010/master/3348.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce4d561497aa21dc506067f3b74fd9d5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb46c04637c73c8fe8463330cfa822d5a1681043/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0abe7b10194ca3d764df9b17dbbcd3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a14c5a1d39d5ed64a40300e1225cb472b0a849/0_552_3468_2080/master/3468.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=421c237c931af52a506b12b8a7512a7f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3188c09feb5f15567d3bc536941cfc3ecb124cad/0_134_2216_1331/master/2216..jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bea9351bc32aad01d4f23733a3879e6f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b54e96b32b2aafa6f001cfd91778d92c95248e/0_279_4191_2515/master/4191.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7956ddc0c2cf3066130193981994e51d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f24eaf03b56b1968708b9fa2d176242087e8dc4/0_116_3725_2235/master/3725.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6b94c1aac755c5059e37b70a60cdbac https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Russia%2CVladimir+Putin%2CJoseph+Stalin%2CCrimea%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CSecond+world+war https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/completion-new-genoa-bridge-symbol-of-hope-italy-morandi,world, Completion of new Genoa bridge seen as symbol of hope in Italy, Opening hailed but offers little comfort to families of Morandi bridge collapse victims, “We live in different places and so haven’t always managed to get there every month ” said Egle Possetti  whose sister  brother-in-law  niece and nephew were among the 43 killed on 14 August 2018. “But there’s a woman in Genoa who brings flowers on behalf of all of us.” Only March was skipped  owing to Italy going into the coronavirus lockdown  while on 14 April the woman who brings the flowers did so wearing a face mask. The tribute has brought a regular reminder of the tragedy to the team of more than 500 building a new bridge in the coastal city  who on Tuesday inaugurated the structure in a ceremony led by the Italian prime minister  Giuseppe Conte  after the last 44-metre span was hoisted into place. It is expected to open to traffic in July. Work on the site continued during the peak of the pandemic  albeit under strict safety regulations  on what is considered a strategic commercial project linking Italy to France. Construction had begun in earnest in August 2019 shortly after what remained of the bridge was demolished. Its completion provides a rare moment of hope in a country where nearly 27 000 have died from coronavirus. “Genoa is a model for Italy ” Conte said on Tuesday. “And it teaches us that the greatest act of love is when we commit to restarting together. Genoa radiates a light that gives hope to the whole of Italy.” Drawings for the new bridge were donated by Renzo Piano  the Genoa-born architect who designed the Shard in London. Piano’s design for the structure  stretching 1km across the Polcevera valley  includes solar panels mounted along each side to generate electricity needed to power its lights and sensors. Experts and residents long had concerns over the safety of its predecessor for decades before its collapse and the new bridge’s safety and durability has been prioritised  with robots deployed to inspect its solidity and conduct regular maintenance. “Since construction began  we have been working day and night. The only day the site closed was on Christmas Day ” said Stefano Mosconi  the site construction manager  when the Guardian visited in late February. “It has been emotional for everyone to be working on a project that is so important  also because we share a sense of responsibility linked to building something that will replace something that is not there any more  and which had very tragic consequences.” Pietro Salini  the chief executive of Salini Impregilo  building the new bridge in a joint venture with Fincantieri Infrastructure  compared the construction team’s dedication to that of a national football squad. “Everyone is unified ” he said. “For the victims but also out of respect for Genoa. People keep asking  ‘how is it possible that in only a few months you did most of the bridge?’ They say it’s a miracle – it’s not a miracle  it’s the work of human beings  men and women  using their hands.” He said Italy should seize the opportunity to revive stalled infrastructure projects and ensure proper maintenance of existing roads and bridges. “Italians have the luxury of living in a country where roads and buildings with stones and marble are still in use after centuries  giving the false impression that infrastructure lasts forever ” he added. “Most of Europe still relies to some extent on infrastructure built in the 19th century. There is a big need for renewal  let alone maintenance. After the collapse of the Morandi bridge  Italians woke up to the realisation that something has to be done to avoid another disaster of this kind.” The new structure restores a crucial route for commercial trade between Italy and France but the Morandi bridge  built in the 1960s  was also essential for serving Genoa’s port as well as for residents crossing from one side of the city to another and holidaymakers making their way to the mountains or Mediterranean beaches. Marco Bucci  the mayor of Genoa and commissioner for the project  said the bridge’s absence costs the city an estimated €6m (£5.2m) a day. Genoa’s administration quickly cut through Italy’s notorious red tape to get work started. “The tragedy was a tragedy but straightaway we saw it as an opportunity to roll up our sleeves  work hard and make sure the city gets new momentum ” said Bucci. “This is why for us  the bridge is not only a bridge but a way to demonstrate to Italy and the world that good things can be done here.” Bucci said he is in regular contact with the families of the victims and a memorial site is planned. “Every time we do something around the project we ask their opinion as we need to respect the opinion of the relatives of the people who died.” However  the new bridge is providing little comfort to the families of the dead awaiting the outcome of inquiries by prosecutors. Several executives of Atlantia  whose road tolls unit  Autostrade  was responsible for operating and maintaining the Morandi bridge  are still being investigated for manslaughter. Atlantia has denied any wrongdoing and said it always acted in compliance with its obligations. “In some ways seeing a new bridge being built so quickly is worse for us ” said Possetti  who is president of the remembering the victims of the Morandi bridge committee. “As the old bridge should have been demolished long before it collapsed and killed so many people. It was no longer capable of standing up.” , https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/768d8d7999510d6d05aa2d865640803c/this-is-europe.svg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7b3b306969d9e89658971fd60189b69585fcf9/0_0_3006_1804/master/3006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c8b3236afe5f41861f1399ed25cbd45 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2da68f88a36d7f7ae5ca1ef2dfcda401d531965/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0949bcdaacaa0c6201cba2f96f971419 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f58c9a421aceaf82f35dd50f579e34a2593ee0/0_94_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=999c75bdb77edf46aabb47aea82ffbb5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e885fd7960d7d91eb208a93c384e27f1810e64/39_0_5090_3054/master/5090.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56e07ea1fffe884bdc599fe300588f1c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52bd16856bd70e19887505a741f5df9766acc1f/0_172_5553_3332/master/5553.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dc154696680d76ff2865725ec5cf3c1b https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/768d8d7999510d6d05aa2d865640803c/this-is-europe.svg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a038926a8a878a61cd56165f711e8f216f54332/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3549541ecc7d0cb7b0ab2bfc4f613784 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3105065ebc29319157edede132128477f6ac94/324_149_5117_3070/master/5117.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15c0b6c55b1dbd04d1a4d44f9ca035ed https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e17221365110af6ffef388617c839c0c56d8ecbf/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad81f036985e424b74ad17e088c5eee9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Genoa+bridge+collapse%2CItaly%2CWorld+news%2CEurope https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans,us-news, Trump's judges: a revolution to create a new conservative America, The president’s judicial appointments have been a quieter project than most of his flamboyant presidency  but will have longer-lasting impacts on healthcare  voting rights  criminal justice and the climateby Tom McCarthy in New York, All new presidents change the courts by filling vacancies. But what is only now coming into focus is the impact that Trump’s unprecedented number of judicial appointments is having on the courts  ruling by ruling  and on the day-to-day lives of Americans  in areas such as healthcare  voting rights  criminal justice  anti-discrimination efforts and the climate. “The change is happening. It’s happening before our very eyes ” said Sheldon Goldman  a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. While the US supreme court is the country’s highest judicial authority and attracts most national and international attention  it is the country’s appeals courts that have the last word on justice in the vast majority of cases. They hear thousands of cases each year  compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system  federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans. Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges  faster  than any president at a similar stage in history  a record he frequently gloats about and cannot resist inflating. Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges  or almost 30% of the entire bench  and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison  Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 – in eight years each. Trump’s judges  who can serve for life  have a starting median age of 48.2  compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush. As the country demographically becomes more diverse  they are predominantly male and white  and ideologically they tend to inhabit deep right field. Together  they are changing America. The Trump administration has come under fire for its dithering and denial in the face of the coronavirus pandemic since the first fatal case outside China was recorded on 2 February. But the White House has been a hive of focused activity when it comes to advancing judicial appointments. Keeping up a brisk clip established early in his presidency  Trump has advanced 19 judges to fill federal vacancies since early February  in unwavering pursuit of his grand project to impose a new  conservative cast on American justice. And even as the virus rages  the Senate majority leader  Mitch McConnell  has vowed to make confirming the judges the first order of business when the chamber reconvenes early next month. “My motto for the year is leave no vacancy behind ” McConnell said in a radio interview on Wednesday. “That hasn’t changed. The pandemic will not prevent us from achieving that goal.” The Guardian reviewed dozens of cases affected by Trump’s judges  which included creating majorities in rulings that targeted immigrants and workers and undermined protections for society’s most vulnerable. They have: “We had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench  just from their records ” said Marge Baker  executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW)  which has just unveiled a report called Shredding the Social Safety Net on “the Republican plot to use federal courts to destroy public health”. “This administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration  we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.” A clear example of the impact of Trump’s judicial project was seen last spring  when the Trump administration stepped up its war on reproductive rights with new regulations gagging healthcare providers from fully counseling millions of mostly low-income women about their options while pregnant. The new rules threatened to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and other facilities that offer abortion services alongside healthcare subsidized by federal funds. As with Trump’s original travel ban  the family planning regulations seemed clearly illegal  with a decades-old reef of legislation protecting healthcare funding from just such attacks by conservative activists. Three western states immediately sued  and before long a trio of district courts had issued injunctions suspending the new Trump rules. The cases landed on appeal as a package last summer before the ninth circuit court  one of the 13 federal appeals courts  a step below the US supreme court  which are the last stop for justice in almost every case. Once upon a time  Trump would have  literally  cursed the venue. District judges in the ninth circuit  historically among the most progressive in the nation  had been fastest to block his travel ban and challenge his incursions on immigration  LGBTQ and voting rights. In 2018  when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications  Trump tweet-raged that “the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster” and “out of control” with “a horrible reputation”. In the last two years  however  the ninth circuit has changed. Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit  which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year  two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel. In late February  the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts  the ruling greenlighted Trump’s family planning restrictions – with the sure result  in the words of dissenting Judge Richard Paez  that “women and their families will suffer for it”. “The majority disregards 20 years of progress  insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present ” Paez wrote. He quoted a district judge in Oregon: “This is madness.” But as shocking as the ruling might have been  scholars saw in the ninth circuit decision a clear augury  “a precursor for what we’re likely to see in the future ” according to Carl Tobias  a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection. “That’s a classic case that shows you how much power these new judges have ” Tobias said. “That’s a concrete example of the changing dynamics of that court.” In case after case  the rulings of Trump’s picks represent not the preference of a majority of the public  but the preference of a shrinking American conservative minority whose grip on power runs through the US Senate and its exclusive power to confirm federal judges  here exploited mightily. The latest census projections in 2018 suggested that the US will become “minority white” in 2045  yet Trump’s judges are almost uniformly white and male  in direct opposition to the changing demographics of the country. Experts caution that many Trump appointees are very recent arrivals on the bench and the extent to which they have shifted or will shift the law of the land won’t be clear for five years or more. Most circuit court rulings are made by panels of three judges selected from each court’s total judges pool  averaging 13 in number  and Trump judges don’t rule on every case. Likewise  the addition of a Trump judge to a court does not necessarily change its overall balance. In fact  a 63% majority of Trump judges replaced judges who had been appointed by previous Republican presidents  according to analysis by Russell Wheeler  a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute. “I think it’s just a little early to begin making determined judgments about how much things have changed on the courts of appeals ” Wheeler said. But the data is beginning to pile up  in rulings starting at the top – the supreme court  where Trump has installed two justices out of nine  Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. In the last two years  Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have joined controversial decisions on voter purges  immigration  public unions  prisoners’ rights  Trump’s travel bans  the environment and more. In March  the pair for the first time heard oral arguments in a major abortion case that could undermine Roe v Wade. Supreme court decisions draw a lion’s share of public attention  but the circuit courts have an arguably greater role in shaping daily life  and recent circuit rulings give plenty of cause for alarm  said Baker. “Everything that people think of and care about in terms of quality of their daily lives – access to healthcare  access to clean water to drink and clean air to breathe  protections in the workplace from discrimination  the ability to marry the person they love and be free from discrimination whether it’s based on their gender or race or status as an LGBTQ person – all of that the courts are deciding on a daily basis ” Baker said. To capture a picture of how Trump’s judges are changing the country  Baker’s organization has built an interactive catalog called Confirmed Judges  Confirmed Fears. The database includes analysis of rulings by Trump judges sortable by topic and by judge name. “The increase in the number of Trump judges means you have more and more cases where you might very well have two Trump judges in the majority” on a three-person panel  said Elliott Mincberg  a senior fellow at PFAW. “And that’s happening more and more.” Meanwhile traditionally more conservative circuits  such as the New Orleans-based fifth circuit  have taken a noticeably hardline turn under Trump judges (the fifth circuit has five out of 17  with one vacancy about to be filled by a sixth Trump nominee). In December  a Trump judge on the court joined a two-to-one majority attacking Obama’s healthcare law  ruling that the former “individual mandate” to carry health insurance was unconstitutional. Other judges on the court have joined controversial opinions on border wall construction  voting rights and fair housing. Even in cases where Trump judges replaced judges appointed by an earlier Republican  Trump’s judges as a group espouse a more extreme conservative philosophy – which may be enhanced in practice if the judges see their appeals court jobs as tryouts for the US supreme court. “I’m sure that at least some of them are doing their judging with one eye on the health of Ruth Ginsburg and Steve Breyer ” said Wheeler. “Wondering  ‘what can I do to persuade the administration that I’d be a great person to appoint to the supreme court?’” In critiquing the recent ninth circuit decision on family planning  Paez warned that Trump’s judges were seeking to turn back the clock of American jurisprudence. “The majority would return us to an older world  one in which a government bureaucrat could restrict a medical professional from informing a patient of the full range of healthcare options available to her ” he wrote. “I strongly dissent.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba4259f857baed575f2195ba2022afddcab002c/218_246_3074_1846/master/3074.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1cf65422e494cc9ee2a5faf483c9fedd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70099cc4acb006157a97e6d350d0d59004d341eb/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c54da376b12f9e0813c80c0b891ce05 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6/0_260_6062_3638/master/6062.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dfa8eee3600e6eebdf98bbf01300fc37 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae693cf67675a1e7ab104313c04a22ed122393ff/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2cdf55d1b721ad6bec41cff9597814d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Donald+Trump%2CUS+supreme+court%2CLaw+%28US%29%2CRepublicans%2CUS+news%2CUS+immigration%2CReproductive+rights%2CLGBT+rights https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/cbi-report-reveals-uk-retailers-hit-by-covid-19-consumer-spending-collapse,business, UK retail suffering from collapse in consumer spending  says CBI, Two-thirds of firms say Covid-19 lockdown hit sales in worst month since financial crisis, April’s monthly health check of high street and online sales from the CBI reported that two-thirds of businesses had been adversely affected by the pandemic and almost all said they were experiencing cashflow problems. The employers’ organisation’s distributive trades survey polled 70 retailers in the three weeks after the UK economy’s enforced closure was announced and found that 71% said activity was down on a year earlier  compared with 16% reporting an increase. The balance of –55 points was the joint lowest since the survey was first published in 1983 and only matched by December 2008  shortly after the near-collapse of the global banking system. Every sector – even food and drink – reported an annual fall in sales  but outlets selling clothing and footwear  furniture and carpets and recreational goods were especially hard hit. Wholesalers and car dealers – also covered by the survey – had an even tougher start to the lockdown than retailers. The CBI said 79% of retailers were suffering from an annual fall in business against 11% reporting an increase  but every one of the 24 motor traders surveyed said activity was down. Despite some hints from government ministers that the lockdown might soon be relaxed  retailers were pessimistic about the chances of a pick-up in business. A balance of -54 percentage points said they anticipated a fall in annual sales in May – the weakest expectations in the survey’s history. According to the survey  which was carried out between 27 March and 15 April: Rain Newton-Smith  the CBI chief economist  said: “It’s no surprise that the lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two-fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell  suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit. “Although the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk  there are encouraging signs that the government’s job retention scheme is providing genuine relief  with many opting for temporary rather than permanent layoffs.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da6924b13762a54226fe8f90a8c8e3b85e94bf9/0_162_4858_2915/master/4858..jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48cf155ee97983d1c098cd2acbdf69d5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4319ef7a4b0718f50cb18edb105b571d84f82/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39f422c5de26d06554d18fc78800e51 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c0212224112595060ed17c4364a1de9e2abd7eb/0_222_6720_4036/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e94421c9d2a93d58bed423dc9fc22763 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30131b0f876693024fec5fcc9b458191e7c3459/0_116_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92c273e790bc4662e475c0b4fe9f8236 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d998f8ab42efd322602727e58ca6ff7ad32fb6d8/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da03dea9db86590a785c53e501bfd80c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Consumer+spending%2CRetail+industry%2CConfederation+of+British+Industry+%28CBI%29%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
29/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/extend-coronavirus-wage-subsidies-or-risk-delayed-redundancies-firms-warn,business, Extend coronavirus wage subsidies or risk delayed redundancies  firms warn, Employers say furlough scheme could become ‘waiting room for redundancies’ if it ends in June, Demanding the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  make urgent changes to protect workers  firms and the wider economy  the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said the Treasury’s multibillion-pound coronavirus job retention scheme needed to be made more flexible to allow furloughed staff to work reduced hours. It also said the scheme should run until at least the end of September to help firms through continuing lockdown measures or the gradual easing of tough controls on social and business activity across Britain. Warning that unemployment would shoot up this summer if the scheme closed at the end of June as planned  the trade body for human resources said a survey of more than 1 000 companies across Britain supported the move. Seven in 10 firms that have already furloughed staff said up to half their employees could work reduced hours if the scheme allowed. Pressure is mounting on the government to outline a more detailed exit strategy from lockdown  while Labour has called for more flexibility in the furlough scheme to help companies and people wanting to work limited hours. Peter Cheese  chief executive of the CIPD  said extending the scheme until at least September would give employers more certainty and remove the risk of a “cliff-edge exit” from furlough straight to redundancy. “Urgent decisions must now be taken to make it more flexible and to extend it so employers can continue to protect jobs ” he added. Extending the scheme would add significantly to the bill facing the exchequer for paying 80% of workers’ wages up to £2 500 per month. The government’s tax and spending watchdog  the Office for Budget Responsibility  estimated a cost of £42bn over three months to help 8.3 million people. It could cost a further £12bn for each additional month at this level  according to the Resolution Foundation. However  adjusting the scheme to give firms greater flexibility could cut the costs facing the public purse  as the financial aid could be scaled back as staff gradually return to work. Sunak dropped a clear hint on Monday that the scheme could be tweaked to allow for such changes. Speaking in parliament  he said “gradual refinements” were a key part of the government plan to end lockdown measures. There are early signs the furlough scheme has helped stop far greater numbers of redundancies as Britain slides into the worst recession in living memory  with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. According to a survey of around 700 of its members in the first week of the scheme’s operation  the British Chambers of Commerce said 76% of companies had furloughed at least some of their staff. It said almost no redundancies had been made by these firms. Adam Marshall  the director general of the BCC  also called for it to be extended: “While the furlough scheme cannot be indefinite  it will need to run well beyond 30 June in some form to help businesses transition toward a ‘new normal’ as the lockdown is eased.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f2c4a433a5207afd9fc42337e3e3030916711e/0_405_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7638b06191b78b4fb3b2493dc8d9b0b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Job+losses%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CRishi+Sunak%2CUK+news%2CWork+%26+careers%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomics%2CRecession%2CMoney%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/uk-consumers-big-weekly-shops-lockdown-stores,business, UK consumers choosing big weekly shops during lockdown, Convenience stores also get big boost as Britons spend £524m more on groceries this month, Latest figures from grocery analysts Kantar show shoppers spent £524m more on groceries so far in April  despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits dropped sharply. There was also a near 40% increase in convenience store sales as people turned to local shops to satisfy their daily needs. Fraser McKevitt  the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar  said: “People are spending more time at home and eating fewer meals out of the house  which has led to a strong growth in take-home grocery sales.” However physical distancing meant spending in other parts of the store  such as on clothing and takeaway fare such as sandwiches  salads and coffee  had collapsed  he said. Before the coronavirus struck Britons were increasingly doing small top-up shops but the return of the big shop was confirmed by the Tesco chief executive  Dave Lewis  who said the number of transactions in its stores had nearly halved in April but that the amount being bought on each trip had doubled. On average  British households went food shopping 14 times in April  which compares with 17 trips in more normal times. The drop was offset by a surge in the amount spent per trip  which reached £26. This is the highest figure ever recorded by Kantar and £7 greater than in 2019. The lockdown had also changed what people bought  with shoppers finding new ways to enjoy themselves while staying home. There had been a surge in demand for baking ingredients  with sales of suet up by 115% and sugar by 46%  according to Kantar. Over 40% of consumers it polled said they are doing more home baking now. The data showed grocery sales were 9.1% higher in the 12 weeks to 19 April than in 2019. It also showed this month the proportion of groceries bought online had exceeded 10% for the first time  as the major supermarkets added delivery slots to support self-isolating households. The over-65s in particular flocked online  almost doubling the amount they spent on food deliveries as the coronavirus forced them to stay at home. McKevitt said: “Retailers’ efforts to increase their online capacity are clearly working  with shopper numbers up by a quarter. Online sales now account for 10.2% of overall grocery  versus 7.4% last month  with the greatest increase among older shoppers.” Lewis told the BBC Tesco had doubled its online capacity since the outbreak began to one million orders a week. The supermarket would add a further 200 000 slots over the next 10 days  Lewis said  adding: “We’re trying to help as many people as we can. And the single biggest thing has been the change in online shopping.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7420f236013f93c0fe7e6e8a8d2ea339a65ff9ae/0_342_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=092c6d88c04b69dd85c4cc97d6b0cda4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42897a40bd244d54873699857529e9429bfa4aa5/0_155_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7094637a0a2d9bf327eabfcf4eef2f94 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88622903e3c40d16117d6108750a0216c790d84/0_40_4017_2410/master/4017..jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ff998343ad0cd8faad328f21e78b71c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf760a8033d07f85ce9d7ecee782ff6594f1b56/0_274_4016_2411/master/4016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76894bbe3f8d0ec565a971cbdd3bd260 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4319ef7a4b0718f50cb18edb105b571d84f82/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39f422c5de26d06554d18fc78800e51 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Retail+industry%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/thinktank-predicts-800bn-hit-to-economy-in-uk-over-next-10-years,business, Thinktank predicts £800bn hit to economy in UK over next 10 years, NIESR also says impact of coronavirus will lead to spike in unemployment to above 10%, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said it expected the economy to bounce back next year  but not to its previous level and with the unemployment rate still above 5% after hitting 10.5% this year. A second peak in the coronavirus outbreak or a prolonged shutdown into the summer would add between a third and a half more to the loss of income this year  NIESR added. In its twice yearly report  the thinktank said the efforts of the government to limit the economic impact of Covid-19 with loans  grants and guarantees to thousands of businesses would send public sector debt to 95% of GDP next year  12 percentage points above its current level. “The government’s announced measures to limit the long-term economic effect of Covid-19 have a direct cost to the exchequer of about £75bn in our main-case scenario. Borrowing is likely to rise above £200bn in 2020–21 ” it said. While analysts have expected an increase in public debt as a ratio of national income to near 100%  the prediction of an increase in unemployment to above 10% is gloomier than many other forecasts following a reluctance so far among employers to make staff redundant. The thinktank said it found it difficult to make a forecast for the economy while the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the UK and the rest of the world was still unknown  but estimating future growth provided a guide to the potential gains from managing the crisis with well-targeted state support schemes. “There is massive uncertainty about how long and how severe this crisis will be. For our reassuring main-case forecast scenario to come true it is necessary to believe that the complex network of relationships that make up the economy can be restored after the lockdown without any significant long-term damage ” said the NIESR deputy director  Garry Young. “So far the signs are promising  but the most significant challenges are likely to come as we approach the end or winding down of the lockdown and the supportive schemes are withdrawn. In those circumstances  the government schemes will need to be adapted to help businesses survive in a partially recovered economy.” The lockdown has pushed down the UK’s national income (GDP) by 30% and will leave the economy 7.5% smaller at the end of the year than when it started. Next year GDP will increase by 6.8%  NIESR said. The global economy will shrink by 3.5% compared with just 0.5% following the financial crash in 2008  before bouncing back by 7% next year. Earlier this month the International Monetary Fund said the global economy would shrink by 3%. • This article was amended on 29 April 2020.

28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/bp-plunges-into-first-quarter-loss-after-oil-price-collapse,business, BP plunges into first-quarter loss after oil price collapse, ‘Exceptionally challenging market’ blamed for loss but oil giant vows to still pay increased dividend, The collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic drove BP to a $628m (£505m) loss for the first quarter  compared with a profit of $2bn in the same period last year. BP said the “exceptionally challenging” market conditions caused the company’s underlying replacement cost profits  its preferred profit metric  to tumble by two-thirds to $791m for the quarter compared with $2.35bn last year. The oil giant told investors it faces an “exceptional level of uncertainty” and the risk of “more sustained consequences” ahead  including higher debt  lower spending and cuts to its workforce. But the FTSE 100 energy company will still pay shareholders  including thousands of retail investors and pension funds  a dividend for the past three months. “Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before  but that is no excuse to turn inward ” said BP boss Bernard Looney. “It is brutal  the future is unknowable  but equally I am confident that we will get through this.” BP will maintain its shareholder dividend for the quarter with a payout of 10.5 cents a share  up 2.4% from last year’s first-quarter payout  amid rising speculation that major oil firms will need to break a long-held taboo by cutting dividends to survive the coronavirus crisis. BP has cut its dividend only twice in the last 30 years  the latest was in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010  which led to 11 fatalities and financial costs of more than $65bn. “We have been tested many times over our history. But we always respond  and we know how to respond ” Looney told investors. The oil market crisis  which has caused prices to plummet to 21-year lows and even turn negative in the US  has emerged as BP prepares to undertake a major corporate overhaul to push it towards an ambition to be ‘net zero’ by 2050. Looney told the Guardian that no BP employees will leave the company over the next three months although job cuts are expected by the end of the year as part of the planned restructuring which remains on track. Analysts have warned that BP’s commitment to the dividend may come at a cost. BP’s debt has climbed by almost $6bn in recent months to reach $51.4bn in the first quarter. Analysts expect it will continue to rise over the year. “The key question at this point is how far BP is willing to push the balance sheet in order to protect its dividend ” said Biraj Borkhataria  an analyst at RBC Capital. “As if it does  it will likely spend the balance of 2020 and 2021 trying to pay down debt.” BP has also announced a 25% cut in spending in response to the coronavirus outbreak to around $12bn for 2020  and new borrowing facilities to increase its liquidity. Nicholas Hyett  equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown  said “drastic cuts” to BP’s spending plans “should help ease the pressure for now”. “But longer term the group needs higher oil prices or lower operating costs  and ideally both.” BP expects to be able to dramatically lower its costs so it can balance its books even from a breakeven oil price of $56 a barrel last year to $35 a barrel for 2020. The average oil price in the first quarter of the year was $50 a barrel  compared with $63 a barrel in the first quarter of 2019. In the last week the price of Brent crude  the international oil price benchmark  fell to $16 a barrel. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae8ff22d7e5de13678829a0be8efbde949a5a53/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7726a17e5dd769731bbd5e7d2cd7648a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=BP%2COil%2COil+and+gas+companies%2CEnergy+industry%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/fca-banks-covid-19-crisis,business, FCA warns banks not to put pressure on clients during Covid-19 crisis, Regulator says some lenders are using loan negotiations to secure extra services, The Financial Conduct Authority sent a strongly worded letter to bank chief executives on Tuesday  after hearing that some lenders were using loan negotiations to pressure corporate clients into hiring the banks for separate share sales. “We have heard credible reports of a small number of banks failing to treat their corporate clients fairly when negotiating new or existing debt facilities  as clients navigate the current exceptional circumstances ” the FCA said. “In particular  we have heard reports that banks may have used their lending relationship to exert pressure on corporate clients to secure roles on equity mandates that the issuer would not otherwise appoint them to.” In some cases  banks were asking for a role in the equity fundraising “in name only” and with few or no additional services offered in exchange. However  it meant the banks would still get a cut of the fees. “We will be looking into this further  but want any practice of this nature to cease immediately ” the FCA said. “If we find further evidence to support these concerns  we will not hesitate to take action  as this conduct has no place in well-functioning markets.” The regulator said forcing clients to take additional services  or demanding fees for services that were not delivered  risked distorting competition and undermining confidence in the market. It would be likely to increase overall costs for companies trying to raise emergency funds during the outbreak. The offending banks could be in breach of FCA rules that require lenders to act with integrity  prevent conflicts of interest and avoid drawing up contracts that would restrict which banks borrowers can work with in the future. Market abuse regulations also limit how banks use inside information – such as a planned share sale – that they might come across during debt negotiations It is understood the FCA has started directly contacting banks that have worked on recent share sales for companies to which they already lend. “We want to understand how you ensured your clients were treated fairly  and inside information was handled appropriately ” the regulator said. John Cronin  a financials analyst at stockbroker Goodbody  said: “I am not surprised to see the FCA seek to clamp down on these moves.” “It calls into question why certain businesses are being supported over others – at a particularly sensitive time given the public’s focus on the dearth of fresh lending under CBILS ” he said  referring to government-backed loans that banks have been slow to distribute. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e85bc2aa8b9fe81939651972851896dc31ab93/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a167bc7b628d382cd2d3581852f0063 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee39fd04130a88272e2fe82b7e235fd97aa78034/0_0_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=903134281fbed7f87dc69ffb5b3da74e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6789c4dfb66b3b7697aa323f6295efac10071833/0_125_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85ef805217051943cf2e742428bd7979 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da1058cdf5ee421da895e8ea81c7f96af2ec75da/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=693b1767f5bbf15fc7f26f8da992990a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1956ea97fc40ad57a1edb07310ef7f8c0c709e78/635_700_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0835acb8d583199331f2c58e48b0a5d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Financial+sector%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/hsbc-profit-coronavirus-outbreak-world-economies,business, HSBC could have to put aside £8.8bn to cover bad debts in coronavirus crisis, Bank’s profits halve as it says outlook for world economies has worsened in past two months, It would be the biggest provision for credit losses since the eurozone debt crisis in 2011  when the bank took a loan loss provision worth $12bn. On Tuesday  HSBC announced it had already taken a $3bn (£2.4bn) charge to help cover potential defaults by customers affected by the outbreak. It caused profits to fall 48% to $3.2bn for the three months to March. The loan loss provisions were far worse than the $1.8bn expected by analysts and $2.4bn higher than in the same period last year. HSBC said the extra charges were mainly due to the “global impact of Covid-19 and weakening oil prices”  but warned of further difficulties ahead. It also said fraud could rise during the crisis  leading to “potentially significant” loan loss charges. “The outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months. The impact and duration of the Covid-19 crisis will likely lead to higher ECL [expected credit losses] and put pressure on revenue due to lower customer activity levels and reduced global interest rates ” the bank said. Depending on the severity of the economic downturn  HSBC said loan loss provisions could surge to between $7bn to $11bn for full year 2020. The HSBC chief financial officer  Ewen Stevenson  said: “It’s very much premised on views on how long and how severe the economic impact is of Covid-19  and really the shape of the recovery that we see.” He explained that while China and Hong Kong may be on the path to recovery  western Europe  the UK and US may see their trough in the second quarter. “But then’s there’s a very wide spectrum of what happens [after] that including the risk of what’s called ‘the second wave’ in some countries.” He said the current crisis was “quite different” from that imagined by the Bank of England in its annual stress tests – also known as the annual cyclical scenario – which determine whether banks can weather a severe economic downturn. “We’re now seeing  for example  unprecedented levels of government support and intervention into the global economy  which wasn’t imagined in the ACS scenario ” Stevenson explained. The scenario also modelled a much more severe downturn in Asia  and much higher interest rates that would have pushed credit losses much higher  he added. The Bank of England has insisted that UK lenders are strong enough to survive the Covid-19 crisis  despite forecasting a “more severe” short-term impact than the latest stress tests were able to simulate. The bank said it plans to cut costs to help offset an expected drop in revenue and is bracing for a material drop in profitability in 2020. However  it has temporarily halted the majority of redundancies linked to its turnaround plan – which was expected to lead to about 35 000 job losses. In February  HSBC said it might have to put aside about $600m to cover the costs of bad debts arising from the pandemic. At that time  the disease was still largely contained in Asia and affecting the bank’s largest market  Hong Kong. The ringfenced UK bank accounted for $589m of first quarter provisions  two-thirds of which was aimed at consumer debts like mortgages and credit cards. However  Stevenson said some of that money had already been earmarked for potential hardship due to Brexit. HSBC said there was a heightened risk that businesses in some sectors may struggle to repay their debts. In the first stages of the outbreak  companies involved in the oil and gas industries  and the transport and consumer sectors have been hardest hit. But HSBC said the long-term impact of the outbreak on some industries was “uncertain” and may not be accounted for in its forecasts. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee39fd04130a88272e2fe82b7e235fd97aa78034/0_0_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=903134281fbed7f87dc69ffb5b3da74e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e85bc2aa8b9fe81939651972851896dc31ab93/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a167bc7b628d382cd2d3581852f0063 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6789c4dfb66b3b7697aa323f6295efac10071833/0_125_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85ef805217051943cf2e742428bd7979 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da1058cdf5ee421da895e8ea81c7f96af2ec75da/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=693b1767f5bbf15fc7f26f8da992990a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1956ea97fc40ad57a1edb07310ef7f8c0c709e78/635_700_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0835acb8d583199331f2c58e48b0a5d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=HSBC%2CBanking%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/executive-pay-capped-at-private-hospitals-during-nhs-coronavirus-takeover,business, Executive pay capped at private hospitals during NHS takeover, Government limits pay in return for state support as sector struggles for revenue during coronavirus crisis, Under a deal agreed last month  the government took over 8 000 private hospital beds  20 000 nurses and 700 doctors “at cost” for at least 14 weeks  in what was described as a de facto bailout for the companies. The temporary takeover was designed to provide extra healthcare facilities during a time of national crisis  but has also provided financial relief to the private hospital companies and their shareholders. The sector was facing a huge fall in revenues during lockdown  as non-emergency treatments were cancelled and foreign patients – who account for a significant proportion of private hospital income – were prevented from travelling to the UK. The 26 companies who signed up to the NHS deal cannot claim back costs for executive salaries higher than the pay of NHS trust bosses for the period that the NHS remains in control of their facilities  according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. The NHS will also not cover dividend payments to shareholders during the takeover period. The median annual pay of the chief executive of a very large acute NHS trust should be about £225 000  according to NHS guidance. Simon Stevens  the chief executive of NHS England  was entitled to a salary of up to £240 000 for the 2018-19 financial year. Although the median annual salary of a trust chief executive is almost eight times higher than the UK average  maintaining the pay cap over a 12-month period would represent a significant reduction for many private healthcare bosses whose pay deals are significantly bigger than their public-sector counterparts. Once the initial 14-week period of the deal expires  it can be extended on a weekly basis. For instance  Justin Ash  the chief executive of Spire Healthcare  received £1m in total pay for 2019. Spire said Ash and the chairman and finance director had each agreed a 20% pay cut for April  May and June. The highest-paid director of the UK subsidiary of private hospital owner Ramsay subsidiary received £1.1m in the year to June 2018. The highest-paid director at private equity-backed Circle Health  which is merging with privately held BMI Healthcare  was paid £561 000 in 2018. US-listed hospitals giant HCA Healthcare has cut pay for senior executives by 30%  while the highest-paid director of the UK subsidiary was paid £711 000 in 2018. However  the contracts are understood not to contain provisions relating to executive pay or bonuses beyond the period of NHS control  raising the possibility that some private hospital bosses could still receive large rewards during 2020  even though the companies may have struggled to hit targets or even survive without emergency help from the government or investors. There are also understood to be no limits on dividends beyond the period when the NHS has control of the hospitals  potentially allowing payments to shareholders to resume at a later point. Other countries such as France have plans to ban dividends from companies receiving state support. “There is no room for profits when precious resources are scarce and our key workers are on the frontline fighting the pandemic – with many losing their lives in the call of duty ” said Rehana Azam  national secretary at the GMB union  which represents some healthcare workers. David Hare  the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network  a lobby group for the industry  said: “As part of the recent historic deal whereby independent hospitals have put nearly all their capacity at the disposal of the NHS in responding to coronavirus  the public should be reassured that these additional resources are being reimbursed ‘at cost’ meaning no profit will be made.” Private hospitals owners and shareholders  their lenders and landlords stand to benefit from the deal more than the NHS  according to Vivek Kotecha  a researcher at the Centre for Health and the Public Interest  an independent thinktank. He said the deal was “in effect a bailout” and warned that the companies may still be able to pay bonuses once the NHS had ceded control. Shares in Spire Healthcare Group  which is listed on the London Stock Exchange  surged after the deal was announced in March. It acknowledged that the deal would provide it “sufficient liquidity and financial stability” to weather the outbreak  leaving it in a “strong position” to bounce back when it can restart non-NHS treatments. The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e22868d4e9bd7d348ebaa0279ff6e42e4b1a90/0_615_2133_1280/master/2133.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59104a8cfc661817b9764dff82c5d40a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Healthcare+industry%2CHealth+policy%2CBusiness%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CExecutive+pay+and+bonuses%2CPublic+services+policy%2CCorporate+governance%2CHospitals%2CNHS%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/ford-set-to-restart-main-european-car-factories-on-monday-4-may,business, Ford set to restart main European car factories on Monday 4 May, Production will begin slowly with UK plants remaining shut until later in the spring, The US car giant  which closed its European and North American factories at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March  said production would begin slowly with strict standards on social distancing and safety precautions. “We need to prepare for a new environment once we are past the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe  with the key priority in our ‘return to work’ plan being the implementation of Ford’s global standards on social distancing and strengthened health and safety protocols ” said Stuart Rowley  president of Ford of Europe. Ford factories in Saarlouis and Cologne in Germany  Valencia in Spain and Craiova in Romania  will reopen on Monday. Its engine plant in Valencia will open on 18 May. Ford said its plants in Dagenham  KentEssex  and Bridgend  Wales  would resume at “a later date”. It is understood that this is likely to be later in May. About 2 200 people normally work at the Dagenham plant  and 1 200 people at the Bridgend factory. Most have been placed on the government’s furlough scheme  with wages topped up to their base salaries by Ford. Safety measures include mandatory face masks  which the company will produce itself to “reduce demand on stretched supply chains for personal protection equipment also needed by medical services and other industries”. Work stations have been redesigned to ensure employees will be able to work at a distance from colleagues. All people entering Ford factories will have to have their body temperature checked and employees will also be required to fill out daily wellness self-assessment forms. “This is an unprecedented time for our business  but it is bringing out the very best in our people at Ford  so many of whom are engaged in supporting their communities in a multitude of actions across Europe ” Rowley said. Jaguar Land Rover  the UK’s biggest carmaker  plans to gradually reopen some factories on 18 May. The company’s Solihull plant  which employs 9 000 workers making its Range Rover models  will reopen with a quarter of its workers at first  alongside SUV plants in Slovakia and Austria. Vauxhall said it was ready to reopen its Ellesmere Port site south of the Wirral after setting out socially distanced production lines  break areas and restrooms. Aston Martin Lagonda said it would reopen its factory in St Athan  south Wales  on 5 May with new safety measures similar to those planned by Vauxhall. Japan’s Nissan warned on Tuesday that it it faces an annual loss of as much as 95bn yen (£700m) – it’s first full-year loss since the 2008 financial crisis. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52579a6679fe034ecd08e58c2c7cfae412ea5062/0_0_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2688759f73401edb97bc6cf4e534488e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Automotive+industry%2CFord%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CManufacturing+sector%2CUK+news%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/butterflywatch-continental-visitors-boost-springtime-boom,environment, Butterflywatch: continental visitors boost springtime boom, Dry  sunny spell lifts numbers but lockdown gardening and farm chemicals will keep wings clipped, Peacocks in particular seem to be booming  and so are orange tips. More thrilling are arrivals from the continent. Along the east coast from Yorkshire to Suffolk there has been a smattering of large tortoiseshell sightings. This big but enigmatic butterfly probably became extinct in Britain in the 1970s after Dutch elm disease decimated its major food source  but it has thrived in the Netherlands recently and easterly winds have brought it here. There’s also an influx of red admirals in western areas. Butterfly numbers build with a succession of favourable summers and so this summer (following 2019  which was the best butterfly year since 1997) could be superb. But fine weather can only do so much. Unfortunately  judging by the volume of mowing in my neighbourhood  lockdown will not boost butterflies. People are gardening more intensively  and chemical farming continues  unaffected by coronavirus. Fields near me stink of sprays that are a cause of the long-term decline of many insects. We can’t just rely on sunshine; we need to change our ways if butterflies are to bounce back for good. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Patrick-Barkham,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd5f1c33a4f20f7d330de3fd03bf6de6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6099fa42807d228b8ea132c1a08b4ea48e8dfc1d/0_95_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=687db6a5e171f9b89b90784065fc7784 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Wildlife%2CEnvironment https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/families-health-staff-die-coronavirus-get-60000-payouts-matt-hancock,world, Families of health staff who die of coronavirus to get £60 000 payouts, Matt Hancock says he feels ‘deep sense of duty’ to those infected while at work, The health and social care secretary said 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff have died during the crisis. “I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones ” he added. He announced the creation of a new life assurance scheme  funded by the taxpayer  which would support families. Hancock has repeatedly been challenged over whether frontline workers have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent them from contracting the disease. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference  where he announced an increase of 360 in the number of hospital deaths from the virus  Hancock said the NHS had been able to make treatment available to everyone who needed it  throughout the crisis. The health secretary announced the NHS would restart some non-urgent operations – and called on patients to continue using the health service as they normally would. Ministers are concerned that while it has suppressed Covid-19 cases  the lockdown is creating its own risks to public health because people are anxious about going to hospital with other conditions. “Our message is that the NHS is open: help us to help you ” Hancock said. He urged members of the public suffering chest pain  or who fear they may be having a stroke or heart attack  to use A&E. With the government weighing up how and when it can modify the stringent physical distancing measures imposed on 23 March  after Boris Johnson’s return to work  Hancock stressed it was too soon for the public to change their behaviour. “We’re coming through this peak ” he said. “It will count for nothing if we let this slip now and risk a second peak.” Hancock also answered a question from a member of the public for the first time at the press conference. Lynn from Skipton in North Yorkshire asked if allowing people to hug their grandchildren again would be one of the first steps as the restrictions are lifted. The chief medical officer  Prof Chris Whitty  signalled that older people who are vulnerable can expect to have to be “shielded” away from physical contact with their family for an extended period. “If she’s in a group which is vulnerable  then the answer is it might well be prudent for her not to get into a situation where she is putting herself at risk ” he said. “It is important that people who are vulnerable continue to be protected  even after whatever the next steps are  occur.” Hancock added: “We understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. If affects us  too.” , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CNHS%2CSocial+care%2CHealth%2CMatt+Hancock%2CChris+Whitty%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/ministers-meet-unions-and-business-to-plan-getting-uk-back-to-work,world, Ministers meet unions and business to plan getting UK back to work, Talks aimed at bringing in practices that reassure employees it is safe to leave lockdown, The Guardian has been told that both sides of industry have been drafted into seven sector-by-sector meetings chaired by the business secretary  Alok Sharma  in recent days – after concerns arose in Whitehall that many employees may be reluctant to return to the workplace  even when the government gives the green light. Measures under discussion include the use of face masks and hand sanitiser on public transport  one-in-one-out rules and socially distanced queues for non-essential shops  and revised operating procedures for building sites. Some construction projects halted as a result of the virus have already restarted. Boris Johnson urged Tory colleagues pressing for an immediate end to the lockdown to “contain your impatience” in a Downing Street address on his first day back at work on Monday  as the UK coronavirus hospital death toll passed 21 000. The prime minister said the country now had the opportunity to overcome Covid-19  but was at the “moment of maximum risk”. But he also pledged to “fire up the engines of this vast UK economy” as soon as it is safe to do so. No 10 previously had little time for either business groups such as the CBI – which it regarded as a hotbed of remainers – or the trades unions. Yet  since the onset of the crisis  both groups have been closely involved in drawing up chancellor Rishi Sunak’s economic rescue package – and they are now helping to prepare the ground for what Johnson called the “refining” of lockdown restrictions. While Tory donors and backbenchers have been calling for economic activity to resume as soon as possible  polling suggests strong support for lockdown measures remains  and government insiders pointed to so-called “over-compliance” with the restrictions already in place. When schools were ordered to stay open for key workers’ children  ministers expected perhaps a fifth of pupils to attend – but the actual figure has been just 1% as concerned parents have kept the vast majority at home. Getting schools up and running again – and persuading parents their children will be safe – is regarded by ministers as a necessary precondition for allowing many people to return to work. Schools are not expected to reopen fully until June  after the spring half-term. In a characteristically upbeat statement delivered outside Downing Street two weeks after he was discharged from hospital following intensive care treatment for coronavirus  Johnson compared the virus to “an unexpected and invisible mugger”. “This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk ” he said. He said it was too soon to say when the lockdown measures would be altered. Addressing those calling for an early lifting of the restrictions  he said: “I entirely share your urgency. It’s the government’s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike; the risk of losing control of that virus. “That would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy  and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage.” The government’s scientific advisers are working to model the potential impact on R0 – the infection rate of the virus – of lifting different restrictions. The chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  said on Monday it was not yet clear how much difference reopening schools would make  for example. He said the Sage committee of scientists  of which he is a member  would present ministers with estimates of the impact of various measures in the coming days – allowing the politicians to make decisions of how to adjust the lockdown. Echoing the language used by Dominic Raab  deputising for the prime minister  on Sunday  Johnson said the government would “refine” the stringent distancing restrictions imposed on 23 March  which are due to be reviewed by Thursday next week. Conservative campaign chief Isaac Levido is involved in the task of replacing the government’s “Stay Home  Protect the NHS  Save Lives” slogan with a more nuanced message for what Johnson repeatedly called the “second phase” of the crisis. Sunak disclosed on Monday that 4m workers had been furloughed under the government’s unprecedented job retention scheme  in which the taxpayer underwrote the costs of paying staff wages as they are temporarily laid off. He also announced the creation of a new loans scheme for the smallest businesses  which will be 100% guaranteed by the government. Johnson stressed his determination to build a consensus over future measures  saying he would include opposition parties in his deliberations. Keir Starmer  the Labour leader  has so far adopted a cautiously supportive approach to the government’s handling of the crisis  while pressing ministers on specific issues including testing and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline health workers. Frances O’Grady  general secretary of the Trades Union Congress  said: “Protecting workers’ safety and rebuilding the economy must go hand in hand. “That’s why we have called on government to set up a national recovery council with unions and employers. Any business that refuses to put in place safe systems of work should face the threat of prosecution.” The health secretary  Matt Hancock  announced on Monday that some hospital treatment halted because of the virus  including cancer care  will now be progressively resumed. Presenting the daily Downing Street press conference  Hancock stressed that the NHS remained open  and urged the public to continue to make use of it as usual. Ministers are concerned that while it has suppressed Covid-19 cases  the lockdown is creating its own risks to public health because people are anxious about going to hospital with other conditions. “Our message is that the NHS is open: help us to help you ” Hancock said. He urged members of the public suffering chest pains  or who fear they may be having a stroke or heart attack  to use A&E. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513d86d76d323aa776b9589b2e2f0f4a9d5544b5/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b94d9dc2555745f98bf7b38cdc96e7c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CTrade+unions%2CAlok+Sharma%2CBoris+Johnson%2CRishi+Sunak%2CSchools%2CNHS%2CMatt+Hancock https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/families-of-nhs-and-care-staff-who-died-from-covid-19-to-get-60000,world, Grieving NHS families say £60 000 cannot make up for loss, Relatives of staff who died of virus welcome new payouts but warn focus must be on PPE, The health and social care secretary  Matt Hancock  said families will receive the payment as part of a “life assurance scheme” and expressed a “deep personal sense of duty” to care for their relatives. Amid criticism over the failure to provide frontline workers with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing  he admitted that “nothing replaces the loss of a loved one”. Relatives of those who have died welcomed the money but said it would not make up for their loss  and warned it should not distract from the need to protect those working alongside coronavirus patients. They added a hope that the new scheme would be easily accessed and open to everyone  and that the government would value NHS workers more in future. Michael Tun  whose father Dr Peter Tun  a neuro rehabilitation specialist at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading who died aged 62 after contracting coronavirus  said: “I would rather have my dad than the money”. He added: “These new payments are welcome. And I’m sure they will help a lot of families. But they shouldn’t distract from the key issues around PPE  including the continuing shortages - real attention should be given to that - the distribution of it and how the guidelines are formed  followed and interpreted [by hospitals]. “There needs to be accountability over the guidelines. I would rather have my dad than the money  absolutely  100%.” Intisar Chowdhury  the son of Abdul Mabud Chowdhury  a consultant urologist who died aged 53 at Queen’s Hospital in Romford  east London  after warning the prime minister over the lack of PPE  said: “While my family and I really do appreciate the government’s efforts to help out the families of loved ones that have died in the pandemic  it doesn’t cover up the fact that there haven’t been neither public nor private apologies in which politicians have acknowledged they have made a mistake in handling the response to the virus. “None of us are expecting perfection from politicians: we’re just expecting progression  meaning mistakes are completely acceptable - as long as they acknowledge them  apologise for them and learn from them.” Amal El-Hawrani  the youngest sibling of Amged El-Hawrani  a 55-year-old ENT consultant from Queen’s Hospital in Burton who died from coronavirus  said: “We welcome the initiative. It is more relevant to my sister in-law and nephew who don’t want to speak to the media but on their behalf would welcome any contribution from the government to recognise the sacrifice loved ones made not just now but throughout whole time working for the NHS.” He added: “But what is more important is that the government appreciate doctors and nurses going forward. They have had a hard time for the last 15-20 years – they had a 1% cap on [the] limit for salaries  and they tried to lift that and the current government voted against that. There is nothing more noble than what they do  everything for [the] benefit of others  but so harshly treated … We hope to see something long-term for their benefit  large increases in their salaries.” There were also worries about the scheme. The family of Donald Suelto  51  who died alone after treating a patient infected with coronavirus at Hammersmith hospital in London  said that they hope they would qualify despite failing to get his death certificate. “We can prove Donald died of Covid-19 but we are struggling at the moment to get his death certificate ” said Ian Robertson  the husband of Suelto’s niece Emylene Suelto Robertson. “I fear the government will make it hard for people to prove they deserve the money  there will be some nurses who died in the community who will not get the £60 000. I am not trying to be negative. It’s good but I am worried it will be hard for families to get it.” Hancock said that 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff have died during the pandemic. A Guardian count has recorded 119 deaths of health professionals while Nursing Notes  a platform run by nurses for others in the profession  has found that at least 134 health and care workers have died of coronavirus. The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began  verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family  friends or colleagues. Hancock has repeatedly been challenged over whether frontline workers have adequate PPE to prevent them from contracting the disease. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference  where he announced an increase of 360 in the number of hospital deaths from the virus  Hancock said the NHS had been able to make treatment available to everyone who needed it  throughout the crisis. He said the government wanted to do “everything that we can” to support families dealing with bereavement. “I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones.” He added: “We are also looking at which other groups of key workers that applies to who don’t have a scheme already in place.” Donna Kinnair  chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN)  said: “No amount of cash can make up for a family member who passes away but financial security should never add to the worries of those in grief. “The RCN and other health unions fought for this government announcement and we will examine the detail closely. It must be easily accessed  open to those in social care and primary care too and be paid promptly – no family should face a lengthy or complex process.” Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: “It is welcome that the government has listened to workforce representatives and ensured that death-in-service benefits are available to everyone working in the NHS and social care sector. “Now the government must finally get a grip over PPE supplies so that NHS and care staff aren’t putting their lives on the line to do their job and protect the rest of us.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/314c211a4d4cfd64914195fd877076ba08b836bc/75_0_3313_1989/master/3313.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55751d2f2cde6677ee85cfc2f4fb4c0b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e283f86e09d4e218e8896f44af64421a9525ac/0_222_6662_3997/master/6662.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de91ceb7253f0083c26b31a48a9422e0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CMatt+Hancock%2CNHS%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/27/schools-shutdown-likely-to-widen-attainment-gap-says-ofsted-chief,education, Schools shutdown likely to widen attainment gap  says Ofsted chief, MPs hear that it is in children’s interests to return to school as soon as possible, Amanda Spielman  who heads the schools inspectorate Ofsted  said the Covid-19 pandemic would further disadvantage the poorest  lowest-achieving and least motivated children. “Whether we like it or not  it is going to widen gaps  especially in the short term ” she said. Giving evidence to the cross-party education select committee on Monday  Spielman was questioned about a wide range of issues in addition to school closures  including relationships and sex education  illegal schools and Ofsted’s approach to faith schools. At one point she clashed with the Tory chair of the committee  Robert Halfon  when he appeared to defend a state-funded Jewish faith school where Ofsted inspectors found that information about Elizabeth I had been redacted from school books. Halfon said the Yesodey Hatorah senior girls’ school  serving the Orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Stamford Hill  north London  denied allegations that teaching materials were censored and that women including Elizabeth I were airbrushed out of history  and he suggested reopening a dialogue with the school. Spielman stood by the Ofsted report  however  and said it was not just a case of a single image of Elizabeth I being censored because it was immodest  as the school had claimed  but that “an entire chunk of history” had been taken out. The school was judged “inadequate” following the inspection in March 2018. MPs on the committee were in the main keen to explore the impact of the pandemic on disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils  about whom concerns have been growing since schools closed five weeks ago. Figures published by the Department for Education last week showed that just 5% of vulnerable children entitled to a place in temporary emergency schools were turning up. Spielman told the committee she was “seriously concerned” about the impact of school closures on the most disadvantaged children. Asked about the closure of alternative provision for children who have struggled in mainstream schools  she said: “The longer the closure  or almost closure  the greater the problems for those children.” She continued: “We know that home and online learning are very imperfect substitutes for the school experience. We know that children are losing education. It is not just children who are disadvantaged or academically behind  it is children without motivation. So it is in children’s interests to get back into school as soon as possible.” Halfon also challenged Spielman on what Ofsted would do to ensure vulnerable children get the education and support they need to catch up. “My concern  from what you have said so far  is that there doesn’t seem [to be] from Ofsted a special focus on the left-behind children … and a special effort to make sure they catch up when schools reopen ” he said. Spielman said Ofsted’s inspection framework already focused on children who face the greatest difficulties in their education. She also told MPs she did not expect Ofsted to resume full routine inspections before the end of the summer term. They were suspended in March as a result of the pandemic. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d820573af38f1c17f49712a26f8a370b450d69/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a07a7532c185609c8af257c1b5d5956e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ofsted%2CSchools%2CAmanda+Spielman%2CSocial+mobility%2CChildren%2CEducation%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus,world, At least 12 UK children have needed intensive care due to illness linked to Covid-19, Patients may have new type of toxic shock syndrome  which causes pain and inflammation, The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. All have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment  which is used when someone’s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. NHS bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the emergence of these cases and asked them to urgently refer any children with similar symptoms to hospital. Most of the children affected have Kawasaki disease  a rare vascular condition that is the main cause of acquired heart disease in under-18s in the UK. There are estimated to be 4.5 cases for every 100 000 children under the age of 18 in the UK. “These cases happen when someone with Kawasaki disease gets Covid-19 and that produces complications ” said one NHS source. In a letter to GPs in north London  reported by the Health Service Journal   NHS bosses said: “It has been reported that over the last three weeks there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK. “The cases have in common overlapping feature of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe Covid-19 in children. “There is a growing concern that a Sars-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK  or that there may be another  as yet unidentified  infectious pathogen associated with these cases.” A version of the warning has been sent by the Paediatric Intensive Care Society to all specialist doctors working in paediatric intensive care units in UK hospitals. The NHS letter adds that while some of the children did have Covid-19  others had tested negative for it. That could suggest that that group did not have it  or had had it  or that their tests were faulty. Describing the illness  the letter added: “Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature  as has cardiac inflammation. This has been observed in children with confirmed PCR positive Sars-CoV-2 infection as well as children who are PCR negative. Serological evidence of possible preceding Sars-CoV-2 infection have also been observed.” Sars-CoV-2 is the official name of the virus that causes the disease Covid-19. Doctors have been told to “please refer children presenting with these symptoms as a matter of urgency”. One intensive care doctor said: “There’s been an utterly unexpected uptick in severely sick children with a late inflammatory response that we think is related to Covid-19. It’s most unusual.” It is not known if any of the children have died. “This is not something people should be panicking about ” said Dr Liz Whittaker  a consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London and a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health’s allergy  immunology and infectious diseases committee. Asked at the Downing Street daily press briefing about the reports  the health secretary  Matt Hancock  said they had left him “very worried”  while the government’s chief medical officer  Prof Chris Whitty  said: “This is a very rare situation but I think it is entirely plausible that this is caused by this virus  at least in some cases.” The condition came to light when doctors saw a number of unusual cases of children admitted to intensive care with a mix of symptoms from toxic shock and Kawasaki syndrome. The children had persistent fevers and severe abdominal pain and some had skin rashes. What concerned doctors most were blood tests that revealed severe inflammation  similar to that seen in adult patients with severe Covid-19 infections. Of the children admitted to intensive care  a number needed treatment for heart inflammation. “Our worry is that paediatricians who see children with fever and abdominal pain will do blood tests to look for problems such as appendicitis  but might not do bloods that look for inflammatory issues ” Whittaker said. Doctors suspect that the illness may be a “post-infection inflammatory response” where the immune system goes into overdrive. While some children have tested negative for coronavirus  they may have cleared the virus before the inflammation took hold  or the tests may simply have missed the infection. Prof Russell Viner  the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health  sought to reassure parents that children are generally unlikely to become very unwell due to Covid-19. “We already know that a very small number of children can become severely ill with Covid-19 but this is very rare. Evidence from throughout the world shows us that children appear to be the part of the population least affected by this infection. “New diseases may present in ways that surprise us  and clinicians need to be made aware of any emerging evidence of particular symptoms or of underlying conditions which could make a patient more vulnerable to the virus. However  our advice remains the same: parents should be reassured that children are unlikely to be seriously ill with Covid-19  but if they are concerned about their children’s health for any reason they should seek help from a health professional.” The RCPCH’s guidance for parents on symptoms and seeking advice is available here. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dd04ba0f855de4ed59f66c6e3f879e8da309c08/0_142_5670_3402/master/5670.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3e5f8f5ca34a92bf003e2ad3be6a824 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CChildren%2CUK+news%2CNHS%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/the-films-that-made-us-bfi-to-archive-best-coronavirus-videos,film, The films that made us: BFI to archive best coronavirus videos, From Joe Wicks’s PE to Boris Johnson’s video tweets  BFI is accepting recommendations, Anxious to document a unique moment of history  the BFI has announced details of a “rapid response” plan to collect in its archive the best of those videos. It wants the public to make recommendations  whether it is a film that made them laugh or cry or simply shamed them to stop panic-buying. Will Massa  a contemporary curator at the BFI  said it had been collecting online video for a number of years but the coronavirus crisis and lockdown had brought about a “tidal wave” of important new content. It provides a window into the national psyche like never before  he said. “Even though we are mainly isolated in our own homes there is this sense of digital connectivity that is definitely new with regard to a feeling of nationhood. “Ten years ago we wouldn’t have been experiencing something like this in quite the same way. We certainly wouldn’t have had an insight  in quite the same way  into the public mood.” Choosing and collecting the videos is challenging simply because there is so much of it. “We realised quickly that we wanted to get on top of this not least because online video  in its very nature  can be quite precarious. We’ve all had the experience of seeing a video one week and trying to find it the next.” One of Massa’s favourite films is a campaign video made by the stage director and musician Tom Guthrie to help raise awareness of the plight of freelance musicians. The adaptation of Pete Seeger’s Where Have All the Flowers Gone brought a tear to his eye  he said. “It really says something about the way in which we are able to connect digitally and why this form of moving image is distinct from things that have come before it.” The BFI expects to collect about 100 videos as part of the project  and curators have come up with their own suggestions to kickstart the public campaign. They include: Massa said he was confident future generations would look back and be struck by the sheer talent of people under lockdown. “I have been really impressed with the skills of people. The creativity which has been stimulated is really amazing ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1783de44e2f3c84446a44a56e263bad8efe835/0_100_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b06213de609b14c97ebec3989b926319 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=BFI%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CFilm%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/27/silence-is-golden-for-whales-as-lockdown-reduces-ocean-noise-coronavirus,environment, Silence is golden for whales as lockdown reduces ocean noise, Curtailing of shipping due to coronavirus allows scientists to study effects of quieter oceans on marine wildlife, Researchers examining real-time underwater sound signals from seabed observatories run by Ocean Networks Canada near the port of Vancouver found a significant drop in low-frequency sound associated with ships. David Barclay  assistant professor of oceanography at Dalhousie University  the co-author of a paper reviewing the phenomena  examined sound power – a way of measuring “loudness” – in the 100 Hz range from two sites  one inland and one farther offshore. He found a significant drop in noise from both. “Generally  we know underwater noise at this frequency has effects on marine mammals ” Barclay said. The findings of Barclay and his researchers were first published in The Narwhal. “There has been a consistent drop in noise since 1 January  which has amounted to a change of four or five decibels in the period up to 1 April ” he said. Economic data from the port showed a drop of around 20% in exports and imports over the same period  he said. The deep ocean site  around 60km from the shipping lanes and in 3 000 metres of water  also showed a drop in average weekly noise of 1.5 decibels  or around a 15% decrease in power  Barclay said. “This gives us an idea of the scale over which this reduction in noise can be observed.” The reduction in ship traffic in the ocean  which Barclay compares to a “giant human experiment”  has had scientists racing to find out the effect on marine life. “We are facing a moment of truth ” said Michelle Fournet  a marine acoustician at Cornell University  who studies humpback whales in south-east Alaska. “We have an opportunity to listen – and that opportunity to listen will not appear again in our lifetime.” Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11  when ship and air traffic fell in North America  US researchers were similarly able to study whales in a quieter ocean  with a landmark study concluding that ship noise was associated with chronic stress in baleen whales. “We have a generation of humpbacks that have never known a quiet ocean ” said Fournet  whose work has shown that the whales alter their calling behaviour in response to a noisy ocean. Late April usually marks the beginning of the cruise ship season in south-east Alaska  with the boats docking at Vancouver before heading north. This year the health crisis has halted them. “What we know about whales in south-east Alaska is that when it gets noisy they call less  and when boats go by they call less ” said Fournet. “I expect what we might see is an opportunity for whales to have more conversation and to have more complex conversation.” Ocean scientists worldwide  many of whom are unable to carry out practical work due to the pandemic  are desperate to collect data from this once-in-a lifetime opportunity to listen. Nathan Merchant  a bioacoustics expert at the UK government’s Centre for Environment  Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Lowestoft  said: “We are on tenterhooks waiting to see what our records are saying.” Cefas has hydrophones to collect noise date on four sites: two in the North Sea  one in Plymouth and one near Bangor. Merchant said there have been international efforts to coordinate the work of monitoring underwater noise. “We will be looking at how the coronavirus is affecting underwater noise throughout Europe  so this work out of Canada will be the first of many ” he said. He and his colleagues have long been discussing how they could ever conduct an experiment to make the ocean quieter  in order to find out what benefit it would have. “We have this natural experiment going on. Of course it is a terrible crisis  but we may as well get on and look at the data  to find out what effect it is having.” , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/17/Sep/2018/25703364-a145-46b0-bcd0-bcd1dd5f571b-seascape-color-logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c2b2b9be09c65b41c7d3050dc397045efb33ac/1254_471_3256_1957/master/3256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8c17294a45d7c9a4986e7f54eeebe1e6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Marine+life%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2COceans%2CEnvironment%2CCanada%2CAnimals%2CWildlife%2CWhales%2CCetaceans%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnsons-post-coronavirus-speech-what-he-said-what-it-means,politics, Boris Johnson's post-coronavirus speech: what he said  and what it means, PM spoke of success and lockdown  shielding the NHS  transparency and freedom, “Turning the tide” would mean that hospital admissions had decreased and the death toll had fallen persistently over a two-week period. The death toll was 413 in the 24 hours preceding Sunday  which is the lowest since the end of March  and a good sign. However  there were 449 deaths on 20 April followed by 828 the next day  so what the country needs is a sustained fall  not a yo-yoing of results. Johnson is right to say hospital admissions have fallen; Stephen Powis  the national director of Public Health England  said on Sunday: “We now have a very definite trend in the reduced number of people in hospitals with Covid-19.” The phrase “invisible mugger” is quite Trumpian in tone – the US president refers to the illness as the “invisible enemy”. The word success here will be controversial  even if he is using it narrowly in relation to moving through the peak and having not overwhelmed the NHS. The government’s chief medical officer  Prof Chris Whitty  said a death toll under 20 000 would “be a good result” but the UK has already passed that  and that is without counting the number of deaths outside hospitals  including in care homes. There have also been problems getting personal protective equipment to the health and care workers who need it  and concerns over the government’s slow response on testing. Phase one refers to the first peak of the infection and the UK is believed to be working its way out of this subject to passing five tests  which include no chance of a second spike and sorting out testing and PPE. Phase two refers to the plans that will be in place beyond the strict lockdown period while the government still pursues suppression of the virus and keeping the R-number as lower than one. To say the country is set to “prevail” feels incongruous with the death rate  which is one of the highest in Europe  the complaints about PPE and the fact it is still unknown whether Britain will reach its 100 000-a-day test target by Thursday. He is right to say that the NHS has not collapsed and significant efforts were made to build up the number of critical care beds with the opening of the Nightingale hospitals in London  Birmingham  Manchester and Harrogate. Mass procurement of ventilators has been complex  with not as many needed as first envisaged because of doctors learning more about the type of oxygen treatment needed. Dyson invested £20m in new ventilator technology asked for by the government but in the end it has not been used. Saying the NHS has been shielded could be seen as insensitive considering the number of doctors  nurses and other health workers who have died while working on the frontline. This might be a reference to the increasing frustration that the government has said consistently that it is “following the science” to make decisions  but that this science is not available for public scrutiny. The government may have read the mood on this one and changed its stance. It is also not known exactly who is on the scientific advisory group  Sage  although the Guardian revealed that Johnson’s chief adviser  Dominic Cummings  had been in attendance on what was supposed to be an independent body. It was unclear from Johnson’s statement how far he was prepared to go in terms of transparency. Although conversations have been going on between Johnson and the Labour leader  Keir Starmer  it was not clear whether the prime minister was indicating an increase in contact  or just keeping opposition parties in the loop. If it is to include Labour  for example  in shouldering the responsibility of some policy decisions  that would be a dramatic change. Johnson is a libertarian at heart and has made much use of the language of freedom being curtailed and how it pains him personally. This kind of language is a flash of the prime minister’s own take on how people might feel about lockdown  although polling has shown that many are content with the restrictions and have not found them onerous. In fact  a Deltapoll survey showed that moving too quickly to lift restrictions was a significant worry for the British public across all generations and political groups. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/a-deflated-johnson-struggles-to-muster-his-usual-ebullience,politics, A deflated Johnson struggles to muster his usual ebullience, A low-key speech on the PM’s first day back offered no apologies for the government’s coronavirus policies, Given that it’s only two weeks since he came out of intensive care  this was unsurprisingly very much a Boris-lite appearance. Literally so  for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large  his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim. Nor were there any of the familiar upbeat enthusiasm and ebullience to his speech. The references to Churchill all fell rather flat and his performance seemed to be geared towards reminding himself as much as the country that he was back in charge. On the upside  even an underpowered Boris is an improvement on Priti Patel or Grant Shapps. He was here because he was here. That seemed to be the main thrust of what he had to say. He was grateful to the NHS  he was grateful to the public for by and large containing their impatience with lockdown – though the internal battle between his own cabinet on the timing of any relaxation in the guidance seems to have encouraged more people to make up their own rules – and we were making progress against the coronavirus mugger. Not exactly the best analogy to use  as the most sensible advice when faced with a bloke with a six-inch knife is to give him whatever he wants. In Boris World  a mugging is just a harmless duffing up by the Bash Street Kids. “Many will be looking at our apparent success ” Boris continued. At which the only sound to be heard was of jaws hitting the pavement. To be fair  even he looked a bit embarrassed at that line. So far  the UK has recorded more than 20 000 coronavirus deaths in hospital and possibly as many as that again at home and in care homes. Which would already be roughly the number of civilians who died during the Blitz in the second world war  with the prospect of many thousands still to follow. If that’s a success  I’d hate to see what failure looked like. Or perhaps  the prime minister regards it as a matter of honour to top the European mortality figures. Either way  most other countries will be looking at the UK as an object lesson in how not to handle a pandemic. What followed was  in its way  just as startling. In claiming to have protected the NHS by flattening the levels of infection  he completely forgot to mention his government’s own negligence in failing to provide adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for NHS staff and care home workers. Nor did he offer any explanation or apology for his failure to take the coronavirus seriously right from the start of the pandemic  a decision that may have cost many thousands of lives. Nor was there any recognition that other countries that had implemented a rigorous “test  track and trace” policy had achieved far more success in containing the coronavirus. Or that his 250 000 daily testing target had always been bollocks. As so often  it was the subtext of what Johnson didn’t say that provided by far the more informative meta narrative. By now  Boris was beginning to develop a hunted look in his eyes. His own brush with death has provided him with just a hint of conscience previously absent throughout his political career. The eyes are a window into a very troubled soul. He can sense the stench of battery chickens staying at home to roost. He talked of transparency when his government has done everything it could to keep Dominic Cummings’s role in the Sage meetings secret. He talked of bringing in opposition parties  though none would do so without first making clear that they would never have started from the current position. He talked of reaching the second phase without saying how many phases he expected there to be. Mainly because he just doesn’t know. Three? Four? Five? He’s flying blind. Just wittering on about enthusiasm and determination no longer cuts it. The situation has outgrown Boris’s capacity for being serious. He knows he faces some tough choices in the next few weeks. A cabinet battle between the hawks who reckon tens of thousands more old people dying is a price worth paying to kick-start the economy and the doves who put the nation’s health as its first priority is looming. With him stuck somewhere in the middle. And Boris has never been in politics to make enemies. He’s Mr Fun Guy. All the tough decisions he has made have only ever been taken by accident. By default: the law of unintended consequences. Now he really is going to have to take the tough calls that will define his legacy. The honeymoon period of his resurrection will be over in a matter of days. Then comes judgment day. Whatever he does  he risks losing the confidence of half the cabinet and half the country. And the tricky calls will keep on coming. Over at the Brexit committee  Michael Gove had clearly taken far too many psychedelics  as he imagined the coronavirus could make a UK-EU deal far more likely. Hilary Benn  the committee chair  just looked bewildered. How can you possibly reach an outline of an agreement in two months  when no one has a clue what the global economy will be like in a year’s time? Nor can you blame a botched Brexit deal on the coronavirus without first spelling out your negotiating objectives. Something the government has so far refused to do.

27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-easing-uk-lockdown-require-tough-enforcement-rules,world, Easing UK lockdown would require tough rules  says adviser, Economist says strict measures needed to avoid pubs and shops getting too busy, Speaking to the Guardian  Eyal Winter said ministers could allow a broader resumption of activity  but only if it was accompanied by a stricter level of enforcement. Winter said the Cabinet Office was deeply concerned that some people would behave inappropriately as soon as lockdown was ended. One fear was that pubs would get very full. “People are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture ” he said. Winter  an economist at Lancaster University  is part of a team of behavioural experts who have been advising the government since April. His views have been shared with the cabinet office as ministers consider a range of options for how the UK might emerge from the coronavirus crisis. Winter said he opposed opening up the UK economy sector by sector. He has argued his blueprint would be more equitable than a gradual easing of restrictions  which could fuel resentment among those still unable to work. He said the government should follow a German-style approach  with clear dates and targets. “One of the most important things is to have a programme  to say  ‘in two weeks we will do such and such’ ” he said. “You need to make the rules crystal clear  and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.” He was sceptical that official “nudge” warnings would keep people out of bars  putting them at risk of getting the virus or unwittingly passing it to others. One solution would be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve  to two or three pints  he said. Customers would then be politely asked to go home. Landlords and shop owners should be tasked with enforcing these new rules and to monitoring customer numbers  he said. He envisaged theatres and cinemas would also reopen but sell half as many tickets as before  with gaps in seating. Prices could be raised to cover revenue shortfalls. A similar empty “middle-seat” policy was likely to be introduced on planes  he said. Travel would restart with a “low version of social distancing”. Winter was dismissive of Michael O’Leary  the boss of Ryanair  who last week said he wouldn’t bother flying his planes in this “idiotic” scenario. Winter pointed to the recent collapse in the global oil price. Restrictions “wouldn’t be for eternity”  he stressed. Some changes  such as the use of Zoom and other homeworking technologies  were good  he said. Overall  Winter said he was confident the world would eventually return to its pre-virus state. This would probably take two years  assuming the planet avoided future pandemics. “Some people have an apocalyptic view of this. I’m old enough to remember 9/11. We had exactly the same impression afterwards then. We thought: ‘It’s over. We will lock ourselves in shelters. We will stop flying.’ It never happened ” he pointed out. He added: “It will take a lot of time to move back to January 2020. But we will get there.” Winter – who is also a professor at the Hebrew University’s centre for the study of rationality – was speaking from his home between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He has also been advising the government in Israel  where the death toll from coronavirus has been significantly lower than in the UK. He is due to hold further discussions on Tuesday with the Cabinet Office’s behavioural science group. The group feeds policy ideas to government. Not all are accepted  Winter said. Another prominent adviser to the Cabinet Office is Daniel Kahneman  the Israeli-American economist and Nobel laureate  celebrated for his work on the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman declined to comment. Winter said that the group had discussed the gruelling psychological toll that lockdown was having on individuals. Some were “taking more risks”. Others were experiencing high levels of anxiety  which left them open to being scammed or to going on irrational spending sprees. He predicted that crime and violence were likely to jump once the lockdown was over. He also anticipated a period of social division  with grievances among those who felt they had suffered more than others. Branding some workers essential and others superfluous was unwise. This could leave citizens feeling they had been treated unfairly  he said. The Cabinet Office confirmed its team had spoken to Winter about exit lockdown strategy. It said the government sought advice from a wide range of experts including academics  healthcare professionals and business leaders. Boris Johnson has been reluctant to explain his thinking on how the lockdown might end. This is causing frustration among some Tory MPs  as well as to millions of workers who have seen their incomes evaporate. The UK’s position is increasingly anomalous: other European countries have revealed timetables for the reopening of schools and non-essential businesses. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9693ba08caedd42d50cd7ffc56b78d8fe53cbd2b/0_0_5349_3210/master/5349.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76d38d7d54d6f7bb5c52d5a5d6b28e37 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPublic+services+policy%2CPolitics%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/czech-republic-shops-reopen-as-part-of-gradual-coronavirus-lockdown-exit,world, UK said to be studying Czech exit plan where shops now reopening, Country eases coronavirus measures after quick response helped it limit cases to 7 400, Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK’s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy  the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  is understood to be studying the Czech Republic’s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west  which have helped it limit cases to 7 400  with just 221 deaths. Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools  limited public gatherings  banned all public events  sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public. Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions  initially by allowing citizens to cycle  jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks  as long as they stayed 2 metres apart. Some sports facilities  such as tennis courts and golf courses  were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together  and selected non-essential shops – including cycle stores  repair shops and hardware and DIY stores – also returned to business on 9 April. On 15 April the government unveiled a detailed five-step plan to reopen the broader economy  with the deputy prime minister  Karel Havlí?ek  dividing businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks. Craft shops  car dealerships and farmers’ markets were the first to reopen from 20 April  with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April  then larger shops outside malls  driving schools and fitness centres. The final stages were to happen in late May and early June  with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside  and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen  followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June  with hotels also allowed to reopen. Public amenities and meeting places  such as museums and galleries  as well as cultural venues including theatres  would be among the last facilities to reopen  while schools were to start returning from 11 May. Havlí?ek stressed that the government reserved the right to adjust its dates. As its infection curve continued to fall  however  the government last Thursday brought forward its exit plan  speeding up the process. Most venues are now to reopen two weeks earlier than initially planned  with gyms and all stores smaller than 2 500sq m outside shopping malls allowed to reopen on Monday. The five-stage plan is now a four-stage plan: outdoor restaurant and bar areas reopen from 11 May  along with hairdressers and beauty salons  with restaurants expected to resume indoor service and hotels allowed to reopen from 25 May  two weeks earlier than the previous 8 June date. The government also unexpectedly announced it would open its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister  Adam Vojt?ch  said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine. Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June  but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country  with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather  compared with a previous limit of two. The full breakdown of the country’s lockdown exit plan is as follows: Already open (since 20 April): 27 April: 11 May: 25 May: , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5ea27fe3e9f7b80a4e35b39da080bb8086bff6/0_212_5209_3126/master/5209.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=adb4276c476fc780acd9ce5d31b36322 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Czech+Republic%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CEurope%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/uk-to-name-scientific-advisers-on-emergency-coronavirus-group-sage,world, UK to name scientists on coronavirus advisory group Sage, Makeup of group to be made public after political advisers revealed to be in attendance, The UK government’s chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  made the announcement on Monday  shortly before Scotland’s first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  said there had been a “deficiency” in the system providing scientific advice. Sturgeon said she had been unhappy since the start of the coronavirus crisis that the chief scientist for the Scottish government did not have full participation rights in Sage meetings. Vallance said membership of Sage and the subcommittees that fed into it would be published shortly  although individual members could ask to remain anonymous. The Guardian understands scientific advisers were emailed over the weekend and given the chance to “opt out” of being named in public. The makeup of the largely secretive advisory group has come under intense scrutiny amid concerns that ministers have fumbled critical aspects of Britain’s pandemic response while insisting that they are following “the best science”. Last week  the Guardian revealed that the prime minister’s chief political adviser  Dominic Cummings  and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit  have been participating in Sage meetings. Downing Street has played down their involvement  saying they are largely silent observers. However  others on Sage have said they were shocked  concerned and worried about the impartiality of advice when they discovered No 10 political advisers would be taking part. Vallance told journalists on Monday he was strongly advised to keep the Sage membership secret to ensure the independence and personal security of the scientists on the group. The membership of Sage differs for each emergency and has varied from meeting to meeting during the coronavirus outbreak. Historically  the names of the advisers had been published after a crisis had ended  he said  adding it was unclear when that point would be reached in dealing with the coronavirus. “I believe we should be more prepared to publish names sooner  and intend to do so shortly ” he said. “We will be publishing the names of those that are happy to have their names published.” The number of named advisers is expected to reach 100 individuals. Twenty or so sit on Sage  with the rest participating in formal sub-groups or ad hoc teams set up to investigate particular issues. The sub-groups include 45 people on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) and 18 on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (Spi-B). Others come from the Covid-19 clinical information network and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). Vallance said Sage had met 28 times since its first meeting on 22 January  with early meetings flagging the need to increase testing and the potential for the virus to spread through hospitals and care homes. Vallance said there was interest in the Sage meetings across Whitehall from early on. Many people were listening in from “various departments”  but they were not part of the general discussion. “That does include people from No 10 and  yes  occasionally they ask questions.” Political advisers from Downing Street have never attended Sage meetings before  according to a review of all publicly available minutes of meetings over the last decade. Sir David King  a former chief scientific adviser  said he would not have allowed political advisers to attend his advisory meetings. “Dominic Cummings has the ear of the prime minister  so who is informing the prime minister about scientific advice?” he asked. “Is it Cummings or is it the chief scientific adviser? Suddenly you get a confusion. There must be a single voice taking the view of the scientific community to the prime minister  that is the most important thing.” Vallance said he had “no way of knowing” whether Cummings was sharing his own interpretations of Sage discussions with Johnson. “All I’m worried about is that the prime minister hears Sage advice from me. I can’t tell who else he is hearing scientific advice from.” At a briefing in Edinburgh  Sturgeon said the exclusion of scientists from the devolved administrations from Sage had prompted her to set up her own panel of advisers. The Scottish  Welsh and Northern Irish governments do not have full membership of Sage. Sturgeon said she felt some time ago this policy meant she was unable to directly question or test the scientific and technical advice being presented  undermining her ability to find the right policies for Scotland. That situation improved  she said  when she appointed Prof Andrew Morris  a Sage member and a medical data scientist at the University of Edinburgh  to lead a Scottish science advisory group that reports directly to her. Morris is also the part-time chief scientific adviser to the Scottish government’s health department. “We now have a situation where the chair of the advisory group here in Scotland does participate fully in Sage  and that has helped to  I think  deal with a deficiency that I certainly felt was there at the outset ” Sturgeon said during her daily coronavirus briefing. She said the new advisory group allowed her to “augment” the high quality and “very helpful” advice from Sage. Sturgeon said she had to have the “ability as first minister  as the chief decision-maker in the Scottish government  to interrogate directly some of that advice and to have somebody that I could ask questions of  so that my understanding of it is as it needs to be  and that wasn’t  I felt  the case earlier on with Sage.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b81f883a9ab220bcb08628d0bd505521aed0f4b/0_4_2666_1599/master/2666.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dc94d72c21b68aebe1f33598f31e4f33 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CConservatives%2CDominic+Cummings%2CPatrick+Vallance%2CNicola+Sturgeon%2CScottish+politics%2CPolitics%2CScotland%2CScience%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/public-to-submit-questions-for-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-press-conference,world, Public to get question at daily UK coronavirus press conference, No 10 says move not attempt to replace journalists despite worsening relationship, The decision comes amid speculation that the government is preparing to drop its “Stay at home  save lives  protect the NHS” slogan with analysis suggesting it is being used less in the daily press conferences. Members of the public are now being invited to submit their question on the government’s website  with the polling company YouGov employed to select one issue to be put to ministers every day. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  said on Monday the government had received 15 000 questions from the public in the first seven hours. Downing Street says the politicians and experts at the press conference will not have advance sight of the daily question from a member of the public  in line with the practice for journalists from mainstream news outlets. If an individual has their question chosen  they will be asked if they want to record a short video of themselves asking the question. If they do not  it will be read out on their behalf at the press conference. The exact details of how YouGov will select a single question remains unclear  although there are no qualifications required beyond being over-18 and stating where in the country you live. The enormous audiences for the daily press conferences  for which more than 8 million people tune in on television alone  have also focused attention on the journalists asking the questions  with government supporters using recent polling to claim their inquiring tone is alienating audiences. A No 10 spokesperson explained the decision to give a question to a member of the public: “We know people across the UK are making significant sacrifices everyday in order to stay at home  protect the NHS  we recognise the huge disruption this is having on their lives  jobs and businesses so it’s absolutely right the public get a chance to put their questions on the virus  and the measures we put in place  directly to the government and its experts. “The government is not involved in choosing the questions. That is done by an independent polling firm.” In recent weeks  Downing Street’s relationship with the media  which had improved enormously during the early part of the crisis as No 10 realised the importance of getting a clear message out to the public  has worsened following a series of critical reports. Ministers issued lengthy rebuttals to articles in the Sunday Times and Financial Times  while also attacking the Guardian’s recent reporting on the presence of Dominic Cummings at a key scientific advisory meeting. The much-repeated slogan urging people to “Stay at home  Save Lives  Protect the NHS” is also under review ahead of a relaxation of the lockdown  according to the Sunday Telegraph. Analysis by the Guardian suggests ministers and scientific advisors have reduced their use of the mantra in government press conferences from an average of seven mentions to three since the start of April. The most mentions in one briefing was by Matt Hancock  who repeated the advice eight times on 5 April – the day Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71df1bd1df2915bfc939ecc01484a6bf11e398a0/0_86_5603_3361/master/5603.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ba3d3bf4ef07209d4f56240eb656c96 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CMatt+Hancock%2CBoris+Johnson https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-tests-result-100k-a-day-pledge-not-revealed-this-week,world, Coronavirus tests: result of 100k-a-day pledge will not be revealed this week, UK government says data to be released next week on whether it hit its end-of-April target, The health secretary  Matt Hancock  made his commitment on 2 April to reach the target by the end of the month and he has said he is still on target to hit the figure despite increasing uncertainty. Figures show 29 000 tests were carried out in the latest 24-hour period of data available to the government. This does not include tests carried out over the weekend. It has emerged that the government does not expect to be able to release accurate figures on 30 April as to whether the 100 000 target had been reached. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We’re not going to be able to tell on Thursday of this week whether or not we met the 100k target. It will take a little while longer for that to be clear. “The home-testing kits  they can take up to 72 hours to get the results and therefore show up in the numbers. “It will be apparent and you will rightly be able to judge us on whether we’ve met that target but I don’t think that will be possible  certainly not on Thursday and I think it will be difficult on Friday as well. “We are working very hard to increase capacity. We’re trying our best to get as many people tested as possible.” On Monday  10 000 home-testing kits were ordered from the government’s website within an hour and 18 000 people had booked slots at other testing sites. Of the 53 892 a day testing capacity in the country  17 939 tests were carried out by the NHS  Public Health England and laboratories in Scotland and Wales  and 11 119 at drive-through sites as of 9am on Friday 25 April. Updated figures on the number of deaths in care homes from earlier in the month will be released on Tuesday. Hancock told Monday’s daily press conference that the UK’s capacity for testing was now higher than South Korea  which used a test and trace strategy to flatten the curve and did not opt for a lockdown. “It’s important to note that we’ve already gone past the number of tests per day that they carry out in South Korea. We’re approaching the levels Germany undertakes ” he said. The government has been repeatedly criticised for not rolling out mass testing much earlier on in the pandemic. South Korea can test around 20 000 people a day and Germany can test up to 800 000 a week  though typically it has tested 450 000 per week. Hancock’s comment that the UK is approaching German levels of testing will only be borne out if they hit his 100k-a-day target  and it is sustained over a week. When it came to details of where Britain is in terms of leaving the “phase one” coronavirus strategy and if it is close to reaching any of the self-imposed five tests to get out of lockdown  the PM’s spokesperson said there would be information in the coming days. However  he confirmed the country was moving “through the peak” of the virus’s spread. Boris Johnson said outside Downing Street that he would share information with the public in the next few days. The chancellor  Rishi Sunak  is also due to discuss specific loans for businesses under threat because of coronavirus in a statement to the Commons later on Monday. For the first time  a member of the public will be able to ask a question at the daily press conference alongside journalists. Questions will be submitted to the Gov.uk/ask website and then pre-selected by the polling firm YouGov  which is overseeing the process. There are no plans to reduce the number of media questions. Johnson’s offer – mentioned in his speech – of involving opposition party members in the coronavirus response will not involve a formal political alliance or jobs for opposition politicians  but regular conversations with opposition MPs will continue. His spokesperson also ruled out a government of national unity. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec1cccd6f386414bba4fc960600902d4388ea05/0_162_5177_3106/master/5177.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20fdfdee14f2ae28dfc4061ee2ea0758 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CMatt+Hancock%2CBoris+Johnson%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/care-homes-now-uks-coronavirus-frontline-sector-leaders-say,society, Care homes now UK's coronavirus frontline  sector leaders say, Operators say PM’s claim the virus has been ‘wrestled to the floor’ is premature, Deaths in some of the largest care home networks have surged by more than 70% in the last week or two  operators said on Monday. Official figures due on Tuesday are expected to show a significant increase. In the week ending 19 April  651 of the 682 coronavirus outbreaks reported across the whole of England were in care homes  Public Health England (PHE) reported. Leaders in the sector have demanded greater medical help and said the peak of social care fatalities is yet to come. Care UK reported 244 Covid-19 deaths in its facilities  a 74% rise in six days  including 18 deaths in a single home in north London where a care worker also died. Four Seasons Health Care reported a 79% increase in deaths in two weeks  bringing its death toll to 286  while the UK’s largest private provider  HC One  announced a 50% increase in deaths in 10 days  to 616. Bupa  which operates 125 homes  revealed it had lost well over 200 residents with confirmed or suspected coronavirus. The figures contrasted with the prime minister’s Downing Street speech on his first day back at work in which he declared: “We are now beginning to turn the tide.” Johnson highlighted “fewer hospital admissions  fewer Covid patients in ICU  and real signs now that we are passing through the peak”. He added: “If this virus were a physical assailant – an unexpected and invisible mugger  which I can tell you from personal experience it is – then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor.” Vic Rayner  the director of the National Care Forum  which represents charitable care home operators  said: “We are nowhere near a peak in care homes and this is absolutely the wrong time to turn away from actions to fight the virus. “This isn’t a one-round fight. We need to make sure the care sector gets the resources it needs  and we haven’t yet seen the level of action we need to get this right. The frontline of this virus has moved into care homes and the clinical focus now needs to shift.” Jeremy Richardson  the chief executive of Four Seasons  said: “We’re on the plateau rather than wrestling anything to the floor.” The number of deaths across all care homes has been hard to pin down. Last week the Department of Health and Social Care said the official death toll in care homes in England had doubled in five days  to more than 2 000 by 15 April. Figures for that period will be confirmed by the Office of National Statistics on Tuesday alongside the release of Care Quality Commission data. The current official estimates  which are equivalent to 10% of the deaths in NHS hospitals  appear to be out of line with the figures given by operators. The operators of 1 128 homes – 5% of the UK’s total – have reported more than 1 800 deaths to the Guardian. Julie Ogley  the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services  said she believes that as many people could die from the virus in social care as in hospitals  where the death toll passed 21 000 on Monday. She said supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) remained inadequate  with a promised national ordering system still not operating and not expected for several weeks. “I am very anxious that as we begin to talk about parts of the hospitals going back to [normal operation]  we still need to protect social care ” she said. “We must not be distracted. There needs to be a concerted effort to make sure those living in care homes are secure. If we don’t get that sorted out  we will end up with another wave of the virus and that will be much more difficult to deal with.” Andrew Knight  chief executive of Care UK’s residential care services  said: “Last week was the most difficult week we have faced to date. Over the last few weeks our homes have been caring for a significant number of residents who were symptomatic  and very sadly many have not made it through the illness.” Three-quarters of the chain’s 122 care homes are dealing with infections. Sonya Kaygan  a carer at Elizabeth Lodge in Enfield  died along with 18 of the residents she helped to look after. Six other homes in London have recorded more than 10 deaths each  and 15 residents died at Stanley Park  a care home in County Durham. Knight said testing “on a meaningful scale” was essential to curbing rising fatalities elsewhere. “This has been very limited to date and we need to see this scaled up significantly ” he said. “This is not just about those who are symptomatic getting back to work quickly and safely  it is also about proactive testing for those who are caring for residents to provide them with additional reassurance and ensure we aren’t inadvertently bringing the virus into the home.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Social care staff are on the frontline of our fight against coronavirus and we are making sure the social care system  and other public services  have all the resources they need during the Covid-19 outbreak. “We have given an extra £1.6bn to local authorities to address the additional pressures  rolled out testing for all social care staff  and are working day and night to deliver PPE – including setting up a dedicated phone line for care homes to report any shortages.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d391a664b1f2a087310fd386a5cbb31ae0c27583/0_80_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=601f08de1477650cd954c95a4993ea05 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Social+care%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/essex-gp-78-among-latest-nhs-workers-to-die-from-coronavirus,society, Essex GP  78  among latest NHS workers to die from coronavirus, Kamlesh Kumar Masson described as ‘honest  kind and generous man’, Kamlesh Kumar Masson  78  was a locum GP who founded Milton Road surgery in Grays  Essex  in 1985 and worked there until 2017  after which he did locum work across Thurrock and Basildon. His family  who described him as someone who “would have wanted to practise medicine for many more years to come”  said he last worked on 12 March  adding that his career “came to an unexpected end last month  when he unfortunately contracted Covid-19”. Masson is the seventh GP in the UK  and the fourth from Essex  to die from coronavirus. His family said he was “an honest  kind and generous man who was deeply respected by anyone who was privileged to cross paths with him. He was jovial  funny and kind  always wanting to make the best of any situation.” He was well known locally and recognised as a “dedicated  determined  positive individual who would always do his utmost to help in all endeavours”  they said. Masson completed his medical training in India and also worked as a doctor in east Africa. He worked in different parts of the UK before settling in Essex in 1975. Dr Anil Kallil  a fellow GP and the chairman of NHS Thurrock clinical commissioning group (CCG)  said: “We were very sad to hear of the passing of Dr Masson. He was a well-respected and liked GP in Thurrock  with a significant contribution over the last 30 years in the borough caring for patients and providing support. “Later he provided GP services in both Thurrock and Basildon. We extend our heartfelt thanks to Dr Masson for his commitment and passion and our condolences to his family for their loss.” Another NHS worker  Laura Tanner  51  who worked as a locality administrator in Essex  died in the arms of her husband  Kevin  as she waited for paramedics. Kevin Tanner said his wife was “a lovely person  kind and she loved nature. She had a wicked sense of humour and was a very  very good mother to her children and a fantastic wife. She is going to be sorely missed by everyone.” He said: “She was a locality administrator for NHS Basildon & Brentwood CCG – she was the administration side of the NHS. She put together care home packages in local area and stuff like that.” He said his wife started feeling unwell around 17 March  on his birthday. The couple both developed symptoms but his wife’s got worse and they called a paramedic  who helped lower her temperature. About six days later  her condition worsened and she developed a severe shortness of breath. “She never went into hospital – she died in my arms at home … It was horrific for me … watching my wife come down that morning panicking and so out of breath. I was making calls  not sure what to do … She just passed [away] and slipped like that ” he said. “At times [throughout her illness] I thought she was getting better. I was looking after her and making sure she was getting food and paracetamol. Sometimes she would feel better and then get upstairs and then she would be worse.” Tanner attempted CPR with the help of paramedics on the phone  who then took over and treated her on arrival. He added that he was surprised that after his wife’s death none of the family were tested. “We were just told to isolate for 14 days and let them know if we had symptoms. We did not know what to do and had to make phone calls asking: where do we stand?” Larni Zuniga  53  a nurse at CHD Living’s Surrey Hills care home  has also died. The medic  originally from the Philippines  was granted British citizenship in February. He contracted the infection two weeks ago. Zuniga  54  was treated in intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in London at the same time as the prime minister. His friend Arnold Barrientos said: “Larni had absolutely sacrificed a lot for his family. He worked hard and he battled hard times of not seeing his family just to ensure a comfortable life for them.” Mahadaye Jagroop  described as a respected and loved nurse  died at Birmingham’s Heartlands hospital  where she worked  on 22 April. Lisa Stalley-Green  the chief nurse at University hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust  said: “It was with great sadness that we learned of the death of one of our highly valued colleagues  Mahadaye Jagroop. “Mary was a respected and loved member of our team and touched the lives of many in her distinguished career as a nurse. This was demonstrated by the beautiful and heartfelt tribute by colleagues at Heartlands hospital this morning. “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Mary’s family  friends and colleagues at this sad time.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a672425ff3a31d39c24bfb56d14e546f962a200/0_371_1020_612/master/1020.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fe04c6c57f8159ee3c1185625f2581f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f17470c8a289672378bd55fd7c06de88c5900c/46_0_341_426/master/341.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e7e42a78f14f9009642a42f11e3506d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CGPs%2CUK+news%2CSociety%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CMatt+Hancock https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/27/new-trends-fashion-covers-reflect-the-era-of-coronavirus,fashion, New trends: fashion covers reflect the era of coronavirus, Physical distancing and editors’ attempts to strike right tone are set to transform glossy magazines, The logistics of physical distancing and a zeitgeist paralysed by the pandemic are combining to turn fashion upside down. Glossy magazines are scrambling to figure out what faces should be on the covers of the magazines that will hit stands during the crisis – and how to generate new imagery while travel and physical contact is curtailed under lockdown. The celebrity on the cover of the July issue of Harper’s Bazaar has been shot “by someone isolating in a remote location with the celebrity we had already booked”  said the magazine’s fashion director  Avril Mair. With no fashion editor allowed to visit  clothes were sent direct to the subject at home and styling guided by the magazine team over Zoom. A fashion story in the same issue was shot by the photographer Erik Madigan Heck at home with his wife  Brianna Killion  as model  without styling  hair or makeup. The theme of the issue is “that great creativity can come out of times of great crisis”  said Mair. “Everything is different”  said Albert Read  managing director of Conde Nast Britain. “We’ll see that in the upcoming issues: the editorial production  a tonality and vision that is appropriate to the time.” Its leading title  British Vogue  will focus on supporting healthcare workers in upcoming issues. Vogue’s stance was reflected in its decision to cancel an interview for the August issue with the singer M.I.A. in light of her anti-vaccination stance. Last week  the singer posted a screengrab of a message from the magazine which reads: “Considering our August is an issue where we’re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while a vaccine is tried to be made we don’t feel we can have her involved. It just wouldn’t be right. All of our issues July-September will be supporting the frontline heathcare workers and we need to be respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists.’’ Grazia was quick to transpose into a different key as the crisis unfolded. “I’ve always believed that you should be able to look at a Grazia cover and it be obvious what week it hit newsstands ” said the editor  Hattie Brett. “The first week of working from home  it was clear we should focus on NHS workers – so we ripped up all our pre-existing plans and shot four medics for the cover.” Earlier this month  Elle ran a digital portfolio of portraits of women doing essential work in supermarkets  on trains  and in schools and homeless shelters. “The smart editors will make magazines that reflect this moment ” said Jefferson Hack of Dazed Media. “Fashion with a capital F is on pause right now.” But magazines that have traditionally served their readers escapism and glamour are struggling with how to balance this historic role with the need not to appear out of step with the times. Tonal challenges are compounded by the logistical issues of producing imagery under social distancing rules. Imran Amed  editor-in-chief of the Business of Fashion  said “editorial and advertising shoots have come to a virtual standstill”. Carol Hayes  who helms an established agency for makeup artists and hairdressers  reports business having “ground to an almost immediate halt”. The June/July cover of American Vogue is an Irving Penn close up of a rose  the magazine’s first still-life cover in 50 years. Other workaround strategies include models putting selfie skills honed on Instagram to good use by shooting self-portraits  often on smartphones  and photographers who co-habit with a spouse  partner or adult child model offering ready made at-home creative teams. “The few shoots we are doing at the moment are like none I’ve ever worked on ” said Brett. A recent cover shoot with the British TV presenter Laura Jackson was fortuitously made possible because Jackson’s husband  Jon Gorrigan  is a photographer. Zara’s latest campaign features self-portraits by models including Malgosia Bela wearing clothes delivered directly to them at home. Domestic in setting and lo-fi in execution  the resulting images may capture something of the spirit of the moment. Johnnie Boden is currently sourcing photographer and model couples to showcase the Boden summer range with the duos managing styling  and hair and makeup. and “the photographs reflect the current climate - out of necessity  more than anything.” Clare Hornby of the Me+Em womenswear label has enlisted her teenage daughters to model. “The idea came to me as I was trying to juggle work and kids. The sun was out  so I asked them to go and create content.” Fashion photoshoots are “a hands-on business”  said the photographic agent Anita Grossman. “A stylist will want to adjust the clothes to make them look right.” Makeup artists and hairdressers are in the eye of the industry’s economic storm right now  but short term logistics look likely to impact on many. The film-set scale fashion photoshoot – fully staffed with a team including catering  set design  runners and assistants – may never return. “This is going to be a financial issue as well as a cultural and a logistical one ” said Amed. “Analysts are talking about a 30-40% drop in advertising revenue  and that may be the real long-term driver in slimming down the scale of the shoots. Even if the physical constraints are lifted  the financial ones will be there.” The Harper’s Bazaar celebrity cover for July  shot in isolation  has “a beautiful intimacy which you don’t generally achieve with a big team on set”  said Mair. “High-production shoots are going to look old-fashioned  after this ” predicted Hack. “People will want the dream again  but it will be about poetry  not artifice.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/05/20/Jess_Cartner-Morley,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83e14d6ea08e266b435fb3b9114f1828 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4703cbc17bc3671f462a054b7410a88dbc45a6/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=810487e03452f42d6a47b132c3eda996 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Fashion%2CPhotography%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2CLife+and+style%2CVogue%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown,society, UK betting firms to stop advertising on TV and radio during lockdown, MP says block on all advertising should have been in place from day one to protect addicts, The Betting and Gaming Council  which represents 90% of the UK’s betting  gaming  bingo and casino companies  said booked TV and radio slots would either feature safe gambling messaging from charities or be removed entirely if contracts with broadcasters permitted. “From day one of this crisis we have sought to protect customers potentially at risk ” said Michael Dugher  the BGC’s chief executive. “This latest move by the regulated industry further underlines our commitment to safer betting and gaming with many people cut off and feeling anxious.” Members have until 7 May to remove their ads from TV and radio  and the ban will last until at least 5 June. However  companies will continue to use other marketing channels such as direct marketing  which includes ads on social media as well as by email and text messages. This month more than 20 MPs called for strict curbs on gambling during the lockdown  including a moratorium on advertising  and called the betting industry’s own proposals “very weak”. Carolyn Harris  chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling-related harm  said a block on all advertising should have been implemented from the first day of the lockdown to protect vulnerable people and addicts stuck at home. “This is a clear admission that gambling advertising is having a profound effect on the level of problem gambling we are seeing across the UK ” she said. “I welcome today’s decision but I wish it could have been made on day one of the lockdown  rather than six weeks down the line. The damage already done is hard to comprehend. It’s vital that this is extended to all gambling advertising on all mediums throughout this pandemic.” Dugher said there had not been any explosion in online gambling as had been feared  and overall gambling was down with no live sport on TV and high-street betting shops and casinos closed. “There will always be alarmist noises from anti-gambling prohibitionists who just want to grab headlines ” he said. “We are determined to do everything we can to protect customers potentially at risk during this lockdown period and beyond.” The BGC said its members accounted for about half of all gambling advertising on TV and radio  and it called on others in the sector – including the National Lottery operator Camelot – to also implement bans. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4579391a7e2cbccfe339c7d8718a14461a8ee3/0_160_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5091f1fcd8a0228b94d2f97fda2c9591 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Gambling%2CSociety%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/clergy-tax-haven-coronavirus-richard-branson,business, Sunak rejects church leaders' call to bar tax-haven firms from bailouts, Letter signed by ex-archbishop said some large corporations ‘continue to avoid responsibility’, Senior members of the clergy including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that while vulnerable people were “paying the price” of an underfunded and unprepared NHS  “some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility  making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens”. They urged the UK government to follow the lead of Denmark  Poland and France in refusing to provide state support to companies registered in tax havens. Rishi Sunak  the chancellor  was challenged in the House of Commons on Monday by the Labour MP Peter Kyle about what the government planned to do about companies that had “so aggressively avoided paying tax in this country”. “Many of those same companies are now relying on the largesse and generosity of taxpayers in order to remain solvent in these difficult times ” said Kyle  who sits on the business  energy and industrial strategy committee. “As the chancellor starts to plan for the recovery economy  will he take this opportunity to have conversations with those companies to make sure that when we do recover they play a much fuller part in our economy going forward? Let’s aim for not business as normal when we get back from this crisis  let’s aim for business as better.” Sunak said it was important that businesses act responsibly  but he did not set out any plans to bar tax-avoiding firms from state bailouts or the furlough scheme. “We are all in this together ” he said. “It is right that during this process people act responsibly  and that is something I have urged all businesses to do.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “The aim of all our schemes is to support individuals and companies in the UK  and that is what they are doing  with millions benefiting from our grants  loans and the furloughing scheme. “HMRC has robust tools to challenge businesses who avoid paying their fair share of tax. That is the right way to challenge avoidance  not by denying support to British workers who pay their taxes and would otherwise lose their jobs.” A tax-haven-based pub and restaurant chain has taken advantage of the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme to furlough 16 500 staff. Stonegate  which is registered at PO Box 2681  Cricket Square  Grand Cayman  Cayman Islands  owns the chains Slug & Lettuce  Yates and Walkabout. A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: “Stonegate is a UK business  located in Luton  which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax  employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over £300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business  fully paying UK tax  we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.” The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times: “During this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile  some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility  making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. “More than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [£6.4tn] sits offshore  with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.” The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson  president of the Methodist Conference  the Rev David Mayne  moderator of the Baptist Union Council  and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. John McDonnell  the former shadow chancellor  said: “We can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.” France’s finance minister  Bruno Le Maire  has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country’s €110bn (£96bn) rescue package. “If your head office is located in a tax haven  it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support ” he said. Rune Lund  a Danish MP and Denmark’s parliamentary tax spokesman  said: “When we spend billions of taxpayers’ money on saving companies and jobs  they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.” Sir Richard Branson’s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline £500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK’s seventh richest person  with an estimated £4.7bn fortune. The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson  who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK  but Branson’s personal holding company  Virgin Group Holdings Ltd  is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c79ab95eca700bb39b8d6f89eabce56a28df360/0_65_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dbd07815a536aa760f82f57fe7cbf133 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925c163614ccb041600b87240c674d0e8c1411c5/0_157_4056_2434/master/4056.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8daf1b4092ba231feff4621be1cee784 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a0303d4126defb9e6d08278276f3868a43d008/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d89e0d1be6c09fefb078e7e6be77a3f8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f7f7353ff2d422b92149792cf43b1f134eef2e/0_69_4518_2711/master/4518.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=904186ce1f2932c52a5094a50ddde895 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4240df5f2e3351beb35ee361ce55a165af7685c2/0_176_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94769dfc0ba745921088d5ec032f551f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Tax+avoidance%2CBusiness%2CRowan+Williams%2CUK+news%2CAnglicanism%2CChristianity%2CReligion https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus,world, Ardern: New Zealand has 'won battle' against community transmission of Covid-19, Ahead of move to level-3 lockdown  PM says country must remain vigilant, Ardern said New Zealand had “avoided the worst” in the pandemic  but must continue to fight the virus. “There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way ” she said. At 11.59pm on Monday  New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. During that time  almost all businesses have been closed  along with schools while the population has been asked to remain in their homes for all but supermarket visits and short walks. Ardern said there was no way of knowing what may have happened without the level-4 lockdown. But she warned that in level-3 there were new risks – namely people coming into more contact with others. Level 3 will see retailers  restaurants and schools allowed to reopen on a smaller scale. Schools will reopen on Wednesday for children up to Year 10 who cannot study from home  or whose parents need to return to work. Workers will also be able to resume on-site work  provided they have a Covid-19 control plan in place  with appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures. It is expected one million New Zealanders will return to work on Tuesday. However  Ardern warned the public of bringing too many people into expanded family “bubbles”. “We are opening up the economy  but we’re not opening up people’s social lives ” Ardern said. The director general of health  Ashley Bloomfield  said that the transmission of the virus had been “eliminated”. This did not mean zero cases  but that health officials knew where all new cases were coming from. Ardern was also optimistic – asked if New Zealand had eliminated Covid-19  she replied “currently”. New Zealand’s transmission rate – the number of people each infected person can pass the virus to – was now under 0.4  compared to the average overseas transmission rate of 2.5. Bloomfield said Covid-19 was a “tricky virus” and New Zealanders needed to remain vigilant. He reported one more Covid-19 related death on Monday. The nation’s 19th victim was a woman in her 90s. There was one new confirmed case and four probably cases  he said. Ardern said the country would remain at level 3 for two weeks before cabinet decided on whether to move to level 2. “We can only do this if we continue to pull together. If we need to stay at level 3 [for longer] we will.” She also said she was hopeful that New Zealand and Australia might be able to create a trans-Tasman bubble at some time in the future  possibly allowing travel between the two countries  but the focus was making sure both countries were domestically managing the virus. Despite the optimistic numbers  both Bloomfield and Ardern warned against complacency. “To succeed we must hunt down the last few cases of the virus ” said Ardern. “This is like looking for a needle in a haystack.” To that end  a contact tracing app for Covid-19 would also be available in the next fortnight  however  Ardern said that had limitations. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0713e6057fc514330c62b49c24393210dd4707c/0_171_5076_3047/master/5076.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc54aeb3dc53d322f4aed63e23d3c90e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=New+Zealand%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/european-leaders-face-pressure-move-faster-easing-lockdowns-germany,world, European leaders face pressure to move faster on easing lockdowns, As some nations relax rules  others such as Germany are arguing about how far to go, But  in other European countries  leaders are coming under growing pressure to move faster and Germany was locked in a row over how and when to lift restrictions amid concerns the country is in danger of gambling away its achievements so far. Over 3 million people have been infected by the coronavirus around the world and more than 208 000 have died  according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The world’s worst pandemic in a century has forced governments into a dilemma. People confined to their homes for weeks are growing frustrated and anxious and  with economic activity all but dead  prolonged recessions are forecast in many countries. But with an antidote or vaccine yet to be found  leaders are also acutely aware of the danger of a second wave of infections. The Swiss stopped short of full lockdown in emergency measures introduced last month  but on Monday began the first of a three-stage lifting plan with doctors  dentists  nursery schools  hairdressers and massage and beauty salons permitted to reopen along with hardware stores  garden centres and florists. A week after it reopened its pre-schools  Norway sent its younger primary school pupils back to class – with a maximum of 15 in each  and many parents far from reassured – after a month and a half of remote learning from home. In the Czech Republic  which declared a state of emergency before its first Covid-19 death  a five-stage lockdown exit plan has been moved forward  allowing gyms and stores smaller than 2 500 sq metres outside shopping malls to reopen on Monday. The central European country’s detailed roadmap  which divides businesses and amenities into five – since reduced to four – categories according to the risk of new infections each poses  is understood to be being studied by the UK government. Croatia on Monday also began easing curbs  allowing smaller shops  libraries and museums to reopen  while Serbia permitted small businesses and food markets to open their shutters  eased an overnight curfew and allowed elderly people to venture outside three times a week. Romania said it would not extend the current state of emergency past 15 May  when people will be able to move around with documentation. Governments in other countries  however  are facing a more problematic path out of lockdown. Germany has so far limited its outbreak to fewer than 160 000 cases and just over 6 000 deaths  a far lower proportion than many countries. But having slowed the virus’s spread  many people believe its dangers have been exaggerated and the country should get back to work. Wolfgang Schäuble  an elder statesman and current president of the Bundestag lower house  said the social and economic costs of lockdown should be weighed against the need to save lives. “When I hear that protecting lives should come above everything else  I don’t think that is absolutely true ” Schäuble told Der Tagesspiegel. “The massive economic  social  psychological and other effects need to be weighed up ” he said. “To just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences.” The chancellor  Angela Merkel  warned last week that some of the country’s 16 states were moving too fast to ease physical distancing measures. Her words were echoed on Monday by the economy minister  Peter Altmaier. “As a person who believes in fact-based decisions  I recommend to all of us to proceed very carefully in order not to be forced into eventually rescinding these decisions to ease restrictions ” Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio. But although almost three-quarters of the German population said they supported the lockdown measures in a poll published on Friday and the popularity of Merkel’s government has leapt 10 points  frustration – and opposition – is beginning to mount. Armin Laschet  the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia and a candidate to succeed Merkel as leader of their Christian Democratic Union party  said the question was “of course still one of life and death”. But he also insisted the negative effects of lockdown should be weighed up and noted that “40% of intensive care beds are empty” in his state. Germany’s most popular newspaper  Bild  on Monday accused Merkel of being “stubborn  pig-headed and bossy”  while the Green party has urged her to be even more cautious  and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said an absolute shutdown was avoidable and people “must be given back their liberty”. In France  pressure on the president  Emmanuel Macron  is also increasing as his prime minister  Édouard Philippe  prepared to present on Tuesday long-awaited details of the country’s plan to emerge from lockdown from 11 May. A survey published at the weekend showed less than half the population – 43% – still supported maintaining strict lockdown measures  down eight points from the previous week. Meanwhile  opposition MPs are angry they will have only hours to debate the plan before a vote on Tuesday afternoon. France also plans to have more than 26m non-medical face masks available for purchase by the end of this week  the deputy finance minister  Agnes-Pannier Runacher  said on Monday. Spain’s nearly 47 million people have spent more than six weeks under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world  with only adults authorised to leave home to buy food and medicines or walk the dog. Authorities cautiously prepared further steps to loosen confinement on Monday after children were allowed to leave their homes for the first time in six weeks on Sunday  causing concern about crowds in some areas. Italy  which has the world’s third highest rate of coronavirus deaths at more than 26 000  will allow factories and building sites to reopen from 4 May and permit limited family visits as it prepares a staged end to Europe’s longest lockdown  the prime minister  Giuseppe Conte  said at the weekend. Meanwhile  in the US  the White House cancelled its Monday press briefing on the coronavirus  following days of controversy resulting from Donald Trump’s comments about injecting disinfectant as a possible treatment for Covid-19. Trump has not attended the briefing since Friday  tweeting that the press conferences are “not worth the time & effort”. There have been reports that the White House wants to refocus the briefings on reopening the economy. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1b2c3553474d308a6fc337769830896d9f1c3de/0_52_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=599cfa84258e10279e882a2d96bf0980 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8efd2c57b3cee43a7e0521390ffc63ed99c27c5b/0_1_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74ab2dead4dde6abce3f85831bb194b0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CGermany%2CSpain%2CItaly%2CSwitzerland%2CNorway%2CCzech+Republic%2CCroatia%2CRomania%2CSerbia%2CFrance%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/24-hrs-madrid-emergency-ambulance-coronavirus-photo-essay,world, 'We have to watch people die': 24 hours with Madrid's emergency ambulance crews – photo essay, Photojournalist Pablo García Sacristán spent a day and night with Madrid’s Summa crews  offering medical - and psychological – support to coronavirus patientsby Pablo García Sacristán in Madrid, But there’s been no such thing as a normal day in the capital for well over a month. Normality has long since disappeared in the fight against Covid-19  and the city’s main arteries are unclogged by cars. This makes life easier for the 29 specialised ambulances of the regional medical emergency service (Summa)  which have traversed in and around the capital since mid-March  responding to a seemingly endless series of calls. Onboard one of the ambulances – callsign UV16 – is Dr Alonso Mateo  the assistant head of Madrid’s regional transplant coordination service. After setting up a makeshift hospital in a hotel and doing shifts at the huge field hospital at Madrid’s main convention centre  Mateo now forms part of a mobile crew. Alongside him are Marta Vivas  a nurse  and two technicians  Daniel Martínez and Miguel Collado  the latter of whom hs recently returned to work after being off for 20 days with coronavirus. “I’m not scared of it at all but I’ve got a healthy respect for it  and I want to do my bit when it comes to putting an end to this nightmare ” says Miguel. After coffee and a careful revision of their kit  the first call of the day comes in and they set off at full speed from their base in the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas. On arrival  they suit up in their personal protective equipment. All cases must be treated as potential Covid-19  so overalls go on  along with gloves and masks. They dress with practised speed and efficiency. Inside  one of the technicians remains at the door as the designated “clean man”. It is his job to help his colleagues out of their gear when they emerge and disinfect their outfits Mateo has been an intensive care unit doctor for 15 years  “but it was only during the time of Ebola that we learned to put on isolation suits – even though we always carried them in the ambulances”. Things are different now  he adds: “For any kind of urgent job we use total isolation measures – and hardcore suits – for the patient’s protection  and for our own. A very high proportion of people who have caught the disease are health workers  and we just can’t do what we’re called on to do if those numbers stay as they are.” “Getting to someone’s house and being able to help them when they’re hanging between life and death is something money just can’t buy ” says Marta. But sadly – and as Dani points out – that’s not always the case. “Sometimes we have to watch as people die and there’s nothing we can do about it ” he says. “That’s really tough and something you just have to try to learn to live with. You just have to keep it together because there’s always someone who needs your help and you need to fight to save their lives.” Mónica Coll  the doctor on ambulance UV15 gets one such call mid-afternoon. She and the nurse  Guillermo Lago  arrive to find an elderly woman with breathing problems and a fever. Everything points to Covid-19 and there’s nothing that can be done. The pair treat the woman’s sister with enormous care and kindness  and  thanks to them  she watches her sister die with an uncommon serenity. They tell her that she died without any pain or suffering  and that that is the most important thing in the circumstances. On the other side of the door  UV15’s technician  Roberto Gonzalez and Javier García  are waiting. The report needs to be filled out before their colleagues can be disinfected. Even in times such as these  older people are scared of going to hospital because it means they will be on their own. They tend to leave it to the last minute  by which time it’s often too late. They fear the loneliness and the idea of being left to face their final moments alone. They also know that most of their relatives will not be able to come to their funerals either  because coronavirus has done away with the familiar norms – like going to hospital when you feel ill; like knowing someone will be beside you when you die. And that is where the ambulance crews that tear across Madrid come in: it’s not just physical help they bring – it’s psychological support  too. Although the pace of the day is relentless things calm briefly when the team stops for dinner. They have 15 minutes for a salad and coffee before work resumes. It’s not that they are immune to fatigue  says Miguel  who can remember the tiredness he felt when he had the virus: “It’s the love and the vocation you have for this that gets the adrenaline flowing. You have to give it 100% because there are lives at stake.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05e8efbab9daf99563fb4054ef86b80c7ccdc6/0_0_4676_3333/master/4676.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ac537079828008a49b606bc2d3ff6d7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/136ad8279a70ca109f3551738302c2833467b47c/0_0_4865_3260/master/4865.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8da1443241459f0ebb59716903b9b45e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa6a41a1ba037ff8deda48b4e394ca633265d1e9/0_37_4474_2686/master/4474.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50ca1b5672b8aeb0af56c75b65240c92 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e171535dab991558042a0d756c30b978a08ae0/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bb7786ca32c119a909fe2258448ede7f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e941d89263da04f8c1a821bcc094d90b7b96f80/0_414_4573_2744/master/4573.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48d664976ea56dc49fc074347c81cc6b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e2bfa78b7f7b5126591562757951643697b83a/0_0_4840_3114/master/4840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9db698246139ca8080bdbad20ae91aea https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296ddfb1f4d769ecb1babdec53d475f2be97ac0a/0_0_5187_3612/master/5187.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d27db85d40c2a69c2d0efda89bbcda3a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05e8efbab9daf99563fb4054ef86b80c7ccdc6/0_0_4676_3333/master/4676.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ac537079828008a49b606bc2d3ff6d7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a522145dea56a44beb2a6b0d60630b1599410cbf/0_443_4925_2956/master/4925.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea3cc16de70327f7d72d7eff64f47c80 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/800327eb95f92a93cd6f7ad00127dfb5b0ecab08/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7858432f120dfb4bdc4f96a89649232 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5366002446a582b9a872b0ba6a5bdfbe1dffa872/81_11_4123_3498/master/4123.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c10033a85276b43bdc2aae3674fa4171 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ede06bb5a247ba4ac96393b68dd2ea890b2817da/1028_154_4022_3417/master/4022.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8864a87cf04b524cb60ea5f3f755adc8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f419c73d40ad595a422c86e96a32cf79292969e8/0_0_5314_3490/master/5314.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=370d1bb27f3fceaf21c182c79d46e233 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee342ffde5cabfcc586345f3edbc408ef4af124/0_48_4992_3582/master/4992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5efe3eafdbcad3132e9a9a7a324813d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Spain%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/moscow-motives-questioned-over-coronavirus-aid-shipment-to-italy,world, Moscow's motives questioned over coronavirus aid shipment to Italy, ‘From Russia with love’ package including doctors and PPE criticised as propaganda to exploit cracks in EU, Russia  which has cultivated good relations with Italy in recent years  was one of the first countries to come to the rescue during the early stages of Italy’s outbreak. It dispatched 122 military doctors  personal protective equipment (PPE)  ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow. The Nato general Tod Wolters said this month that he was chiefly concerned about the presence of Russian military staff in Italy. “It is of concern. I pay very close attention to Russian malign influence ” he said. The aid gesture  accompanied by the message “From Russia with love”  has been branded by observers as propaganda. Lorries emblazoned with both countries’ flags and the aid slogan were broadcast on Russian state TV as they made the long journey from a military base near Rome to Bergamo  the province most severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But Italy’s political leadership was dealt a series of blows over the aid. On 25 March a high-level political source told Jacopo Iacoboni  a journalist from La Stampa newspaper  that 80% of the Russian PPE was “useless”. A Russian defence spokesman attacked the story on social media  ending his message with the veiled warning to Iacoboni that “[he] who digs the grave crashes into it”. La Stampa’s story was not denied by the Italian government. In a further embarrassment  Russia’s foreign minister  Sergei Lavrov  said at a press conference that the request had come from the Italian prime minister  Giuseppe Conte  whose requests for essential aid from other EU member states had been rebuffed. Conte’s office did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the aid. Andrea Armaro  a former spokesperson at Italy’s defence ministry  said Russia was “playing to weaken Europe and Italy”. He questioned the need for Russian military medics to disinfect areas when there were already nuclear  biological and chemical military teams in Italy capable of doing the job. “And why did they land at Pratica di Mare  a very important military airport near Rome  instead of Bergamo airport or even Milan?” he said. “If these were sincere operations with nothing to hide  you would land at the closest airport. [Russia was] taking advantage of a ‘friendly’ government  as well as a sloppy and inattentive one . “It was the largest and most successful propaganda operation carried out in a Nato territory at practically zero cost. I hope someone in Washington and Brussels wakes up before it’s too late.” As Russia’s own outbreak has intensified  so too have domestic questions about aid shipments. During a conference call on Monday last week  Putin defended deliveries to Italy and the US  calling them “not just a one-way street”. Russia analysts said there were some straightforward motivations for the foreign aid campaign  including diplomatic interests and the possibility of garnering return aid at a later date. “No country does humanitarian assistance purely because of the kindness of its heart ” said Mark Galeotti  an expert on Russian politics and security  adding that Russia was interested in currying favour with the Italians and framing a new narrative about its partnership with Europe. “We’re all in this together  which obviously can be used to chip away at sanctions.” A Kremlin spokesman denied that the aid was aimed at getting EU sanctions on Russia lifted  saying there was no discussion of “conditions or hopes or expectations”. Galeotti said it was possible that military intelligence operatives would have joined the mission in Italy “out of the habitual security mindset inside of Russia”. But he said their presence would be “frankly irrelevant  because there’s nothing really secret about this effort”. An analyst with ties to the defence ministry also said it was possible that members of Russian military intelligence would have joined the trip. But the mission’s main goal  he believed  would have been gathering as much information as possible about the virus and what methods were effective in fighting it to be prepared for the coming wave of infections at home. “This was the time to gather information ” said the analyst  who asked not to be named. “Because the military knows that when the situation gets bad in Russia  Putin is going to send them to fight it here too.” The fact that Conte requested “complete aid”  which he knew would include military medics  might not bode well for Italy  particularly as it battles for financial aid from the EU. “Italy is reaching out to authoritarian powers and  ultimately  the company you keep is going to be an issue ” said Francesco Galietti  the founder of Policy Sonar  a Rome-based political consultancy. “The question has to be raised as to whether you can flirt with everyone as you please  or if there is an etiquette  because if there is an etiquette then Italy is bluntly violating it.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5afdd276c2284b0161a48299fa0d4e32f494da7/0_0_4790_2875/master/4790.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88b49263eeb25f21955d465de2f60aa3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Italy%2CRussia%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CEuropean+Union%2CGiuseppe+Conte https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/dont-judge-swedens-light-touch-on-covid-19-yet-says-minister,world, Don’t judge Sweden’s light touch on Covid-19 yet  says minister, But Ann Linde warns of tougher action after Stockholm pubs are shut for breaking rules, “There’s been a lot of misunderstanding ” Ann Linde said. “We have pretty much the same goals as every other government … And as we have always said  we are perfectly ready to go with more binding regulations if the population does not follow.” Sweden has closed senior schools and banned gatherings of more than 50  but asked – rather than ordered – people to avoid non-essential travel  work from home and stay at home if they are elderly or ill. Relying on citizens to act responsibly  it has left shops and restaurants and gyms open  but expects those visiting them to obey distancing norms. Many Swedes support and are complying with the policy  which contrasts with the strict mandatory lockdowns imposed in many EU countries and has been heavily criticised by some scientists. The country’s death toll per million  while far lower than Italy’s and Spain’s  is also many times higher than those of its Nordic neighbours. Linde told the Guardian in an interview that Sweden’s aims were to “save lives  stop the virus from spreading  ensure the healthcare system can cope and mitigate the consequences for business and jobs”. It must also be sustainable for the long term  she said: “This is a marathon  not a sprint.” Stockholm authorities shut down five pubs and restaurants that failed to observe the recommendations this weekend  only allowing customers time to finish their food before obliging them to leave. “This was a strong signal ” Linde said. “These are not voluntary measures. You are meant to follow them. We believe the best way for us is a combination of some binding regulations and clear advice to the public. As far as possible  we want to build on a strong  longstanding relationship of trust between authorities and the public.” There is plenty of evidence that most people are falling in line  she said  citing a 96% fall in reservations at the country’s two most popular domestic holiday destinations after the government repeated its advice to stay at home over the Easter break. The country’s rate of infection is also showing signs of levelling off and the Public Health Agency estimates up to 20% of the population of Stockholm has contracted the virus. Linde said she “would have been surprised if there had not been criticism” of the strategy  spearheaded by the country’s chief epidemiologist  Anders Tegnell  who has described it as being not about creating “herd immunity” but containing the spread of the virus while preserving the capacity of the health service to respond. Some of the country’s leading medical professors and academics have been fiercely critical of the decision not to follow much of the rest of Europe into strict lockdown  publishing open letters and petitions calling for an urgent change of course and highlighting a death toll which  at 2 194  is three times the per-million tally recorded in Denmark and Germany and more than six times that of Finland. Linde said Sweden’s relatively high death toll was “certainly not part of the plan” but conceded that the exceptional number of deaths in care homes  which so far account for more than half of all the country’s deaths from the coronavirus  was “one area where we have failed”. The government passed early binding legislation banning visits to care homes for elderly people  she said  “but still the virus got in and a lot of deaths have occurred. We don’t know why this is – perhaps because some homes did not observe regulations  perhaps because staff’s jobs were not secure so they felt they could not afford to take sick leave … We’re investigating.” Linde said that while cooperation between the Nordic countries had generally been excellent despite “very different views of what was effective” in tackling Covid-19  there had been “long discussions” with Denmark and Finland over the issue of border closures before arrangements were found that were acceptable to both sides. Finland in particular had to be persuaded to allow the healthcare sector workers on whom Sweden relies in some regions to continue commuting across the border every day. “I have  generally  had to answer a lot of questions from my counterparts around the world about our approach ” she said. Despite avoiding total lockdown  Sweden’s heavily export-dependent economy has been as hard hit by the pandemic as most countries. The government has launched relief measures worth about 100bn kronor (£8bn) but still expects GDP to contract by up to 10% this year. Unemployment is already surging. Linde insisted it was too early to judge the success or otherwise of her government’s decisions relative to those of others  or even to tell what the criteria for success might eventually be. “I won’t evaluate or judge the strategy in Sweden or anywhere else ” she said. “It will take rather a long time before anyone can do that.” Different countries have different methods of counting Covid-19 deaths  she pointed out. And the longer-term consequences – for example  the impact on public health of lengthy enforced lockdowns  or of widespread job losses – would take years to assess. “We have simply tried to do what we believe to be right ” she said. • This article was amended on 29 April 2020 because an earlier version said that Sweden’s “Public Health Agency estimates up to 20% of its population has contracted the virus. In fact  that figure relates to the population of Stockholm. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b53d084e76fd534ccb7a28745725537df1bbe46/0_294_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd1851244f9902c17e7ad2a57f4dd086 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a11cbbcccc821e9d7479a64ac08e41f0910e7883/0_54_4890_2934/master/4890.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e013ba766d976e5c6b88270634d53b52 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Sweden%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/germans-could-be-fined-up-to-10000-for-not-wearing-face-masks-coronavirus,world, Germans could be fined up to €10 000 as face mask rules brought in, Measure to help combat coronavirus comes into force in shops and on public transport, The so-called Maskenpflicht (mask duty) was introduced in 15 of the country’s 16 states on Monday morning. The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will on Wednesday be the last state to implement the legislation. Fines of between €25 and €10 000 can be imposed on those who fail to wear a mask  with rates differing widely across the country  and some states  such as Berlin and Brandenburg  insisting they would not levy fines at all  but would rely instead on people showing each other mutual respect by wearing them. Other states said they would allow a few days of grace for people to get used to the new rule. The heftiest fines will apply to shopkeepers whose staff are caught not wearing masks  and there are incremental fine systems in some states for repeat offenders. Authorities have been quick to insist the masks do not have to be medically approved. Scarfs or cloths over the nose or mouth are adequate. Tailors across the country  as well as bands of hobby sewers have been busy making masks to meet high demand  while there are reports of elastic shortages. Some states  such as Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern  have said they will provide masks to their citizens. But the decision has drawn scorn from some medical experts  who say non-medical masks will have little effect in stemming the spread of the virus  and could even encourage it  if masks are worn incorrectly. “Politicians have known for three months that we have this problem  and have not managed to have FFP2 masks (which filter the air and can keep viruses out) produced in Germany or to import them. That is not a problem that it can offload on to the people ” Frank Ulrich Montgomery  the chairman of the World Medical Association  told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. He said the proper wearing of a mask was complicated. “People are in danger of contaminating themselves if they wear a mask incorrectly ” he said  adding that masks can lead to a false sense of security. Decision-makers have stressed the psychological importance of wearing a face covering  saying it sends out a signal to people who might come too near. They have repeatedly insisted the wearing of masks is altruistic  with the masks protecting less the wearer than those who they are in close proximity to  by limiting the dispersion of drops if a person coughs  sneezes or spits. As Deutsche Bahn  the national rail provider  announced the restrictions on its trains  it said there was a need for European countries to reach out and agree on rules for trains travelling across the borders with Belgium and the Netherlands  which unlike other borders have not closed. But as Germans sought to understand the rules – which could radically alter social interactions by hiding facial expressions – in a confusing twist car drivers were warned not to wear coverings that completely disguised their faces or risk a €60 fine. This is largely so they can still be recognised by speed cameras and police surveillance. Since October 2017 it has been illegal for people to cover their face while driving  with veils  burqas and niqabs specifically singled out. Passengers are not affected. In most states the mask duty applies to those aged six or seven and over. People with disabilities for whom wearing a mask would be inappropriate  such as those with breathing difficulties  are exempt. Amid calls for unified rules governing the Maskenpflicht  Angela Merkel  the German chancellor – who has offered tips on keeping masks hygienic such as ironing them – has said a meeting with all the state heads on Thursday will seek to at the very least come up with a nationwide fine system. A poll by the Kantar market research institute found that acceptance for mask wearing was extremely high  with 97% of those asked saying they supported the rule and recognised the importance of keeping it to help tackle coronavirus.  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6442d1fd60576befead497d0d2eb4cc2aef55812/0_336_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e63cb39d130e7ebfa7faaacf490c1775 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CGermany%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/german-doctors-pose-naked-in-protest-at-ppe-shortages,world, German doctors pose naked in protest at PPE shortages, Group says nudity is ‘a symbol of how vulnerable we are without protection’, Calling their protest Blanke Bedenken  or Naked Qualms  members of the group said they felt at risk from coronavirus and claimed their calls for help over several months had gone unheeded. Ruben Bernau  a GP in the group  told the Ärztezeitung that he and his practice team were insufficiently equipped to deal with the virus. “The nudity is a symbol of how vulnerable we are without protection ” he said. The doctors posed in their practices  taking cover behind files  toilet rolls  medical equipment and prescription blocks. Christian Rechtenwald  who also has a GP practice  said the group had been inspired by the actions of a French doctor  Alain Colombié  who was photographed naked in his practice after describing himself and fellow doctors as “cannon fodder” in the fight against the pandemic. Jana Husemann  another GP  said: “Of course we want to continue treating patients who still need to receive a close examination.” For that she required proper PPE  she said. One doctor said she was “trained to sew up wounds” and asked: “Why am I now having to sew my own face mask?” German doctors have repeatedly appealed for more PPE since the arrival of the virus in Germany in late January. German firms that make protective clothing have upped their production capacities but have been unable to meet demand. Medical practices  clinics and care homes have made frequent requests for filter masks  goggles  gloves and aprons and say their needs have barely been met. Medical staff have also reported widespread theft of disinfectant and masks from hospitals  for which police have blamed organised criminal gangs. Many hospitals have increased their security as a result. A recent study by an association of German health insurers found that doctors were lacking more than 100m single-use masks  almost 50m filter masks  more than 60m single-use aprons  and a similar number of disposable gloves. Demand for PPE has differed strongly from region to region  with North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria among the most in need. Marc-Pierre Möll  the chief executive of the German Medical Technology Association  called on the government to support a structured increase in domestic production. “If such organisation was politically desired and there were guaranteed quantities for fair prices  there would be no difficulties ” Möll told German media. The government has responded by saying it plans to centralise the procurement of PPE. On its Twitter feed @BlankeBedenken  the protest group said Germany had claimed to be well resourced in its coronavirus fight. “But the protective clothing  disinfectant and single-use masks were soon not to be had. Despite their concerns about they and their patients being insufficiently protected against contracting the virus  across the country GPs and their teams are caring for people.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6719282d6a74eba831a0bdfe7b37bab116572561/313_454_1711_1027/master/1711.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb89bd3099e3042ad8aece9e7912d40a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c20db8fe8f6c1e173f8999c819817742b2e208/0_0_1875_2344/master/1875.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd37e5dfe77e2a409c1ea767e7191edd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/27/meteorologists-say-2020-on-course-to-be-hottest-year-since-records-began,environment, Meteorologists say 2020 on course to be hottest year since records began, Global lockdowns have lowered emissions but longer-term changes needed  say scientists, Although the coronavirus lockdown has temporarily cleared the skies  it has done nothing to cool the climate  which needs deeper  longer-term measures  the scientists say. Heat records have been broken from the Antarctic to Greenland since January  which has surprised many scientists because this is not an El Niño year  the phenomenon usually associated with high temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates there is a 75% chance that 2020 will be the hottest year since measurements began. The US agency said trends were closely tracking the current record of 2016  when temperatures soared early in the year due to an unusually intense El Niño and then came down. The US agency said there was a 99.9% likelihood that 2020 will be one of the top five years for temperatures on record. A separate calculation by Gavin Schmidt  the director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York  found a 60% chance this year will set a record. The Met Office is more cautious  estimating a 50% likelihood that 2020 will set a new record  though the UK institution says this year will extend the run of warm years since 2015  which is the hottest period on record. Abnormal weather is increasingly the norm as temperature records fall year after year  and month after month. This January was the hottest on record  leaving many Arctic nations without snow in their capital cities. In February  a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq  in Greenland  set an April record of 6C on Sunday. In the first quarter  the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia  where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks  large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday  downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C  according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat. In the UK  the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average  with records set in Cornwall  Dyfed and Gwynedd. Karsten Haustein  a climate scientist at the University of Oxford  said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data  but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated. Although the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions  he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern. “The climate crisis continues unabated ” Haustein said. “The emissions will go down this year  but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives  taxes  carbon prices etc).” This was echoed by Grahame Madge  a climate spokesman for the Met Office: “A reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc4b039941c66dea05d6b65151a98deeae58126/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac4cef7fc7a46c1e64636d4554d55d50 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Climate+change%2CMeteorology%2CEnvironment%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/prague-mayor-under-police-protection-amid-reports-russian-plot-zdenek-hrib,world, Prague mayor under police protection amid reports of Russian plot, Zdenêk H?ib says there is ‘risk to my life’ as magazine alleges he was poisoning target, Zden?k H?ib confirmed on Monday that police had placed him under protection several weeks ago after identifying a threat against him  but declined to say whether had been been targeted by Russia or reveal the nature of threat. “First of all I should say that it is very important for me to stand by my belief although it means a risk for my life ” H?ib said in an interview with Russia’s independent Echo of Moscow radio station. “The police protection was simply given to me by the Czech police. By their decision  I am not able to comment on the reasons.” H?ib added he had been under police protection for more than two weeks. Last week  Czech media reported he had been placed under “temporary police protection” and had filed a police complaint after concerns he was being followed near his home. The Guardian has reached out to H?ib for comment. On Sunday  the Czech weekly magazine Respekt reported that a person carrying Russian diplomatic papers had arrived in Prague three weeks ago with the objective of assassinating H?ib and another Czech politician  Ond?ej Kolá?. The news website  citing anonymous sources in Czech intelligence  said the would-be assassin had been carrying a suitcase containing the lethal poison ricin. Neither Czech law enforcement  nor the Czech politicians have confirmed that report. Dmitry Peskov  a spokesman for Vladimir Putin  called it “a fake”. “We don’t know anything at all about this investigation ” he said on Monday. “We don’t know who did the investigation. It looks like yet another canard.” Both politicians have been outspoken in local conflicts involving Russia. H?ib had spoken favourably about the renaming the square in front of the Russian embassy in honour of Boris Nemtsov  an opposition politician slain in sight of the Kremlin in 2015. The Russian embassy in Prague last week said it would not take an address on the square  but use the address of a street to which it is also adjacent. Kolá?  the mayor of the Prague 6 municipality  played a prominent role in efforts to take down a statue to the Soviet-era Marshal Ivan Konev  the removal of which earlier this month was met with angry protests by Russia’s embassy in Prague and in Moscow. “Konev has been toppled  but Konev will stand again – only in the museum ” Kolár said  according to local news reports after the statue was removed. Kolá? had previously been given police protection due to the conflict over the statue  which had been ongoing for years. In 2019 he said he had been forced to leave Prague after receiving threats by email  social media and text message. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f743d84d19b72ed1368091cb057b4d9cd8b1624/380_372_3343_2006/master/3343.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cb5a7f3797bbb9fb4a5274f8dbe872c7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a33b1fe7968b1da3cb15afffe22129acc5daf77/0_0_5457_3274/master/5457.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dcf2a2cd6cbac69462c4ea9b277e137c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f8f541e514c343a78bd0bba660ca965180fe06/114_412_5041_3025/master/5041.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81061526b3ae4da4f66c73769437425e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06029c187964364147f11693795ab821044332c/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9919be4640f24dd12710a87bb6c7d31 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24b6b51d3908150d8b384b2d4ebd5d59b3fad8d/0_136_5073_3044/master/5073.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=11962280a4dba33991a88ae53249ad95 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Czech+Republic%2CRussia%2CEspionage%2CBoris+Nemtsov%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/wolf-cubs-on-way-as-belgium-becomes-wolf-crossroads-of-europe,world, Wolf cubs on way as Belgium becomes 'wolf crossroads of Europe', She-wolf in country’s north is pregnant  and newcomers from France or Italy spotted in south, Flanders’ environment minister  Zuhal Demir  announced that a pair of wolves in the north of the country were expecting cubs  four months after arrival in the area of a female wolf  Noëlla  who was billed as “a potential new love” for a previously lone wolf  August. “I am proud to announce that she-wolf Noëlla and wolf August are expecting wolf cubs ” Demir wrote on Monday on her Facebook page  predicting there would not be long to wait. Wolves usually give birth in late April or early May. The minister vowed that the Limburg province where the wolves have made their territory would be strictly guarded to prevent Noëlla from succumbing to the same fate as Naya  the likely former mate of August  who officials believe was killed by hunters. Naya’s cubs also died  presumed to have been shot by hunters or to have starved. Over the weekend the charity Welkom Wolf announced that four wolves had arrived in the southern Belgian region of Wallonia in the first three months of the year  bringing the regional total to six. The four newcomers included three males from France or Italy and the first she-wolf in Belgium’s High Fens for 200 years. Welkom Wolf said a German she-wolf had joined a German male on the plateau of the High Fens  an area of boggy moor and woodland rich in rare plants  grasses and endangered black grouse. Jan Loos  the managing director of Welkom Wolf  said the female’s arrival would certainly lead to a wolf pack. “You can suppose it because when wolves [of the opposite sex] meet there is no other outcome possible than puppies ” he told the Guardian. Wolves returned to Belgium in 2011 after being wiped out during the 19th century. The wolves in Flanders are thought to have travelled from lowland Germany via the Netherlands  while the majority in Wallonia have come from French mountain regions. Both groups are from the same species but they have not mixed for more than 200 years. “These are two different streams of migrating wolves: one stream comes from the north and the other stream comes from the south and they are meeting each other now in Belgium … We seem to have become the crosspoint ” Loos said. Experts determine a wolf’s origins by taking DNA samples from excrement and matching them to a European database. Welkom Wolf remains concerned that wolves across Belgium lack protection from hunters. It previously criticised Flemish authorities for not doing enough after hunters were seen in a protected region around the time of Noëlla’s arrival. Loos said wolves were killed by hunters rather than farmers. “It’s really not that simple to kill a wolf ” he said  referring to the vast range of the typical lone wolf or couple. “You have to spend a lot of time in the woods  you have to be there for hours and days and days. No sheep breeder has time or interest to be there for days and days.” Farmers are allowed to erect electric fencing to keep out wolves and can claim compensation if sheep are killed despite their efforts. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08cf8e80d826d7a84b94dd9bb5b9012dc21b88c5/0_340_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b94936187552512f740ad9856afa2f0d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Belgium%2CAnimals%2CWildlife%2CEnvironment%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/firms-receiving-coronavirus-help-told-to-cut-executive-pay,business, Firms receiving coronavirus help told to cut executive pay, UK investor group also advises companies suspending dividends to review bonuses, Executives at listed businesses where pay awards remain high after receiving taxpayer-funded assistance risk “significant reputational ramifications”  say new remuneration guidelines from the Investment Association (IA). Those companies that have suspended their dividends  a move that directly impacts fund managers’ returns  should also consider clawing back bonuses already paid out or cut 2020 bonuses  the IA said. Its members  which include BlackRock  Legal & General Investment Management and Vanguard  as well as pension funds for major companies  manage more than £7tn in assets  giving them weight in any vote against pay awards. There are no limits on executive pay attached to the government’s various emergency support schemes  but investors are concerned large payments could prove controversial at a time of unprecedented crisis. Many of the UK’s largest companies have said they plan to use the job retention scheme  under which the government will pay 80% of furloughed workers’ salaries up to £2 500 per month. Other support measures include loans backed by the government available to businesses of all sizes. More than a third of FTSE 100 companies  including all those so far publicly claiming taxpayer support for furloughed workers  have already announced cuts to executive pay. However  there are concerns that some companies may carry on with pre-crisis pay policies. The Institute of Directors (IoD)  which represents company bosses  on Monday backed the call for companies to carefully consider any payouts. “Nothing is normal for companies at the moment  and that should include remuneration ” said Edwin Morgan  the IoD’s director of policy. “Ideally  pay policy during a crisis would be designed to encourage the whole organisation to pull together. “State support is there to keep companies alive while the economy is frozen  and boards should think very carefully about how they reward executives  particularly when other stakeholders might be losing out.” So far 18 FTSE 100 companies have revealed they will furlough workers  including Primark’s owner  Associated British Foods  easyJet  and the British Airways owner  IAG  as well as the retailers Next and JD Sports and the broadcaster ITV. The 18 companies paid their chief executives an average of £3.6m per year over the five years before the crisis  according to data from the High Pay Centre published on Monday. The IA’s guidelines also suggest that investors will not look kindly on big pay packets to executives of companies who have asked investors for money. The guidelines said: “Where a company has sought to raise additional capital from shareholders  or has required government support such as furloughing employees  shareholders would expect this to be reflected in the executives’ remuneration outcomes.” The IA will urge companies in particular to limit bonus payments  which can in some cases be multiple times higher than fixed salaries. Investors have already raised concerns that some executives who have taken pay cuts may instead be given share awards under their so-called long-term incentive plans (LTIPs)  which could rise significantly in value if stock markets rebound to pre-pandemic levels. Executives should not be awarded the maximum bonuses allowed  given the extent of the share price falls suffered by many  the IA added. Chris Cummings  the IA’s chief executive  said: “Investment managers expect executive remuneration to be linked to long term company performance and aligned with the experience of its employees  stakeholders and shareholders. During this exceptional period we expect companies to adopt an approach that is appropriate to their business and the specific impacts of Covid-19  being careful to ensure that executives and the general workforce are treated consistently.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80109fc528f7ccdfaaa6ae58ef9fd328f309a54/0_537_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2371c8857735e7d55b4900986d005c82 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Executive+pay+and+bonuses%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPrimark%2CAssociated+British+Foods%2CeasyJet%2CBritish+Airways%2CJD+Sports+Fashion%2CNext%2CITV%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CAirline+industry%2CFood+%26+drink+industry%2CRetail+industry%2CInvesting%2CFinancial+sector%2CFTSE https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/sales-of-almost-400000-uk-homes-stalled-due-to-coronavirus-lockdown-says-zoopla,business, Sales of almost 400 000 homes stalled due to lockdown  says Zoopla, UK website estimates £82bn worth of property transactions ‘in suspended animation’, The property website said that 373 000 sales had stalled since the end of March when ministers told people to delay their home moves if possible  and social distancing rules made valuations and viewings impossible. The majority of these sales were agreed between November 2019 and February 2020  and would have been expected to complete between April and June. Zoopla said the market was “in suspended animation” with those sales – which may still complete later in the year – along with others agreed based on viewings that took place before 26 March  being placed on pause. Since that time  the website said demand from new buyers had fallen by 70%. As a result  it expected the number of sales over the course of the year to be just half of 2019’s figure. This is a steeper fall than that forecast by the property firm Knight Frank  which has suggested completions will drop from 1.17m last year to just 734 000 this year. Zoopla said the number of new sales agreed was running at about a 10th of the level achieved in early March  “with volumes similar to what you would expect to see in late December”  when the market is traditionally quieter. Those who are still making offers may be tempted by low mortgage rates and a lack of competition from other buyers. Last week  Zoopla’s rival Rightmove said buyers were making offers based on virtual viewings of properties  and builders have reported sales being agreed despite marketing suites remaining closed. The delay in completions means estate agents will have to wait longer for their commission. Zoopla estimated that commission payments on the 373 000 stalled sales added up to £1bn. Despite the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic  there is little sign that people are being forced to pull out of purchases. Zoopla said the rate of sales falling through had peaked on 23 March  but the outlook “depends upon how long the restrictions remain in place  the scale of the economic impact  and how this impacts would-be buyers and their ability to proceed with sales”. Knight Frank said that four in five purchases were still going ahead and that newly agreed sales were not attracting big discounts. Before lockdown  agreed prices were on average 97% of asking price and that had since dropped to 93%. Richard Donnell  the director of research at Zoopla  said: “Many households have spent more time at home in the last few weeks and some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working. “This could boost activity in the second half of 2020  but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment.” Donnell said it was too early to see what impact the crisis would have on prices. “Demand is rising but there is a long way to go until we see a return to typical levels of market activity.” Jennifer Boon and her husband are among those who have been forced to put their moving plans on ice. “We live in a two-bedroom flat and we’ve got a baby so we needed more room and somewhere a bit more residential to live. “In early March  we accepted an offer on our flat and had an offer accepted on a house in Finchley. The chain wasn’t complete – our sellers have still to find somewhere – but we had hoped to move in the summer. We’ve had our valuation done – it must have been one of the last ones that did get done – and the legal work has started  but it’s on pause. “We plan to go ahead still  and as far as we know our buyers are still interested. It is quite hard at the moment. I’m on maternity leave but I will be swapping with my husband and whoever is looking after the baby is effectively in her bedroom with her all day. It would be easier in our new house.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2bcd2ec85ae150bca50e729321a3d8890cd545/0_36_3430_2058/master/3430.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4470779b7de250d75158a3276325ed08 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Housing+market%2CReal+estate%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CProperty%2CMoney%2CHouse+prices%2CRightmove https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/sunak-backs-down-and-offers-small-firms-100-loan-guarantees,politics, Sunak backs down and offers small firms 100% loan guarantees, UK companies will be able to borrow up to £50 000 to cope with coronavirus outbreak, In a climbdown following mounting pressure on the government to overhaul its emergency loan scheme after thousands of cash-starved firms were denied support  the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  said small firms would be offered new “bounce back loans” from next week with full government backing. Sunak had said as recently as last week he was “not persuaded” by calls to provide a 100% state guarantee  despite less than half of all applicants for support securing an emergency loan. Designed to provide smoother access to cash for small companies facing difficulty accessing existing government-backed lending  Sunak said businesses would be able to apply for “micro-loans” worth up to 25% of their turnover  up to £50 000. The chancellor had faced rising pressure from business groups and Labour to boost the generosity of the government guarantee on its emergency loan scheme during the pandemic. However  Sunak stopped short of providing a 100% guarantee to big firms  saying taxpayers shouldn’t be exposed to the risks of large company failures. Announcing the scheme in parliament  Sunak said small firms could apply for the new loans from high-street banks from as early as next Monday. “I know that some small businesses are still struggling to access credit. They are in many ways the most exposed businesses to the impact of the coronavirus and find it hard to access credit in the first place. They will need extra support to get through this crisis ” he said. The new loans provide high-street banks with a guarantee that the state will refund the bank for the entire value of the loan if a borrower is unable to repay  up from 80% on the government’s existing coronavirus business interruption loan (CBILs). Although firms do not get government money if they cannot repay a loan  the scheme is designed to encourage banks to lend to firms when they might ordinarily turn down a loan application  because the state shoulders all of the risk. The Treasury had previously resisted calls to offer 100% guarantees  believing that banks needed to share the risk with taxpayers. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference last week  the chancellor said: “I’m not persuaded that moving to a 100% guarantee is the right thing to do.” Although other countries including Switzerland have offered 100% guarantees on emergency lending  Sunak said Britain had offered firms much more help through other means  including tax cuts and wage subsidies  meaning such steps were not required. However  thousands of businesses across the country have continued to complain that the CBILs scheme was cumbersome and included too many financial hurdles that many businesses were unable to overcome. The business lobby group the CBI  and the governor of the Bank of England  Andrew Bailey  had intervened in recent weeks  suggesting that an increase in the state-backed guarantee to 100% would help to remove bottlenecks and speed up the lending process. Although buckling to pressure to offer full backing to small firms  Sunak dismissed calls to expand the emergency loan scheme for all companies  telling parliament: “We should not ask that ordinary taxpayers today and tomorrow to bear the entire risk of lending almost unlimited sums to businesses who may in some cases have very little prospect of paying those loans back and not necessarily because of the impact of the coronavirus.” The former chancellors George Osborne  Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid  and the shadow business secretary  Ed Miliband  had all called on Sunak to move to 100% government-backed business loans. Miliband said it was welcome that Sunak had changed his mind  but added: “There remain very serious issues about the working of CBILs for small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking more than £50 000 support. They will be asking why they cannot have quick turnaround loans to get them through the crisis and whether CBILs will remain as slow and cumbersome as it has so far been.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c3c9c1ebf3847c5ea4b38fe8caf56a5a8caf9a/601_113_3387_2034/master/3387.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb329411d629f44d8e978c852ea57adf https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rishi+Sunak%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CBanking%2CBank+of+England https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/norwegian-air-says-most-of-fleet-will-stay-grounded-until-2021-due-to-coronavirus,business, Norwegian Air says most of fleet will stay grounded until 2021, Airline sets out case for coronavirus bailout that will cut share value by extra 95%, At the beginning of a critical fortnight for the airline  Norwegian laid out the scale of the task ahead – and the hit it expects bondholders  aircraft lessors and shareholders to take in order for the airline to access a 3bn kroner (£230m) state bailout. Even that may not be enough  it warned  in its “base scenario”  where operations only restart in earnest next summer. Currently just seven of a fleet of 147 planes are not grounded as they are being used for state-subsidised domestic flights in Norway  mainly for essential cargo. The airline is planning for a “New Norwegian” to emerge  focusing on key profitable routes  jettisoning long-haul routes to secondary airports  and using a fleet up to 30% smaller than previously planned. Bondholders will later this week decide whether to accept the strategy and allow the debt to be converted into equity  a necessary move if Norwegian is to gain access to state funds. Norwegian’s aircraft lessors will also be asked to take equity in the company  rather than pursue debts. The airline is looking to reduce its obligations on leasing planes by $500m (£403m). Shareholders will vote on the proposal at an emergency general meeting on 4 May. If the plan is approved  new shares will be issued on 11 May  which will reduce the value of current shares by another 95%. The carrier grounded its fleet in mid-March due to coronavirus travel restrictions  and has temporarily laid off more than 80% of its workforce. Before the outbreak  Norwegian claimed to be on track to restore its balance sheets to sound health after years of rapid but financially precarious expansion. It had pioneered low-cost long-haul flights  and grown significant bases abroad  becoming one of the biggest airlines at London Gatwick  as well as establishing a big presence in cities such as Rome and Paris. Although it says the current restructuring and state aid will be a buffer only for the next six to nine months  the airline’s prospects of survival – albeit heavily pruned - may be stronger now than in recent years  when rivals regularly predicted its demise. Political support has grown for the oil-rich Norwegian state to preserve the flag-carrier  in some form. An emergency amendment to bankruptcy laws could be passed to mirror the Chapter 11 rules in the US  which have allowed airlines to continue operating during insolvency. John Strickland  an industry analyst from JLS Consulting  said: “Everything hinges on the emergency meeting next week. Logically  the Norwegian government’s interest is only going to be in services in and out of Norway – which are likely to be short-haul only. It’s reasonable to imagine  even with that funding being granted  that we would see a significant reduction in the scale of Norwegian’s operations going forward.” Meanwhile  the resumption of UK leisure flights is likely to remain some way off  despite the announcement by the low-cost carrier Wizz that it would restart flying from Luton Airport as early as 1 May – mainly offering services to Romania  which has indicated it will ease restrictions from 15 May  and Bulgaria. Both countries are home to large numbers of seasonal agricultural workers in Britain. The airline does not expect to have to enforce social distancing due to the small number of passengers likely to fly for “essential travel”. A Luton Airport spokesperson said the airport was open and the decision to operate flights was a matter for airlines  adding: “Any passengers using these services will need to adhere to all restrictions imposed both in the UK and in the country of travel.” Virgin Atlantic Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group says it is not looking to sell the airline  after appointing bankers Houlihan Lokey to look for new investors. Branson however could potentially sell down his majority 51% stake. The US carrier Delta  which owns 49%  has said it will not put further funds into Virgin Atlantic as it seeks to preserve its own core operation. Virgin Atlantic says it remains in “constructive talks” with the UK government  which has batted away its initial requests for help worth £500m in loans and credit guarantees. EasyJet As a listed firm with aircraft assets  EasyJet was able to tap the government and Bank of England for a £600m loan under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility. It says it can now survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn. Lufthansa Shares rose in the German airline on Monday after ministers insisted that they would not let the flag-carrier be a casualty of the pandemic. Talks continue towards a multibillion state bailout. The group’s Austrian Airlines subsidiary has already been pledged €870m (£759m) by Austria’s government. Air France-KLM About €10bn in total will be provided by the French and Dutch governments to bail out the twin national carriers  in the form of credit guarantees and loans. The Netherlands has demanded executive pay cuts and the suspension of dividends and bonuses. US carriers Two pots of $25bn have been earmarked for airlines from the US’s $2.2tn stimulus package. The first will provide grants and cheap loans according to each airline’s payroll  and be given on condition of keeping staff employed. Airlines can apply for additional loans from the second pot. The biggest carriers  such as United  American Airlines and Delta  are expected to receive up to $5bn each from the first tranche. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/698c00ce1b3e099ea9104ae1f86ea46bf9d6afb0/0_266_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0556207f435caf7dbc2923b7b824911 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Airline+industry%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news%2CNorway%2CGatwick+airport%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAir+transport%2CEurope%2CBusiness+travel%2CTransport%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
28/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uks-lowest-paid-most-at-risk-during-covid-19-crisis-report-finds,world, UK's lowest paid most at risk during Covid-19 crisis  report finds, Study says 8.6m key workers have jobs with greatest threat to health and finances, More than a month into the UK’s lockdown  the Resolution Foundation thinktank said jobs in shutdown parts of the economy were lower paid than average  with as many as one in four of the lowest earners in society working in sectors forced into temporary closure  compared with less than one in 20 of the highest paid. As the government comes under rising pressure to outline an exit strategy from lockdown conditions  the thinktank’s report said the health risks from Covid-19 and the economic fallout would be far greater for some than others. Identifying 8.6 million key workers putting their health at risk to keep the country running  the study found women were more than twice as likely than men to occupy these roles. Dominated by almost 4 million health workers  as well as education  food and pharmaceutical retail staff  parents are also more likely to be key workers  including as many as two in five working mothers. The thinktank said key workers  such as nurses  teachers and care workers  typically earn less than employees further away from the centre of the crisis  with the bottom 30% of earners in Britain more than twice as likely to be in such jobs than the top 10%. As well as health risks facing women and low-income workers in sectors where staff are still going into work  the Resolution Foundation identified 6.3 million people in areas of the economy that have been ordered to shut down  including in hospitality  retail  arts  travel and leisure. It said jobs in sectors that have been effectively forced to close were typically lower paid than average  putting workers in these areas at greater risk of financial hardship as redundancies mount. One in four of the lowest 10% of all UK earners work in sectors where activity has ground to a halt amid tight restrictions on social and business life across Britain  compared with less than one in 20 of the highest paid. Young people are particularly likely to work in mothballed sectors  given the higher numbers of young adults in hospitality or retail  where their employers have been forced to close. As the generation to experience the toughest squeeze on pay following the 2008 financial crisis  the report warned that almost a quarter of millennials – born between 1981 and 2000 – currently work in shuttered sectors  compared with 16% of working baby boomers and other older adults born before them. Research around the world has shown that the impact of the pandemic will be unevenly felt by different groups in society. According to analysis of the first few weeks of unemployment benefit claims in Norway seen by the Guardian  the Norwegian labour ministry found workers with low wages  low education  and limited economic resources were overrepresented among the first to lose their jobs. In Britain about 1.8 million people have so far signed up to claim universal credit  with unemployment spiralling as the economy heads into the deepest recession since at least the second world war. Although the government is providing billions of pounds of emergency financial support to companies and individuals  millions are still expected to fall through the safety net. Maja Gustafsson  a researcher at the Resolution Foundation  said that as the government started to consider lifting lockdown conditions  it was vital that it focused on supporting those who have been at the centre of the current crisis. “Women  young people and the low-paid are most likely to be bearing the biggest health and economic risks from the crisis  which has shone a spotlight on the vitality of work that has been undervalued and underpaid for far too long ” she added. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f7b84b06afbb9840a08f26b8ca8e18def81446/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d66c0f0afa93ec68380b3cc67948c9ea https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CGig+economy%2CNational+living+wage%2CMinimum+wage%2CLiving+wage%2CUK+news%2CNHS https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure,world, Boris Johnson returns to face critics amid talk of the 'new normal', PM back in No 10 as ministers warn physical distancing is here to stay after lockdown, With the prime minister pressed to explain how schools and businesses can reopen without putting lives at risk  the government has given the clearest signal yet of how it hopes to manage the next phase of the pandemic  including imposing quarantine restrictions on all arrivals at UK airports. Hospital deaths from the virus announced on Sunday were 413  taking the total to 20 732. That was the lowest daily total since the end of March  though is expected to increase again during the week. Dominic Raab  who has been deputising since Johnson was taken into hospital with Covid-19 at the start of the month  said on Sunday it was inconceivable that children could return to school  without “further measures” to check the spread of the virus. He also suggested businesses hoping to return to work in what he called the “second phase” of the crisis would have to learn from the essential shops and other workplaces that have remained open  giving the example of distanced queues outside supermarkets. “There are all sorts of precautions that businesses have taken. If you think that those are the measures that we’ve taken for essential businesses that haven’t shut down  you can see how in various different ways they could be expanded to non-essential businesses currently closed ” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We won’t just have this binary easing up of measures. We will end up moving to a new normal.” Johnson  who has been easing his way back into work with video conference calls  and a three-hour meeting with key ministers at Chequers on Friday  will be back at his desk in No 10  amid growing pressure from some in his own party to lift restrictions. Raab said Johnson would be “back at work full-time  properly  at the helm” and is “raring to go”. The lockdown measures  imposed on 23 March  are due to be formally reviewed by 7 May. The prime minister’s personal role in the earlier stage of managing the outbreak has come under criticism in his absence  while the government has been under relentless pressure over the lack of PPE for frontline health workers  and the shortfall in testing. Matt Hancock  the health secretary  finally announced last week that he will seek 18 000 volunteers to track and trace Covid-19 cases. Labour has been calling for contact-tracing for weeks  as have public health experts and Hancock’s predecessor Jeremy Hunt. Health checks and quarantine restrictions for passengers arriving at airports have also been implemented by many other countries. Confirming the government is now considering such measures  Raab insisted that medical advice had previously suggested this would not be effective while the virus was freely circulating within the UK. In a letter to Johnson at the weekend  the Labour leader  Sir Keir Starmer  said: “I fear we are falling behind the rest of the world.” The chancellor  Rishi Sunak  will underline the costs of shuttering the economy to tackle the crisis on Monday  as he makes a statement to the House of Commons on the Treasury’s response to the crisis. He will point to forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that suggested a three-month lockdown could lead to a catastrophic 35% decline in GDP in the second quarter of the year. Sunak is among those cabinet ministers who have been keen to see some businesses reopen  and officials have been working on proposals for deciding which should come first – based on how easy it would be for them to work safely  and how critical they are to the economy. Raab is cautious about lifting restrictions too soon  however  and during several interviews on Sunday  repeatedly stressed the risks of avoiding a second peak in infections  which he said would damage the economy  as well as public health. “We’ve got to make sure of two things: first of all we don’t risk a second spike  for all the reasons we’ve discussed. Secondly  that overall this package doesn’t allow the coronavirus to get back hold  to spread more widely and to undo all the progress we’ve made  or the sacrifices so many people have made ” he said. He also echoed the warning of Prof Chris Whitty  the chief medical officer  that a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available this year. The TUC is calling for businesses to be obliged to make a comprehensive risk assessment before they can reopen. “We need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority” said its general secretary  Frances O’Grady. “Too many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. “We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won’t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.” Polling carried out for the TUC showed 40% of workers are concerned about the health risks of returning to their workplace. O’Grady called for bosses who put the health of their staff at risk to be prosecuted. Raab declined to say what physical distancing in schools might mean in practice – though Nicola Sturgeon  the Scottish first minister  suggested that in Scotland it could involve staggered attendance by different year groups. “It would not be right or safe to open schools right now and that may continue to be the case for some time to come  but the point I think everybody is trying to get their heads round right now is that as we come out of these very restrictive measures we’re not going to be going back to normality as we knew it ” Sturgeon told Marr. “It’s what I described – and many others have used this phrase – a new normal that we’re looking for where social distancing will be a fact of life for quite some time to come and different ways of operating will have to be contemplated.” The shadow education secretary  Rebecca Long-Bailey  called the government to consult with the teaching unions about how best to manage children’s return to school when it is safe to do so. “School leaders  teachers and support staff have been working tirelessly to keep children’s education going during this crisis and to minimise disruption and the inevitable impact on social inequality. Any decision to lift restrictions cannot be sprung upon schools at short notice ” she said. In another sign of the scale of disruption to normal life  the environment secretary  George Eustice  repeated his call for furloughed workers to go to the aid of Britain’s farmers  by picking fruit and vegetables during the harvest season this summer. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5554b2fca8fd5323bd91e3be7a94a50f88cb3ab/0_178_4214_2528/master/4214.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15cbaf8a988d180502c0c69bd66d5e71 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/attendees-of-sage-coronavirus-meetings-worried-by-presence-of-dominic-cummings,world, Attendees of Sage meetings worried by presence of Cummings, Scientists on UK government’s coronavirus advisory group say Dominic Cummings was an active participant, One attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said they felt Cummings’ interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process. A second Sage attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions  in February  because they believed the group should be providing “unadulterated scientific data” without any political input. The Guardian’s revelation on Friday that Sage attendees have included Cummings and Ben Warner  who worked together on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit  caused a storm of controversy over the weekend. Downing Street is insisting there is nothing untoward about the pair’s attendance at Sage meetings  saying they are largely taking part as silent observers. “It is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply [Sage] advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions ” a Downing Street spokesperson said. “It is entirely right that No 10 advisers attend to better understand the scientific debate and the decisions that need to be taken.” However  the two other Sage attendees the Guardian spoke to painted a different picture to that presented by No 10  which has been striving to play down the influence of the two advisers. Both Sage attendees declined to be named. “I have been concerned sometimes that Sage has become too operational  so we’ve ended up looking as though we are making decisions ” one of them said  making clear that Cummings had been involved on those occasions. “It contravenes previous guidelines about how you make sure you get impartial scientific advice going through to politicians  who make the decisions.” Referring to both Cummings and Warner  the Sage attendee added: “When a very senior civil servant or a very well-connected person interrupts  then I don’t think anyone in the room feels the power to stop it. When you get to discussing where advice might be going  there have been occasions where they have been involved  and a couple of times I’ve thought: that’s not what we are supposed to be doing.” A second Sage attendee said Cummings had played an active role meetings from February onwards. They said they were initially shocked to discover Cummings was taking part in a meeting of supposedly independent scientific experts. “He was not just an observer  he’s listed as an active participant ” the source said. “He was engaging in conversation and not sitting silently.” The second attendee said Cumming’s involvement was worrying because of his reputation in Whitehall and the questions his participation raises about Sage’s role as a neutral body of expert advisers. The reaction from the two Sage attendees contrasts with that of Prof Neil Ferguson  the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have played a guiding role in the government’s response to Covid-19. He appeared unconcerned when asked  in a video interview  about Cummings attending Sage meetings. “There have been a number of observers at those meetings  who have not interfered with business at all ” he replied. Sage membership is not fixed  but changes according to the nature of the crisis being faced. Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra  the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office. The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings  a government spokesperson said Vallance “would not have to sign off” observers or representatives from government departments. The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However  unlike Cummings and Warner  they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance. George Eustice  the environment secretary  was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday’s Downing Street press conference. He said it was “convened in response to specific emergencies  and the scientists that go on to that group will change  depending on the type of emergency.” He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published. Stephen Powis  the national medical director for England  appearing alongside Eustice  said he would have “no problem” with the names of those who attend being made public  provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing. On Saturday  Labour urged the government to ban political advisers from attending Sage. Jonathan Ashworth  the shadow health secretary  said there were significant questions for the government to answer over the credibility of its decision-making and how non-scientists have influenced policy. He said Cummings was “a political adviser  not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in Sage  the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.” The Conservative former Brexit secretary  David Davis  also criticised the attendance of Cummings and Warner at the Sage meetings. “The whole point of having Sage is you’re getting scientific advice based on the data  based on the best theories  and the best models we have at the time ” he told Sky News. “You don’t want any outside influences  either direct or indirect  either deliberate or accidental.” However the former Conservative chancellor  Sajid Javid  argued it would be “worrying” if Cummings was not present at the Sage’s Covid-19 meetings  and criticised the Guardian’s reporting. “Media have a hugely important role in holding government to account  but some are courting public mistrust with non-stories ” Javid tweeted. “Time to act more responsibly.” The foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  said the government does not release the membership of the Sage committee because of the risk of pressure on members: “Sage do release their advice subsequently  normally a couple of weeks down the track  so it is properly tested carefully before being put out. We don’t release  as a matter of practice  the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure  undue influence.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59af64897155bda0c0453fe83df3e7c8d97483ed/0_0_3415_2050/master/3415.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8137c5524dcd4f58831cef5adfac4e96 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDominic+Cummings%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CConservatives%2CHealth+policy%2CPublic+services+policy%2CUK+news%2CSociety%2CGovernment+data%2CScience%2CInfectious+diseases%2CHealth%2CMedical+research%2CSajid+Javid%2CDominic+Raab%2CJonathan+Ashworth https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/post-brexit-trade-talks-with-eu-on-course-to-fail-johnson-warned,politics, Post-Brexit trade talks with EU on course to fail  Johnson warned, Prime minister expected to press EU leaders to dedicate attention to faltering negotiations, There is recognition on both sides of the talks that there is little prospect of agreement on the most contentious issues without a major reset of positions. With the prime minister set to return to Downing Street on Monday  Johnson is expected to press the European commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  and EU nation governments to dedicate attention to the negotiation with the British government. Sources suggested that there would need to be a rethink over the next fortnight in order to rescue the negotiation. The UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of 2020  after which tariffs will be applied to the trade in goods unless there is a deal agreed. Both sides have said they need to see progress by June  with Downing Street warning that they may need to walk away from the talks at that point to prepare solely for a no-deal outcome. There are just two scheduled rounds of video-conference talks  and senior sources on both sides said these were not likely to deliver a deal  due to principled differences as well as the difficulties presented by the technology. “You don’t see all the faces of the people around the table; you don’t see the body language  you cannot have discussion in the margins”  an EU official said. “But having said that  this is how we are working now; we need to make the best of it.” The EU’s chief negotiator  Michel Barnier  and his British counterpart  David Frost  came out fighting from last week’s round of talks on the future relationship  only the second since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier accused the UK of not engaging with key issues of particular importance to the EU  including access to British waters for European fishing fleet and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental  labour and social standards. EU sources added that UK officials “listened politely” to their proposals but did not seek to negotiate on them. “I regret it  and this worries me”  Barnier told reporters at a press conference at the end of last week’s talks. The British negotiating team has rejected the claim  instead questioning the value of the deal being proposed by Brussels  which would tie the UK to EU regulations while also constructing significant non-tariff barriers on trade. Whitehall sources said there was a difference between not engaging and simply disagreeing with the EU approach. There is a particular frustration on the UK side that the EU has rejected proposals to remove unnecessary technical barriers to trade  including some sanitary and phytosanitary checks on animal products  despite British commitments to maintain high standards and there being precedent in previous trade deals. On security cooperation  the UK has argued in the negotiating room that the EU’s offer is based on existing deals but comes with unprecedented obligations  including a direct role for the European court of justice in dispute settlements: a red line for Downing Street. Two areas in which there have been better talks are civil nuclear cooperation and UK involvement in EU programmes. “The UK has expressed interest in participating in [the research and science programme] Horizon  for example”  said an EU official. “So there’s certainly some useful discussions ongoing in this area.” However  there is growing concern about the UK’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement  which was designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. The protocol requires checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. “You need to have customs checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland  veterinary controls  a VAT system needs to be put in place”  said an EU official. The two sides are expected to have a stock check on 30 April at the next meeting of the joint committee  the body established to ensure implementation of the provisions in the withdrawal agreement. Frost has ruled out an extension of the transition period. The UK believes there is ample time to agree and ratify a free-trade deal if the EU changes its position. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f180ec54f251bcb7a1639eabf2c7efecbf7d68a1/0_121_3495_2098/master/3495.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d67de10b04e6af983e0856cfe1659699 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2a9bda14b6754c6bea03f9a8b7cca7cfcffbb4/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=816044a5bbf109507e5d43980d0183fd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2353af693c5c16711986512f1203975177b97e66/0_168_5336_3201/master/5336.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ba97a43adb806a6ae24ee7989159452 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4246ac41ff907d42a2810a64f1a7bae130a3932b/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd3966eae5e92bd67159fdc240fded08 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1cd7b2349e74d49029d0f72b5f365c96a47d4b/1732_781_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b220ac9016732bd3d1b847b1656dcbcb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CTrade+policy%2CUK+news%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/uk-could-become-cultural-wasteland-due-to-coronavirus-say-artists,world, UK could become 'cultural wasteland' due to coronavirus  say leading artists, Letter signed by hundreds of creative figures including PJ Harvey  Anish Kapoor and Rufus Wainwright calls on government support, The letter  which is written by Creative Industries Federation (CIF) and addressed to the chancellor and culture secretary  appeals for urgent funding for creative organisations and professionals who  it says  are “falling through the gaps of existing government support measures”. Signatories of the letter also include Anish Kapoor  Jeremy Deller and Jonathan Pryce  who argue the government “cannot allow the UK to lose half of its creative businesses and become a cultural wasteland”. The singer Rufus Wainwright  who also signed  told the Guardian artists “protect the minds and souls of a nation”  and it could be “criminal” for the UK to not support them during the crisis. He said: “Artists are creating so much content online that people can experience in their homes. They have not stopped producing and it would be a crime as a society to not support them through this crisis as they are nourishing us.” Wainwright added that Germany  which announced a federal aid package worth €50bn (£43 bn) for freelancers and small businesses with Berlin distributing €5 000 payments to individual freelancers (including artists)  was a country that has effectively supported the arts and the creative industries. In March  the UK chancellor  Rishi Sunak  unveiled plans to pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings  but was criticised when industry groups claimed many were ineligible for any financial support under the scheme. Arts Council England also announced a £160m emergency response package that gives artists access to cash grants of up to £2 500  with £50m available for organisations outside its national portfolio  and another £90m going to national portfolio organisations. Caroline Norbury  CEO of CIF  said the creative sector was in “deep trouble” despite the government funding meant to support workers who have been affected by Covid-19 lockdown measures. She said: “While government support measures for businesses and the self-employed are welcome  we know that there are still thousands of creative organisations and freelancers who are falling through the gaps  and who simply will not get through this crisis without urgent cash support.” The letter also references CIF research that shows that one in seven creative organisations have reserves to last until the end of April  with half having money that will last beyond June. The letter is the latest appeal for support from the government by leading British cultural figures. Last week  the artistic director of the National Theatre  Rufus Norris  told the Guardian that some theatres had only days before they could go out of business and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers. “If the furlough scheme doesn’t continue  yet we stay closed as an industry  then it’s very hard to imagine how the sector will survive ” he said. “I would like the government to increase and broaden the support of freelance artists who are suffering very badly.” Norris’s comments followed those of the playwright James Graham who said an “aggressive government bailout” was the way to ensure the sector survived Covid-19 and that “working-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces”. The international curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist told the Guardian a multimillion pound public arts programme  similar in scale to Franklin D Roosevelt’s Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and Works Progress Administration (WPA)  which was rolled out during the Great Depression in the 1930s  was needed to support artists during and after the Covid-19 outbreak. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7746c94ed0bd69f53ed843a85c74971df033c384/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52727feba375f4932041e9b882852971 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CArts+Council+England%2CCulture%2CTheatre%2CStage%2CRufus+Wainwright%2CUK+news%2CMusic%2CNick+Cave%2CPJ+Harvey%2CAnish+Kapoor%2CArt+and+design%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu,tv-and-radio, Normal People review – Sally Rooney's love story is a small-screen triumph, This BBC/Hulu adaptation of the hit novel about the on-again  off-again relationship between two Irish teenagers captures the beauty and brutality of first love perfectly, In the end it won’t matter. The rendering of the on-again-off-again relationship between sixth-form and then university students Marianne and Connell for the small screen  by Rooney herself with Alice Birch  is near-perfect from whichever direction you come at it. The show retains the pared-down approach of the book. The pair’s bond remains the sole concern  but various factors – some deliberate  some inherent to the medium – mitigate any possible tedium. Of the deliberate decisions  the greatest may be the one to divide the series into 12 half-hour episodes rather than the traditional six. It leaves you either wanting more  or relieved that you are not being asked to relive the exquisite agony of first love for any longer. Of the inherent differences  it is the breaking of the endless parsing of every action that dominates the book. But Rooney and Birch have resisted the temptation to recreate it. To have it shown instead of told refreshes the story for those who already know it  and will surely help engage those who are alienated by such interior detailing. Especially when the showing is done by such perfect lead actors as Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal (in his first television role). Edgar-Jones captures all of Marianne’s intensity and acumen  her brittleness and damage. Even before her backstory is given – which comes much earlier here than in the book – you can see how and why she feels herself unlovable and where that fatal flaw might lead. Mescal  meanwhile  conveys all of Connell’s intelligence  the shifting limits of his emotional maturity  the self-doubt and  vitally  the warmth that make him so attractive to Marianne  and the charm that makes his life so easy until they get to Trinity College. You can see the good man Marianne says he is  struggling to emerge from the cowardice of youth. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald  Normal People depicts all the embarrassments and excitements  horrors and humiliations  glories and grotesqueries of Marianne and Connell’s four years together (and not together  but always together) so intimately that it is impossible not to become immersed and impossibly moved. By the protagonists  and by the cataract of memories that will fall unbidden past your mind’s eye  if you’re old enough to have stored them safely away  you thought. From the ceaseless low-level bullying in the name of banter that Marianne faces at school and the ecstasy of the first kiss to the brutality of the first betrayal – all your formative experiences are here. The navigations and contradictions of sex. The compatibility and incompatibility of personalities. The opening up of new areas of conscience. The acquisition of emotional weaponry and armour. Do you remember? You will soon. I almost want to issue trigger warnings per episode but we didn’t get them first time round in real life and survived  so I’m hoping we can all just about manage in the face of even these pitch-perfect reproductions. The support around Mescal and Edgar-Jones is phenomenal  too. Marianne’s mother is  courtesy of a handful of lines from Aislín McGuckin  a mass of inner scar tissue pulling her forever out of spiritual shape  her brother Alan (Frank Blake) a frighteningly ordinary malignity in their lives. Connell’s mother Lorraine (Sarah Greene) conveys all the hope and disappointment of motherhood in almost as few scenes as she has in the book – and as with the book  leaves you longing for a sequel that tells her story in full. It’s a triumph in every way  from acting and direction to script  and if we see a better drama – certainly about adolescence  one which takes it seriously without treating it indulgently – this year  I’d be very surprised. It’s a beautiful  hugely beautiful thing. • This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to credit Hettie Macdonald as a director of the series. Lenny Abrahamson directed the first six episodes  and Macdonald directed the final six. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Lucy-Mangan,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac80477b5fecbdb9d0fb635d622b0eea https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ebb5f09ab0c256959afda8ff5b98642af33f28/517_890_3123_1874/master/3123.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=200f4ef144cc55e62b25a9fee8429d75 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Drama%2CTelevision%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture%2CSally+Rooney%2CYoung+people%2CAlice+Birch https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/six-urgent-items-in-boris-johnson-inbox-as-he-returns,politics, Six urgent items in Boris Johnson's inbox as he returns, The PM is back at work on Monday  with tough decisions to be made, Whitehall has been working on options – “doing the homework”  as Johnson’s deputy  Dominic Raab  put it on Sunday – but ministers have been reluctant to make any decisions without the prime minister. The health and social care secretary  Matt Hancock  is determined that the transmission rate of the virus – the R0  as it is known – be suppressed well below 1 before the lockdown is eased. He is also racing to get a track-and-trace system up and running to help control the virus when restrictions are eased. Meanwhile  the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  who unlike Hancock was present at a three-hour meeting in Chequers on Friday  is known to be keen to allow some businesses to reopen  given the catastrophic impact of a total shutdown on the economy. There are also growing anxieties over the impact of an extended lockdown on mental and physical health  domestic abuse and the welfare of vulnerable children. Johnson will have to make the ultimate decision about how to balance these and other concerns  with a formal review of the measures due by 7 May. Matt Hancock’s self-imposed deadline of completing 100 000 tests a day by the end of April expires this week. Capacity has ramped up significantly in recent days  with all key workers now able to apply for a test – but self-administered testing kits have been running out within minutes on the government’s website  and workers have complained that they cannot book a test slot anywhere locally. The government announced at the weekend that the army will now be involved in setting up mobile testing units. Hancock has insisted his goal remains achievable – but it looks a stretch  and some colleagues feel it was always a hostage to fortune. Johnson will have to choose whether to maintain No 10’s staunch backing of Hancock  or to distance himself from the pledge (though the prime minister himself suggested 250 000 tests a day would be achievable). He will also have to decide how much of the government’s effort should be focused on the tracking-and-testing approach Hancock now regards as crucial. Johnson will have to decide whether the decision-making structure in place through the peak of the crisis remains the right one for managing its next phase. In his absence  key decisions have been made by a “quad” of ministers: Sunak  Hancock  Raab and the Cabinet Office minister  Michael Gove  each of whom chair one of the four powerful Covid-19 committees that have been managing the government’s day-to-day response. At key turning points  decisions have also been rubber-stamped by the Cobra emergency committee  which includes representatives of Scotland  Wales  Northern Ireland and London  as well as ministers and experts. In turn  Cobra receives advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). The government has repeatedly insisted its approach has been “led by the science”  but the independence of Sage has been thrown into doubt by the revelation that Boris Johnson’s chief adviser  Dominic Cummings  has been attending its meetings  to the disquiet of some members. The prime minister will have to decide whether Cummings should continue to attend and more broadly  which stakeholders should be included in decision-making from now on. Some Tory MPs would like to see the Labour leader  Keir Starmer  bound in to deliberations about lifting lockdown  for example – and as parts of the economy reopen  the TUC have called for the formation of a national council for reconstruction and recovery  including unions and employers as well as government. Keir Starmer confronted Raab at his first prime minister’s questions as Labour leader in a largely empty House of Commons chamber last Wednesday. This week  it will be Johnson who has to face an interrogation  without the usual supportive roar from Tory backbenchers. It comes amid mounting questions about whether the prime minister was slow to react to the crisis at the start of the year: including whether he was right to allow Hancock to lead five early Cobra meetings on the virus. A series of early decisions have been challenged  including halting the tracing of cases  allowing mass events such as the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead  and failing to act quickly enough to secure supplies of PPE. Starmer made clear in a letter to the prime minister this weekend he will try to make some of this criticism stick – and will continue to press for more details on the government’s planned exit strategy. “I fear we are falling behind the rest of the world ” the Labour leader wrote  urging Johnson to promise that no one will have to travel more than 20 minutes to have themselves tested for the virus. The latest round of the (physically distanced) Brexit talks ended on Friday  with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. The government is accusing the EU of treating the UK more harshly than other counterparts in recent trade deals  while the EU fears ministers are backsliding on aspects of the Brexit deal struck last October. Boris Johnson is expected to ask the European commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  and EU leaders to intervene in the negotiations in the hope of breaking the deadlock. The government must decide in June whether to seek an extension to the status quo transition period  something ministers have repeatedly insisted they are determined not to do. Only two more rounds of videoconference negotiations are currently scheduled  but Johnson may hope that his personal involvement could help  as it did last autumn. Gove is likely to reveal more about the government’s thinking when he appears before the House of Commons EU future relationship committee on Monday. The Whitehall ethics adviser Alex Allan has reportedly completed his investigation into events surrounding the resignation of the former Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam  who accused Priti Patel of bullying – but it was set aside in the prime minister’s absence. Rutnam resigned on 29 February  claiming he had been “the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” . He has already announced that he is taking legal action against Patel under whistleblowing laws  with the case expected to focus on her treatment of civil servants. The prime minister tasked Allan with examining Patel’s alleged conduct  and whether it contravened the ministerial code. Johnson has previously backed Patel  saying he is “sticking by her”  but that could change if Allan finds she has broken the rules. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a8b2e7e68ff48609903aa7d559265fc1c938537/0_19_3349_2010/master/3349.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6f180e6414e7475d7f2911df3eeacfd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d8671f79a237b36a5ecf6ab958b425291e5af/288_163_3383_2030/master/3383.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7fe27f63807fb338db64dd93a9151b1 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093101ece8ed3bcccfd1f6fbca0a0105ea22b8e1/0_390_2615_1570/master/2615.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc091e2e0464e941b6f8585c2fb0ab5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4a656ca873623c8005f9eb8963c9908b6bab6b/0_66_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40ad26fb2fcdbae6122a50cfdb903cda https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa60b78f841d38918ee47df0cf9bf77becbd456/0_54_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74e3befe21a81882aba30cf28ae40145 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CDominic+Raab%2CMichael+Gove%2CMatt+Hancock%2CRishi+Sunak%2CConservatives%2CBrexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CPriti+Patel%2CDominic+Cummings%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/no-evidence-no-10-advisers-attended-sage-during-previous-crises-coronavirus-dominic-cummings,world, No evidence No 10 advisers attended Sage during previous crises, Covid-19 meetings appear to be first time political advisers such as Dominic Cummings have been present on advisory group, The Guardian revealed on Friday that the prime minister’s chief adviser  Dominic Cummings  and another No 10 aide who worked with him on the Vote Leave campaign have been attending Sage meetings. Downing Street has insisted it is “entirely right” for its political advisers to attend meetings of the group  which is supposed to provide the Cabinet Office with independent scientific advice on emergencies. Sage  which is chaired by the chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  was first convened to provide scientific advice on swine flu in 2009. Since then  almost 50 Sage meetings have been held  including those convened to respond to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull  the Fukushima nuclear disaster  2013 winter flooding  the ebola outbreak  an earthquake in Nepal  the Zika outbreak and the near-collapse of a dam at the Toddbrook Reservoir last year. There is no evidence in the publicly available minutes of those meetings of any Downing Street officials or political advisers attending. A spokesperson for the Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy did not dispute that Covid-19 Sage meetings marked the first time political advisers had attended. “The nature and scale of this emergency  which is impacting the UK in a more direct manner  differs from those that Sage has been mobilised for in the past and  as such  the rotating expert attendance and list of government officials involves a broader set of representatives ” the spokesperson said. Downing Street did not dispute the minutes. The government has been adopting an unusually combative approach to journalists in recent weeks after a slew of articles by investigative reporters raised questions about how ministers are responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday  when the Guardian revealed Cummings had attended Sage  Downing Street released a statement saying: “Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.” Last week  after the Sunday Times investigative report criticised Boris Johnson for failing take the pandemic seriously  the Department of Health published a blogpost saying the article contained “a series of falsehoods” and “actively misrepresents” the government’s response. The Sunday Times flatly denied the “kremlinesque” accusations from the government. After the Financial Times last week exposed the “muddled thinking” behind the government’s ventilator procurement plan  the Cabinet Office reacted with an almost 3 000-word retaliation  which also took aim at the personal tweets by the newspaper’s journalist Peter Foster. Reacting to Downing Street’s trenchant criticism of the Guardian’s reporting on Cummings and Sage over the weekend  Foster tweeted it was reminiscent of techniques used by Donald Trump’s White House to “muddy waters  create world of equal and alternative ‘facts’ and traduce media”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb00c453e850d1c23eb152858837cd9955e32e2/320_65_1268_761/master/1268.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b2864b92a8c5f47dd7db910c3b2d5f0f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CDominic+Cummings%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CPublic+services+policy%2CScience%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall,world, Coronavirus crisis may leave English councils with £5bn funding shortfall, Local authorities say more government action needed after data shows massive financial blackhole, An analysis of the financial returns compiled by 44 of England’s largest councils shows that by the end of this financial year they will be in the red by £2.2bn. If spending and losses at all councils continue to mount at predicted rates  the aggregated total for all English local authorities would be more than £8bn for the year  or £5bn after the first wave of government bailouts. Local government spending in England is about £50bn a year. Councils have spent hundreds of millions more than expected during the lockdown on providing social care  personal protective equipment for staff  housing rough sleepers  and supplying emergency food packages  while losing even larger amounts in lost revenues from council tax  parking charges and leisure fees. Although ministers have provided £3.2bn in two crisis bailouts in recent weeks  councils are warning much of this has already been spent – and some are understood to be drawing up fresh provisional cuts to balance their books  which would lead to services being drastically reduced  from waste disposal to arts  libraries and leisure. The unprecedented financial pressure has already forced a handful of councils to invoke controversial emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act  which allow them to suspend legal duties to provide aspects of social care – cost-saving measures that charities and human rights groups have warned will put older and disabled people at risk. The study of returns by councils in the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities (Sigoma)  which includes authorities in Manchester  Leeds  Newcastle  Leicester and Nottingham  suggests this group of 47 authorities alone anticipate extra Covid-19 spending pressures totalling £720m over the year. This is dwarfed by the potential drying up of vital municipal income streams  estimated at £1.4bn. This includes a loss of more than £400m in business rates  a £288m loss in council tax caused by residents who have lost their jobs cancelling direct debits payments  and a £341m loss in fees and charges. Extrapolated across the entire English local government landscape  this would leave councils with a funding shortfall of about £5bn after the recent cash bailouts. Sir Stephen Houghton  the chair of Sigoma and leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council  said that if the government does not step in  many councils will consider issuing bankruptcy notifications  called section 114 notices. “Even for those councils that are not at that cliff edge  the ability to deliver key services effectively – children services  adult services and waste management  for example – will be in question. Houghton said: “Services may be running now but we will see the effect will come through in six to 12 months’ time. You get to a point where the frequency of waste collection is cut and the time taken to assess vulnerable peoples needs takes longer and so on. “The government needs to have a constructive dialogue with local government about the scale of the problem and negotiate both a package of measures including extra funding to keep local government in a stable position.” Although the Sigoma councils are located predominantly in the urban north and Midlands  a separate Local Government Chronicle analysis shows similar problems are faced by smaller district councils  many in affluent Conservative heartlands in the south of England  which are massively reliant on fees and charges for income. Last week  Windsor and Maidenhead district council in Berkshire  which is in former prime minister Theresa May’s constituency  formally informed ministers it was poised to announce bankruptcy because while coronavirus pressures had created a predicted £14m shortfall it had just £6m in reserves Councils affected range from Greater Manchester Combined Authority  which disclosed on Friday that coronavirus will leave the city’s 10 borough councils £541 million out of pocket  to authorities in Oxfordshire  which said they stood to lose £100m as a result of coronavirus costs. Newcastle-under-Lyme borough council in Staffordshire has said it had already used all its £65 000 bailout share from the government to house 21 homeless people. Stephen Sweeney  the deputy council leader  said: “It’s gone now. We have £1.5m in reserves  you don’t need to do the maths to see how long before we get problems.” Responding to the figures compiled by Sigoma  a government spokesperson said: “The secretary of state has announced £3.2bn of funding for councils to support their response to the pandemic. This new funding will support them through immediate pressures faced by councils to respond to coronavirus and protect vital services.”  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b9766e8f24cd0cd7d7cd9b6b11889e008008efa/0_159_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=620d31810436c5ff3eee791da55f5982 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CLocal+government%2CPublic+finance%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CPublic+services+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/the-key-areas-to-look-at-in-easing-the-uk-coronavirus-lockdown,world, The key areas to look at in easing the UK coronavirus lockdown, From schools to shops  with jobs at risk  the government must balance the interests of economy and public safety, More than 20 000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons  Johnson’s economics adviser when he was London mayor  warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader  Keir Starmer  also called on ministers to start talking to teachers  businesses  trade unions and town hall leaders and open “honest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like”. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion  but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge. One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch “zero-contact” stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment  prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK  the firm said. Clothes shops could reopen  but with changing rooms off limits  according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted  promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens  as seen in some supermarkets  and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart. Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office  which is responsible for border security  and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day “stay at home” notices  similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens  with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Whether it is a quarantine period  or testing or other measures that might be taken  it is possible.” Ibstock  one of Britain’s biggest brick-makers  will restart production on Monday  and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown  with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation  however  many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK’s biggest housebuilders  Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday  with Persimmon’s chief executive  David Jenkinson  saying the firm has “new site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures”. Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends  in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules  it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working. After the deaths of taxi drivers  care workers  nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work  trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues  and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed  enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult. “We need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority ” said Frances O’Grady  general secretary of the TUC. “Too many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won’t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.” The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary  Priti Patel  said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be “irresponsible and get hopes up”. Raab  said it would be “inconceivable” to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting. Labour is applying pressure though  with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning “young people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education”. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home  with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345022ca803439712ae318d5e0271bfaa8677e5/138_0_3292_1977/master/3292.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ad63ace8fa0bac6333ef0a39208d216 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSchools%2CConstruction+industry%2CRetail+industry%2CBusiness%2CEducation%2CTrade+unions%2CTUC%2CPolitics%2CDominic+Raab%2CBoris+Johnson%2CKeir+Starmer https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/john-lewis-to-reopen-factory-to-make-covid-19-gowns-for-nhs,business, John Lewis to reopen factory to make Covid-19 gowns for NHS, Store brings workers out of furlough to produce medical-grade gear for north-east trust, The department store’s Herbert Parkinson factory is bringing back 15 expert sewers from furlough  who will use medical-grade fabric to make washable protective gowns for staff at the Northumbria NHS foundation trust which runs at least nine hospitals and other clinical centres in the north-east. The move comes amid a shortage of protective equipment for NHS workers  and particularly protective gowns made with the non-woven  spun bond  laminate called SMMS  which John Lewis will use. Hospitals have turned to local businesses to help out as supplies of protective wear have been depleted. British textile firms have said they are desperate to contribute by making protective gear for the NHS  but central government has been slow to take up their offers of help. Sir James Mackey  the chief executive of Northumbria Healthcare NHS foundation trust  said: “We will be forever grateful for this support from John Lewis which will directly  and positively  impact on our frontline workers and patients – helping to keep them safe. “It is clear  we can only tackle the challenges faced through utilising local channels and relationships to do so. It is this spirit of pulling together that has helped us to achieve so many things over recent weeks at pace and without any outside influence. We need to embrace with open arms all offers of help and turn these into actions that support our staff and patients.” Stuart McDonald  the head of Herbert Parkinson  said the factory expected to produce 2 000 gowns a week. He said: “We’re all looking forward to reopening our factory and threading our sewing machines again to play our part in helping the NHS.” John Lewis  which has been forced to close all its department stores under the government’s measures to control the spread of coronavirus  is also donating more than 20 000 metres of cotton fabric from its haberdashery departments and warehouses to voluntary groups making scrubs  which are worn under protective gear  for the NHS. For the Love of Scrubs and Scrubs Glorious Scrubs  which have thousands of volunteers sewing at home  are expected to make about 6 000 scrubs with the material. John Lewis said it had already donated more than 400 metres of fabric to similar groups making face masks and scrubs for their local hospitals  pharmacies  care homes and communities. John Lewis is the latest textile maker to turn its hands to making protective equipment. British brand Barbour  best known for its waxed jackets  has made disposable gowns and medical scrubs from its South Shields factory for the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne  while Mulberry has switched its handbag factory in Somerset to making 8 000 gowns for NHS workers in Bristol. Burberry  best known for its coats  last week confirmed it has transformed its factory in Castleford to manufacture non-surgical gowns for the NHS. Scottish fabric specialist Don & Low has developed a spunbond laminate fabric that would meet the same international standard as SMMS. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce21eb5380acc818251dfaf87e288e1c2163d490/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b871b4d245e8a58d9db4c05742eaf3e9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=John+Lewis%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CHospitals%2CNHS%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-uk-government-assessing-antibody-test-kits,world, Coronavirus UK: government assessing antibody test kits, Ministers considering ordering millions of tests although concerns remain over accuracy, The foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  confirmed on Sunday that the government was assessing the new antibody kits in the hope of using them to reveal how many people have recovered from the infection and presumably acquired some level of immunity. If the tests are accurate enough  they could potentially identify individuals who are at least in part protected against the virus  and shed light on how much of the population has been exposed. But Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that it was still unclear whether the tests were reliable enough to roll out at scale. An ideal test would detect all those with antibodies to the virus and produce negative results for anyone who has not been infected. A flawed test that mistakenly suggests people are immune when they are not could be extremely dangerous if those people returned to work in care homes or hospitals. According to a report in the Mail on Sunday  the government has ordered up to 50m new antibody test kits developed by the newly formed Rapid Testing Consortium at Oxford University. But Raab cast doubt on that claim  telling Marr he was not sure if they had been ordered  and that doubts remained about their quality. The consortium’s leader  Jonathan Allis  told the Mail on Sunday: “We are close to picking up 100% of all cases where people have antibodies. Now it is just a question of scaling up the manufacturing process.” The Guardian understands that the test has not passed official performance criteria drawn up by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The report described the test as costing £10 and taking 20 minutes to reveal whether or not people have antibodies in their blood that can fight the coronavirus. It would analyse a pinprick of blood and show two lines for a positive test result. Those using the test will be asked to send a photo of the results to a central database. If the test is deemed to be effective  the consortium believes it could produce 1m per week by the summer  and up to 50m by next year  the report added. But some senior scientists warn that the focus on home testing kits for antibodies is unhelpful. Sir Jeremy Farrar  director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  tweeted on Sunday that while research on rapid and reliable antibody tests should continue apace  they were a “distraction until we have one”. The focus now  he said  must be on a massive increase in virus testing  lab-based checks for antibodies  isolation of the infected  contact tracing and clinical care. Earlier this month  Martin Hibberd  a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  pointed out that fingerprick tests for antibodies were rarely reliable for infectious diseases  and urged ministers to pour efforts into far more reliable lab-based antibody tests called Elisas  which are already being used by Public Health England and others to screen blood for Covid-19 antibodies. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62f9dd6fd3f9e48b194021392e28d48896434e1/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=087bbc6b6c02f4e026cbfa61ff6dbd2b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience%2CUK+news%2CDominic+Raab https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/only-half-of-uks-sickest-coronavirus-patients-put-on-ventilators,world, Only half of UK's sickest coronavirus patients put on ventilators, Evidence grows that many Covid-19 patients do better with non-invasive help, The rush to increase the number of ventilators in Britain from 8 000 to 18 000 was a response to early assumptions that intubation was the only way to save the lives of those who become severely ill. Industry was urged to switch production  and Dyson was among the companies volunteering to help  but it has now been told by the government its services are not needed. This may now look like an over-reaction  but one leading intensive care expert said the government had little choice. The Imperial College modelling prediction of 250 000 UK deaths was based partly on a shortfall in the number of ventilators in the NHS. “It is easy in retrospect ” said Mervyn Singer  a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London. “Governments had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.” Singer talked to colleagues in China and in Italy about their experiences before the UK’s intensive care units started to fill up. “We started off with a strategy to try to avoid intubation ” he said. The alternatives to mechanical ventilation include continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap). Cpap machines are a type of ventilator that uses a mask but delivers air at mild pressure without taking over the function of the lungs. It is believed Boris Johnson was treated with Cpap. Early fears were that healthcare workers would be more likely to be infected by Cpap patients  but at University College hospital that turned out to be unfounded. Singer and his colleagues wrote an algorithm for deciding which patients needed intubation and which could be given other forms of breathing support. They launched their care pathway on 20 March  the day that London’s Northwick Park hospital had to declare an emergency and send Covid-19 patients to other hospitals. “They were intubating everyone as per guidance and ended up with no ventilators left and had to declare a critical emergency ” said Singer. Around the world  doctors are increasingly reluctant to use mechanical ventilation for any but the severest cases. A study of outcomes in New York published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 88% of those put on mechanical ventilation in critical care units died. But that’s a Catch 22 situation  say UK experts. These were probably the sickest patients  whose lungs were barely functioning and would have died without invasive ventilation. Prof Anita Simonds  a consultant in respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton hospital  said the very poor outcome in New York patients was “probably not a fair assessment” because there were still patients in intensive care  so the survival rate may yet go up. “My view  which I think is fairly widely held  is that some of the comparisons being made are not apples and apples. As is appropriate with evolving information  these plans are iterative in how you manage patients. We’ve learned as we’ve gone along ” she said. For maybe 30% or even 50% of Covid patients  non-invasive Cpap ventilation with extra oxygen at high levels can be sufficient. “If that is sufficient for them  the outcome in that cohort – survival and other measures like length of time in hospital – will be better than those who had invasive ventilation. That’s largely because they include a less-ill group of patients ” she said. “The group who go on to be intubated  often they’ve had a trial of Cpap which has failed or they’ve deteriorated so rapidly you have no hope of treating them so they have to be intubated. They are sicker patients and their outcome will be poorer.” Cpap is not the only non-invasive ventilation method being tried for Covid-19 patients. It is one of three now included in a trial called Recovery RS  sister to the Recovery trial for new drug treatments for the disease. Mechanical ventilation is not included. Singer said hospitals had to be very careful how they ventilated patients  given the staffing pressures in intensive care units. “I think the general view is that if you can keep a patient off a ventilator  they will do well ” he said. “But it’s catch 22. Sicker patients have sicker lungs.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d201aaf4ff83d1c6f5c74558802e219ffebc1a5/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c45b1ef4992818e7b8906432b1d0cf7a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health%2CHospitals%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/missed-vaccinations-could-lead-to-other-fatal-outbreaks-doctors-warn,society, Missed vaccinations could lead to other fatal outbreaks  doctors warn, GPs worried thousands may delay routine appointments due to fear of catching coronavirus, GPs and accident and emergency departments have witnessed unprecedented falls in the numbers of people seeking medical care in recent weeks  prompting concerns that vital routine immunisations for infections such as measles  mumps  rubella  tetanus and whooping cough are falling by the wayside. “We are very concerned. There are no data yet because we have only been in lockdown for a month  but there are plenty of anecdotes from practice nurses and others saying they have noticed a decline in vaccine uptake ” said Helen Bedford  a professor of children’s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health’s health promotion committee. Similar worries have been borne out in the US  where health records released this week showed MMR (mumps  measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April  with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%. “We’re concerned this is going to have a major impact on immunisations here and also on the routine health checks that new babies have  because people are afraid to go to their general practice or fear general practice isn’t open for business  and it very clearly is ” Bedford said. Ministers and their expert advisers have repeatedly stressed the need for people to stay at home and save lives  but doctors are worried that those who need vaccinations are missing or deferring appointments for fear of either contracting the virus when they go out or adding to the burden on healthcare workers. In mid-March  many GP practices closed their doors and switched to telephone consultations with only a small number of patients receiving face-to-face examinations. Doctors have since reported fewer people coming forward with routine health issues and even potentially serious problems  such as cancer symptoms and poorly controlled diabetes and heart disease. “Childhood immunisations and immunisations for vulnerable older people and people with multiple health problems are an absolute priority for us ” said Prof Martin Marshall  the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners. “Children can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that haven’t gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time  otherwise we really will see a crisis ” he added. In a letter to the Guardian  Marshall warned that it was “essential” for parents to get their children immunised during the Covid-19 epidemic and that a slump in vaccinations risked outbreaks of whooping cough  measles  mumps and rubella in the future. Doctors are particularly worried about children skipping the measles vaccination. Measles is roughly six times more infectious that Covid-19 and can be fatal in some cases. Last year  the UK lost its measles-free status because of a fall in MMR immunisation  meaning that some parts of the country  such as London  are already at high risk of outbreaks. “Measles is massively more infectious than Covid-19 and because it’s so infectious  you only need a small decline in vaccine uptake to start seeing outbreaks ” Bedford said. “The pandemic doesn’t make all the normal diseases go away. They are still circulating  but while we are all in our homes we are protected to a certain extent. It’s when we re-emerge that there is the potential for problems.” She urged new parents to ask their GPs to combine immunisation appointments with routine checks on the mother and baby so that they only need to visit the doctor’s surgery once. The lockdown is having a disproportionate impact on the ability of poorer people to get to appointments  while populations that already have low vaccination rates are expected to become even more vulnerable as their uptake drops further. “The important thing will be finding ways for children to catch up. There will have to be a catch-up process and that might be quite complicated ” Bedford added. Dr Mary Ramsay  the head of immunisations at Public Health England  said: “The national immunisation programme is highly successful in preventing serious and sometimes life-threatening diseases  such as pneumonia  meningitis  whooping cough  diphtheria and measles. During this time  it is important to maintain the best possible vaccine uptake to prevent a resurgence of these infections.” “A vaccine will hopefully conquer Covid-19 and ultimately save lives ” Marshall added. “It would be tragic if a consequence of this pandemic is that we see outbreaks of other deadly diseases for which vaccines already exist.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ccb9169cbb93eddb638a5a4d6a4714ce109b42/0_88_3718_2231/master/3718.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50e8118c3eb622aeb71ec44a18e0610b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Vaccines+and+immunisation%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CSociety%2CScience%2CMedical+research https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/26/uk-military-to-operate-coronavirus-mobile-testing-units-for-frontline-workers,uk-news, UK military to operate coronavirus mobile testing units for frontline workers, Armed forces will collect swabs from people at care homes  police stations and prisons, The units will test essential workers and vulnerable people in areas where there is “significant” demand  the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. The mobile facilities can be set up in less than 20 minutes and allow for hundreds of people to be tested each day. Specially trained members of the armed forces will collect swabs to be sent to labs for processing  with results available within 48 hours  the DHSC said. The government aims to hit its 100 000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. The home secretary  Priti Patel  told the Downing Street daily briefing on Saturday that 28 760 tests were carried on Friday. As of Sunday there are eight mobile units carrying out tests  in areas including Salisbury  Southport and Teesside. The DHSC said at least 96 would be ready to be deployed by the start of May. In a pilot scheme last week  DHSC vehicles were refitted to become testing facilities  based on a design by the army’s Royal Engineers. The armed forces will staff 92 of the units  while civilian contractors will operate a further four located in Northern Ireland  the DHSC said. The mobile sites will also travel to frontline workers in the fire and rescue service and at benefits centres. The defence secretary  Ben Wallace  said: “Our armed forces will help deliver testing to where it’s most needed  using a network of up to 96 mobile units that will be rolled out in the coming weeks. “They will make sure our care sector get the testing required to remain in the front line of the fight against this pandemic.” The national testing coordinator  Prof John Newton  said: “New mobile testing units will help us achieve our goal of 100 000 coronavirus tests a day  providing tests to vital frontline workers wherever they need them. “In a matter of weeks  we have worked with Britain’s leading scientists  academics and industry partners to build scores of new testing facilities and Britain’s largest network of diagnostic labs in history.” More than 10 million key workers and their households are eligible for Covid-19 tests  which can now be booked online through the government’s website. • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK? , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/814f1306a638f241a7d565a4fc7042938b572447/1824_366_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5c91296903a36b8e4d0cec094ff9a52 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health%2CHealth+policy%2CBritish+army%2CMilitary%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-doctors-finding-it-harder-to-get-ppe-kit-to-treat-covid-19-patients-research-reveals,society, UK doctors finding it harder to get PPE kit to treat Covid-19 patients  research reveals, Royal College of Physicians says NHS staff’s lives are still at risk despite ministers’ pledges, The Royal College of Physicians has condemned the apparently worsening availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as “truly terrible” and warned that frontline staff’s lives are at risk as a result. Among doctors performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP)  in which patients with the disease release droplets from their mouth  37% cannot always access a visor to wear while 31% have not been able to obtain a full-length surgical gown. Both are key elements of the full PPE NHS staff are advised to wear when participating in an AGP  such as a patient being intubated before being ventilated. A survey undertaken by the college  to which 2 129 hospital doctors responded last week  found medics are finding it harder generally access to any sort of PPE. Just over a quarter (27%) said they could not get the kit they needed to keep them safe while treating people with Covid-19  up from 22% who said the same when the RCP conducted the same survey at the start of April. “We’re living through the darkest times the NHS has ever faced and this survey shows the reality of the situation facing hospital doctors at the moment”  said Prof Andrew Goddard  the college’s president. “The lack of PPE remains their biggest concern and it is truly terrible that supply has worsened over the past three weeks rather than improved.” In remarks that lay bare leading doctors’ frustration with ministers’ repeated emphasis on the hugely increased amounts of PPE that have reached the frontline in recent weeks  Goddard added: “Healthcare workers couldn’t care less how many billion pieces of PPE have been ordered or supplied. If it isn’t there when they need it  they are in harm’s way.” Dr Matthew Roycroft  the joint chair of the RCP’s trainees committee  hinted that some doctors may decide to withhold treatment amid the PPE shortage. “Without the right PPE my colleagues and I may find ourselves with the most awful of conundrums on our hands – having to choose between protecting our own lives or protecting those of the patients we treat.” Hospital bosses said the college’s findings underlined the need for any future inquiry into the UK’s handling of the pandemic to include the action taken on PPE. Chris Hopson  the chief executive of NHS Providers  which represents health service trusts in England  said: “Trust leaders have told us that  in general  after a difficult start  with the exception of visors and gowns  they now have the PPE they need. “It will be important – when the time comes for a public inquiry – to examine why the pandemic stockpile was not configured for an epidemic like the one we face today and didn’t have enough gowns and visors.” Niall Dickson  his counterpart at the NHS Confederation  said that while the self-selecting nature of the survey meant its findings should be treated with caution  shortages were continuing in some areas  though overall the picture is improving. Priority should now be given to getting PPE to GP surgeries  care homes and community-based health services  Dickson added. Meanwhile  61% of family doctors are no longer seeing a patient unless they have adequate PPE  according to a separate survey  of 675 self-selecting Gps by the medical website Pulse  while 74% said they fear for their health and their life  it emerged. Although many GP appointments are now being conducted by telephone or video link  some patients are still coming into surgeries for a face-to-face consultation. Many GPs have trouble getting hold of face masks  visors or goggles and gowns. Only a third said they had enough masks  for example. Pulse also found that among GPs who responded: The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working night and day to ensure our frontline health and social care staff have the equipment they need to tackle this virus  and have delivered over a billion items of PPE since the outbreak began. “Lord [Paul] Deighton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production scaling up existing manufacturing whilst tapping into new resources. In addition  there is a significant international strategy to ensure that we have the PPE we need.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c4c49df6b31767193aee7fadcb4126e1bd4bf00/0_344_4226_2536/master/4226.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f01dc1beda3458990ddbf77099eef179 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Hospitals%2CGPs%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CHealth%2CScience%2CSociety%2CDoctors https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/church-of-england-launches-free-daily-hope-prayer-hotline,world, Church of England launches free Daily Hope prayer hotline, Service offering hymns and advice is aimed at worshippers with no access to internet, Justin Welby said Daily Hope  available from Sunday  would bring worship and prayer into people’s homes while church buildings are closed because of the coronavirus. “With many in our country on lockdown  it’s important that we support those who are feeling lonely and isolated  whatever age they are ” he said. “The Daily Hope service will allow people to hear hymns  prayers and words that offer comfort and hope  especially in this Easter season.” Thousands of churches have begun streaming services and prayer groups online since the C of E suspended services on 17 March. But according to the Office for National Statistics  in 2019  7.5% of adults had never used the internet  including 2.5 million people aged 75 and above. People calling the 0800 number will hear a greeting from the archbishop and can then choose from a range of options including hymns  prayers  reflections and advice on Covid-19. Carl Knightly  the chief executive of Faith in Later Life  an organisation serving older Christians  said: “We know as an organisation of the challenges for older people in our society in normal times and these are not those  so I want to … get people sharing this number with whoever they know who would most benefit.” Church leaders have reported much higher numbers of people accessing online services and prayer than attend church in normal times. It website allows people to locate churches near them that are livestreaming events  and a national service has been streamed and broadcast on BBC radio each Sunday since the lockdown began. Some prominent Anglicans have argued that churches should remain open  saying locking their doors risks people’s spiritual health.

26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/virologist-christian-drosten-germany-coronavirus-expert-interview,world, Germany's Covid-19 expert: 'For many  I'm the evil guy crippling the economy', Germany’s leading coronavirus expert Christian Drosten on Merkel’s leadership  the UK response and the ‘prevention paradox’, In an exclusive interview  Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders – and why the “prevention paradox” keeps him awake at night. Q: Germany will start to lift its lockdown gradually from Monday. What happens next? A: At the moment  we are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany. This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale  and we stopped the epidemic – that is  we brought the reproduction number [a key measure of the spread of the virus] below 1. Now  what I call the “prevention paradox” has set in. People are claiming we over-reacted  there is political and economic pressure to return to normal. The federal plan is to lift lockdown slightly  but because the German states  or Länder  set their own rules  I fear we’re going to see a lot of creativity in the interpretation of that plan. I worry that the reproduction number will start to climb again  and we will have a second wave. Q: If the lockdown were kept in place longer  could the disease be eradicated? A: There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks  we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree – bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven’t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average  an indication. It doesn’t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens’ homes  where it will take longer to eradicate the disease  and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended. Q: If there were such a resurgence  could it be contained? A: Yes  but it can’t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms – and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they’ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible – and that will require electronic contact-tracing. Q: How close we are to achieving herd immunity? A: To achieve herd immunity we need 60-70% of the population to carry antibodies to the virus. The results of antibody tests suggest that in Europe and the US  in general  we are in the low single digits  but the tests are not reliable – all of them have problems with false positives – and herd immunity is also not the whole story. It assumes complete mixing of the population  but there are reasons – in part to do with the social networks people form – why the whole population may not be available for infection at any given time. Networks shift  and new people are exposed to the virus. Such effects can drive waves of infection. Another factor that could impact herd immunity is whether other coronaviruses – those that cause the common cold  for example – offer protection to this one. We don’t know  but it’s possible. Q: Should all countries be testing everybody? A: I’m not sure. Even in Germany  with our huge testing capacity  and most of it directed to people reporting symptoms  we have not had a positivity rate above 8%. So I think targeted testing might be best  for people who are really vulnerable – staff in hospitals and care homes  for example. This is not fully in place even in Germany  though we’re moving towards it. The other target should be patients in the first week of symptoms  especially elderly patients who tend to come to hospital too late at the moment – when their lips are already blue and they need intubation. And we need some kind of sentinel surveillance system  to sample the population regularly and follow the development of the reproduction number. Q: What is known about the seasonality of the virus? A: Not a lot. The Harvard modelling group led by Marc Lipsitch has suggested that transmission might slow over the summer  but that it will be a small effect. I don’t have better data. Q: Can we say for sure that the pandemic started in China? I think so. On the other hand  I don’t assume that it started at the food market in Wuhan. It is more likely to have started where the animal – the intermediate host – was bred. Q: What do we know about that intermediate host – is it the “poor pangolin”  as it’s come to be known? A: I don’t see any reason to assume that the virus passed through pangolins on its way to humans. There is an interesting piece of information from the old Sars literature. That virus was found in civet cats  but also in raccoon dogs – something the media overlooked. Raccoon dogs are a massive industry in China  where they are bred on farms and caught in the wild for their fur. If somebody gave me a few hundred thousand bucks and free access to China to find the source of the virus  I would look in places where raccoon dogs are bred. Q: Will it be useful to identify patient zero – the first human to have been infected with this virus? A: No. Patient zero is almost certain to have acquired a virus that is very similar to some of the first sequenced viruses  so it wouldn’t help us solve our current problem. I don’t think you could even argue that it would help us prevent future coronavirus pandemics  because humanity will be immune to the next Sars-related coronavirus  having been exposed to this one. Other coronaviruses could pose a threat – a prime candidate is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) virus – but to understand that threat we have to study how Mers viruses are evolving in camels in the Middle East. Q: Are human activities responsible for the spillover of coronaviruses from animals into people? Coronaviruses are prone to switch hosts when there is opportunity  and we create such opportunities through our non-natural use of animals – livestock. Livestock animals are exposed to wildlife  they are kept in large groups that can amplify the virus  and humans have intense contact with them – for example through the consumption of meat – so they certainly represent a possible trajectory of emergence for coronaviruses. Camels count as livestock in the Middle East  and they are the host of the Mers virus as well as human coronavirus 229E – which is one cause of the common cold – while cattle were the original hosts for coronavirus OC43  which is another. Q: Flu has always been thought to pose the greatest pandemic risk. Is that still the case? A: Certainly  but we can’t rule out another coronavirus pandemic. After the first Ebola outbreak  in 1976  people thought it would never come back again  but it took less than 20 years to do so. Q: Is all the science being done around this coronavirus good science? A: No! Early on  in February  there were many interesting preprints [scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed] around. Now you can read through 50 before you find something that’s actually solid and interesting. A lot of research resources are being wasted. Q: Angela Merkel has been praised for her leadership during this crisis. What makes her a good leader? She’s extremely well-informed. It helps that she’s a scientist and can handle numbers. But I think it mainly comes down to her character – her thoughtfulness and ability to reassure. Maybe one of the distinguishing features of a good leader is that they are not using this present situation as a political opportunity. They know how counterproductive that would be. Q: From where you stand  how is the UK handling the situation? A: It’s clear that testing was implemented a little bit too late in the UK. Public Health England was in a position to diagnose the disease very early on – we worked with them to make the diagnostic test – but rollout in Germany was driven in part by market forces  which made it fast  and that wasn’t the case in the UK. Now  though  I have the impression that the UK is really gaining momentum in this regard  and that it is coordinating testing efforts better than Germany. Q: What keeps you awake at night? A: In Germany  people see that the hospitals are not overwhelmed  and they don’t understand why their shops have to shut. They only look at what’s happening here  not at the situation in  say  New York or Spain. This is the prevention paradox  and for many Germans I’m the evil guy who is crippling the economy. I get death threats  which I pass on to the police. More worrying to me are the other emails  the ones from people who say they have three kids and they’re worried about the future. It’s not my fault  but those ones keep me awake at night. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3c3ecc7bc090ce60be5df12507c3e07c68b52c/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4e6db14e6951861637e3d2ffd42f377 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CEurope%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CScience%2CEpidemics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/kim-jong-uns-train-possibly-spotted-at-north-korean-resort,world, Kim Jong-un's train possibly spotted at North Korean resort, As rumours persist that ruler is in poor health  satellite images emerge showing train parked at Wonsan’s ‘leadership station’, Images reviewed by 38 North  a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38  showed that the train had been parked at the “leadership station” in Wonsan since at least 21 April. Citing an analysis of recent satellite photos of the area  38 North said the 250m-long train was not present on 15 April but was seen on both 21 and 23 April. The site said the train appeared to have been repositioned for departure on the latter date  but added that there had been no indication of when it might leave. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family  it added. “The train’s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country’s eastern coast ” the 38 North report said. Speculation about Kim’s health grew quickly following his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s grandfather  Kim Il-sung  on 15 April. On Saturday  Kim missed another national holiday  North Korea’s Military Foundation Day  further fuelling speculation about his health. According to a report in Newsweek  US intelligence has seen no sign of unusual military activity in the country but are continuing to monitor the situation closely. Newsweek quoted a senior unnamed Pentagon official as saying: “We have observed no indications or received any additional information to make a conclusive assessment on the status of North Korean leadership or health of Kim Jong-un.” But the official went on to say the presence of the train in Wonsan and Kim’s absence from recent events lent credibility to reports that he was ill. Kim’s status meant North Korea could conceivably delay announcing his death to ensure security measures were in place  the official said. North Korea’s state media last reported on Kim’s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting of the ruling party’s politburo on 11 April. On Friday  Reuters reported that had China dispatched a team of medical experts and officials to North Korea to advise on Kim. South Korea’s government has dismissed reports that Kim is seriously ill  saying last week that he appeared to be handling state affairs normally and that there had been no suspicious activities  such as an emergency readiness order issued by the North’s military or the ruling Workers’ party. Some South Korean media outlets  citing unidentified government officials  have reported that Kim was staying at Wonsan  located about 200km east of the capital  Pyongyang. The broadcaster TBS said last Thursday that Kim had been in the resort for the previous four days and would soon make a reappearance. North Korea’s state media has not commented on Kim’s health or offered clues as to his whereabouts. On Sunday  state radio said he had sent a message of thanks to building workers in a northern border town but did not say when or offer any other details  according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Kim’s two-week absence from public life has sparked speculation among North Korean defectors living in the South. According to the Korea Times  Ji Seong-ho  a defector who won a seat in last week’s national assembly elections in the South  claimed a source inside North Korea had confirmed to him that Kim was “seriously ill” and that the country was in the grip of a succession struggle. But Thae Yong-ho  the most senior North Korean diplomat to have defected  said it was impossible to speculate about the state of Kim’s health. Thae  a former North Korean deputy ambassador to the UK who also won a national assembly seat  said: “The supreme leader’s whereabouts are protected with intense secrecy  so very few people know these details. Considering the gravity of the situation  it is impossible for news of his poor health to spread to the border with China.” Kim  who came to power after the death in 2011 of his father  Kim Jong-il  has no clear successor  and a prolonged power vacuum is certain to raise international concerns about the security of the country’s nuclear arsenal. Kim’s younger sister  Kim Yo-jong  has recently emerged as a powerful force within the regime  while other possible candidates include premier Kim Jae-ryong  who conducted a number of site visits around the country on Friday. Donald Trump has played down reports that Kim is ill. “I think the report was incorrect ” Trump told reporters on Friday  but declined to say if he had been in contact with North Korean officials. Trump has met his “friend” Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to abandon his nuclear weapons. Under Kim  North Korea has developed missiles capable of reaching the US mainland  but denuclearisation talks remain deadlocked. Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said days of North Korean media silence on Kim’s whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition. On Monday  Daily NK  a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea  cited one unnamed source in North Korea as saying that Kim had undergone heart surgery in the resort county of Hyangsan  north of Pyongyang  on 12 April. Kim  believed to be 36  has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014  he vanished for more than a month amid rumours about his heath. North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about Kim’s health has been fuelled by his heavy smoking and weight gain since taking power. His family also has a history of cardiovascular problems. If Kim Jong-un dies or is incapacitated  the North Korean regime would have little time to prepare for a smooth transition of power. But who might replace him? Kim Yo-jong The most obvious candidate is Kim’s younger sister  Kim Yo-jong  who has been his most trusted confidante over the past year  accompanying him to nuclear summits and advising him on his image  both at home and during his diplomatic engagement with the US and South Korea. Yo-jong would become the fourth generation of her family to rule North Korea  part of a powerful cult of personality built around the family’s mythical Mount Paektu bloodline – a reference to the country’s highest  and most revered  mountain. But some experts have said military and party elites could oppose the appointment of a woman as supreme leader  given the country’s strong patriarchal principles. Choe Ryong-hae An alternative scenario would be a collective leadership  possibly with Yo-jong as a figurehead at the outset  but stripped of the absolute power enjoyed by her brother  father and grandfather. A collective leadership would most likely be led by Choe Ryong-hae  North Korea’s ceremonial head of state and the country’s official second-in-command. Choe  however  is not a member of the Kim family  so his elevation could prompt questions over his legitimacy and trigger a power struggle  plunging the country into chaos. Kim Pyong-il Another candidate is Kim Pyong-il  Kim Jong-il’s 65-year-old half-brother  who spent decades in Europe as a diplomat and whose age and experience could make him more acceptable to other senior officials. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ea25d4e4abacb1299731119ac80ac2cb3c3a86/0_270_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bca8596b5347afa5b1a928d9545e105 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e450903d514988f181f382e5ae300796a35170d/0_259_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29aa69408ba243daba59fa4a085c14a5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857b36e24d7981e36d969cb6ff32e0809c2a639a/0_198_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c844d073afd89e3c7e0917592cae9d8b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c200fb3780897a0a5ff7de97618fe42aeeaab600/0_373_7360_4416/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c2486a52e9113e051d36b0b2c98c3241 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47681622fa58330a3d8fde28d26a6d69ada2c729/0_198_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30bc5d9e95d9192f1be61f347db7bfca https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6c2b3af1227e1c24882cf57885543ca8b7c7439/613_329_1246_748/master/1246.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f5f868faca3b7a20bcf0818c8f02b033 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Kim+Jong-un%2CNorth+Korea%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/france-italy-spain-prepare-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdowns,world, France  Italy and Spain prepare to ease coronavirus lockdowns, Several other EU countries have already announced a tentative easing of restrictions, After the US  where the number of infections is heading towards the 1m mark  with more than 53 000 deaths  the three countries have the highest numbers of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world  according to Johns Hopkins University. The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic passed 200 000 on Saturday  with more than 2.9m confirmed cases  rising rapidly in many countries but slowing in others because of lockdowns. Decisions on how and when to reopen will be vital to how people and businesses can cope with the pandemic  balancing the need for economies to restart with the risks of new outbreaks and further shutdowns. In Italy  which was the first European country to impose a lockdown in March  and where there have so far been close to 200 000 infections and at least 26 384 deaths  Giuseppe Conte said manufacturing could restart as soon as 4 May. The Italian prime minister said schools  however  would not reopen until September. Measures would be announced early this week  he told Italian daily La Repubblica. Tight lockdowns have been seen as a blunt but effective tool to halt infections until a vaccine is developed. Some countries have imposed less restrictive measures  for example Sweden  where shops  restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Possibly as a result  Sweden’s death rate from Covid-19 is nearly 200 per million people  compared with 31 per million in neighbouring Finland and 36 per million in Norway. The country’s chief epidemiologist  Anders Tegnell  has argued that the effectiveness of lockdowns and border closures has not yet been properly analysed and that Sweden’s high infection rate might help it in the future as more people will become immune. However  Sweden’s deputy prime minister  Isabella Lövin  told the BBC it was not yet fully clear if people who had been infected would be immune. She also said the country had a “big problem” with its main strategy after outbreaks in elderly care homes. There was debate at the weekend on the topic of immunity after the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no evidence that people who had recovered were immune. After criticism from scientists  the agency rowed back  clarifying that it expected people to develop some level of protection but that it was not clear how much and how long it would last. Unlike Sweden  France has imposed a mandatory tight lockdown for weeks. The country’s prime minister  Édouard Philippe  said he would present a national exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday  which would then debate and vote on the recommendations. The pandemic has killed at least 22 614 people in France  with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours. Seventeen priorities have been identified for bringing France out of lockdown. These include reopening schools  companies returning to work  getting public transport back to normal  the supply of masks and sanitiser  testing policy and support for elderly people. In Spain  health authorities have also begun to outline plans for a move towards “a new normality” as the number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. As of Sunday  children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March  and the prime minister  Pedro Sánchez  announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend. Speaking on Sunday  Fernando Simón  the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies  said recent figures showed a “clear descending trend”. The government’s decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs a fortnight ago had not had any negative impact so far  he said. Spain has confirmed a total of 207 634 cases and recorded 23 190 deaths  its health ministry reported. The growth rate of new cases stands at 0.8% – down from 3% in recent weeks and 38% when the state of emergency was declared on 14 March. Several other European countries  including Belgium  Greece and Malta  have already announced a tentative easing of restrictions. Elsewhere  there has been pressure to lift the lockdown. In Jerusalem  Israeli police clashed with merchants at a fruit and vegetable market that was prevented from reopening on Sunday while other highstreets shops were. In Berlin  dozens of protesters were arrested on Saturday for a demonstration against the lockdown. However  Hong Kong’s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon  saying “you need a sledgehammer” to bring down the rate of infections first. Worldwide  a lack of testing and discrepancies in reporting from country to country make it impossible to fully track where and how the virus is spreading. In Africa  the crisis appeared to be just beginning. A sudden rise of more than 40% in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases during the last 10 days across the continent – to 30 300 – and a similar increase in the number of deaths – to 1 374 – has worried specialists. The WHO has warned of 10 million cases in Africa within three to six months  though experts say that the death toll could be lower if authorities can move swiftly to contain outbreaks of the disease. “We are at the beginning in Africa ” Mike Ryan  executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme  said last week. South and Central America  by contrast  are already deep in crisis  with Brazil emerging as a significant epidemic hotspot. Cases of Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals  morgues and cemeteries  even as President Jair Bolsonaro insists it is a relatively minor disease. Other developments around the world include: , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d35c832603d43097c27747e6029beff36105bf/0_218_6550_3930/master/6550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=750a8643f9c63c976b554120d30ea26f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CFrance%2CItaly%2CSpain%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks,world, Birx declines to criticise Trump and warns distancing will last months, , Birx made a number of appearances on the Sunday morning TV news shows  where she was asked about Trump’s outlandish comments made at a White House briefing on Thursday  which prompted immediate backlash from medical experts and industrial manufacturers who cited the potentially fatal outcome of such a process. Trump has falsely claimed the comments were sarcastic. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union  Birx was asked if she was bothered by the fallout from the president’s remarks. “It bothers me that this is still in the news cycle  because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people to continue to protect one another ” Birx said. “As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher  sometimes I worry that we don’t get the information to the American people that they need when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night.” In a later appearance on NBC News  Birx also responded to a suggestion from the vice-president  Mike Pence  in which he claimed that the US would “largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us” by Memorial Day  on 25 May. Birx said that while downward trends in infections and deaths in certain locations such as Houston and Detroit “gives us great hope”  she said “social distancing will be with us through the summer”. She added that the US required a “breakthrough innovation in testing” to speed up the reopening  by testing for those who have already had coronavirus but displayed little to no symptoms  in order to track the virus’s spread. The comments came as New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some less affected regions of the state could partially re-open when his statewide shelter in place order expires on 15 May. New York  the worst hit state in America  reported a drop in the number of deaths again on Sunday. Meanwhile  Georgia’s governor  the Republican Brian Kemp  has partially lifted social distancing guidelines  meaning restaurants will be allowed to reopen to the public on Monday with other businesses  including gyms and salons already allowed to re-open. The order has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans because of the state’s increasing infection rate and lack of testing. Birx’s cautious wording underlined the difficulties faced by health experts working for the administration throughout the pandemic  who have attempted to balance sound scientific advice without directly contradicting haphazard and sometimes dangerous political rhetoric from political figures  including the president. Trump’s promotion of injected disinfectant was only the latest example of reckless promotion of unfounded or potentially harmful medical advice during the pandemic. The president had previously touted an unproven antimalarial drug  hydroxychloroquine  which the FDA has now ruled cannot be used outside of clinical trials or a hospital settings because of its potential cardiac risks. On Sunday  Dr Birx told CNN she had “made it clear” to Trump that injected disinfectant “was not a treatment”  but added the president’s advocacy on the issue should be viewed as a “kind of dialogue will happen” between scientists and politicians. Although Trump has not specified where the idea of using injected disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from  the Guardian revealed on Friday that a prominent group peddling the use of bleach as a “miracle cure” had written to the president earlier in the week. Trump had also pushed the potential use of ultraviolet light on the body as a treatment for coronavirus  pushing research by the Department of Homeland Security exploring how heat and sunlight affect the virus on surfaces. Experts have also long cautioned against the dangerous  potentially lethal side effects of UV light on the human body. On Sunday  Birx also sought to distance herself from the president’s suggestion  and instead cited research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that suggested sunlight can affect the aerosolization of the virus outdoors. The back-and-forth comes as senior state Republicans showed signs of being more forceful in their criticism of Trump’s wild claims. Larry Hogan  the Republican governor of Maryland  told ABC News on Sunday that the state received “hundreds of calls come into our emergency hotline at our health department asking if it was right to ingest Clorox or alcohol cleaning products – whether that was going to help them fight the virus”. The calls forced the governor to issue a warning against doing so. “I think when misinformation comes out or you just say something that pops in your head  it does send a wrong message ” Hogan added  with reference to Trump’s press conferences. Trump indicated over the weekend he could halt the daily press briefings that have underpinned his shambolic response to the pandemic  drawing widespread criticism for their similarity to campaign rallies rather than public health briefings. “What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions  & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately ” he tweeted on Saturday at roughly the same time in the evening that the briefing would have taken place. “They get record ratings  & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!” There were no reports of a White House briefing on Sunday by the late afternoon. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd51dfe148fec5769442f81f101a03d26df52628/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00ae0c5568ee062458a4721a8c3ca268 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acb060bb9fd5654d192a280c9eec4c7c8a523ff/0_40_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46e7cfd6549f890ac77d642bff37ea60 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1301d7b23ac0ace5e0f4fb75ac535e9cb20ab8/0_32_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c06e13fbba60b4732a34a39321a99c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9f5b1473a9ae9e4cd4b1d3b405f56b5392bf10/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=928dd5039fba60b0a5086580c8f37f12 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDonald+Trump%2CTrump+administration%2CUS+politics%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/france-public-support-for-strict-coronavirus-lockdown-drops-below-50-percent,world, France: public support for strict lockdown drops below 50%, Poll shows fall in support for confinement as country prepares to slowly lift some measures, The French government will announce details of its plan to slowly ease restrictions across the country from 11 May  including the phased reopening of schools  on Tuesday. The proposals will be introduced to the Assemblée Nationale and put to a vote of MPs. A survey published this weekend showed that less than half the population – 43% – now supports the maintaining of strict “confinement” measures  down eight percentage points from the previous week. However  if the confinement ends  82% want the government to make free masks available to the general population. The poll by YouGov for the Huffington Post showed more than three quarters of French people support the continued ban on sporting and cultural events and almost as many say workers should be urged to work from home if they can. The reopening of schools remains divisive  with teachers concerned that they are being used as part of attempts to widen public immunity to the virus. The government’s scientific committee has suggested school reopenings should be carried out in a “progressive and careful” way. However  in an earlier report the committee suggested “the risk of spread [of Covid-19] is greater in places of large gatherings like schools and universities  with it being particularly difficult to put in place barrier measures among the youngest pupils”. It suggested keeping nurseries  schools  lycées and universities shut until September  in direct contradiction to President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to open nurseries and schools but not higher education establishments. Last week  the country’s Academy of Medicine issued its recommendations for the return to school  insisting teachers should be given training in how to ensure pupils respect health measures. It advised having hand gel in all school lavatories  classrooms and entrances  with classrooms  canteens and common areas  particularly staircases and door handles  disinfected several times a day. The academy also advised that pupils should have their temperature taken before entering the school. Those living in cities who use public transport to reach work and schools are also worried about how social distancing measures will be maintained if they are expected back at their jobs. It has been suggested the government will make wearing masks on public transport obligatory  but it has failed to explain where the masks will come from or how they will be distributed. France’s Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) reported an internal note from the junior economy minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher  which stated: “The national weekly production and imports [of masks] is still not enough at this stage to fully cover the need”. The note suggested there may be enough masks by 18 May  one week after the end of lockdown begins. An Ifop opinion poll for the JDD showed confidence in the government’s handling of the health crisis  that reached a high of 55% in March  had dropped to 39%. Frédéric Dabi  Ifop’s director  said Macron’s national address on 13 April had brought a boost in popularity but since then “concern about the return to school and the summer holidays have worsened”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464226f060837010597fccfcc12e5510a6c84070/0_330_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03b3b75c4fdda3f086cb4c257000a364 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=France%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/26/joe-biden-running-mate-vice-president-democrats,us-news, Biden searches for his own 'Biden' – a running mate with chemistry, Biden has taken an unusual approach  gamely answering questions about his search for a vice-president – a role he knows intimately, His approach is unusual. The process of selecting a running mate is typically shrouded in deep secrecy. But  as Biden likes to remind voters  it’s a role he knows intimately. Having served two terms as Barack Obama’s vice-president  this is a decision he believes will shape not only his campaign  but also his presidency. “The first and most important quality is someone who  if I were to walk away immediately from the office for whatever reason  that they can be president and the public could look at that person and say: ‘She is capable of being president of the United States tomorrow ’” Biden said last week in an appearance on CBS’s The Late Late Show with James Corden. Though Biden is still in the early stages of the selection process – he insists he’s months away from making a final decision – his public dialogue has provided real-time insight into what past nominees have christened their “first presidential act”. The decision – typically the result of an extensive vetting process that takes into account biography and geography  personal chemistry and governing experience – has been further complicated by the coronavirus pandemic  which has decimated the economy and killed more than 53 000 Americans. “By then  we will likely be in some form of economic crisis or recovery and the vice-president will be Joe Biden’s partner in charting a path forward for the county ” said Karen Finney  a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Breaking with precedent  Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate. There is a strong political argument for putting a woman on the ticket. Women are among Donald Trump’s most vocal opponents. A CNN poll this month found Biden leading the president by 30 percentage points among women. And during his presidency  Democratic women have voted  organized and run for office in historic numbers. Biden’s pledge to choose a woman also reflects a frustration that the most diverse field of presidential candidates in American history yielded a 77-year-old white man as its nominee. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 41% of Democratic registered voters say they are bothered that the likely Democratic nominee for the 2020 election is a “white man in his 70s”. Biden has acknowledged his age is a factor. He would be the oldest president ever inaugurated  at 78  and has said he will choose a younger running mate. Stressing the importance of governing experience and leadership  Biden has also said he wants someone who is prepared to step into the presidency on “Day One” in the event that his health deteriorates or  in his words  “lightning strikes and I die”. He plans to announce an advisory panel to oversee his search by 1 May. That team will likely narrow the pool to between two and five candidates  he has said. Though Biden has been coy about his preferences  he has been consistent in his requirement that his running mate be someone he “completely trusts” to carry out his agenda yet is unafraid to challenge him on major decisions. In an interview last week  Biden told a Pittsburgh radio station that he would select Michelle Obama as his running mate “in a heartbeat” but suspected that she has no “desire to live near the White House again”. Among those repeatedly mentioned as possibilities are his former rivals: Senators Kamala Harris of California  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Also rumored to be in contention are Michigan’s governor  Gretchen Whitmer  who Biden said “made my list” months before she became a prominent national leader confronting the coronavirus  and Stacey Abrams  the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia. Biden is facing intensifying pressure  including from some of his most prominent allies  to choose a woman of color. There is a particularly strong push for him to choose a black woman to energize African American voters in November and demonstrate that the party does not take for granted its most reliable constituency. The South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn  whose endorsement ahead of the state’s primary revived Biden’s lagging campaign  has encouraged him to choose an African American woman  even supplying a list of possible candidates  among them Atlanta’s mayor  Keisha Lance Bottoms. Abrams  who has been remarkably forward about her interest in the job  said recently she would have “concerns” if Biden didn’t choose a woman of color to be his running mate. But Biden is also heeding calls from the left wing of the party to select a more liberal running mate  like Warren  who they believe would help him appeal to progressives and younger voters skeptical of his candidacy. Still others believe he should choose a candidate with roots in the industrial Midwest  a region critically important to winning the Electoral College. Yet there is little evidence to support the conventional wisdom that vice-presidential candidates influence general election outcomes in a significant way. Selecting a female running mate did not affect how women voted in 2008  when the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin was the vice-presidential nominee  according to an analysis by Chris Devine of the University of Dayton and Kyle Kopko of Elizabethtown College  authors of Do Running Mates Matter? Similarly  their research found that Mike Pence did not make conservatives or evangelical Christians any more likely to vote for Trump in 2016. Still  a candidate’s choice of running mate does matter  said Devine  by “shaping perceptions of the presidential nominee”. He pointed to 2008  when Obama  then a young  first-term Illinois senator  faced John McCain  the senior Arizona senator and war hero. “Obama increased perceptions of his readiness to be president by picking Joe Biden whereas McCain hurt himself by picking Sarah Palin ” Devine said  adding: “You can really hurt yourself as a presidential candidate by picking someone who is not clearly qualified.” Stephanie Cutter  a Democratic strategist who worked on John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004  emphasized the importance of personal chemistry. She recalled Kerry’s decision to pick North Carolina senator John Edwards over Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt. Kerry liked Gephardt but he worried the congressman would not excite voters – and that he was unlikely to carry his home state. “In the end you could tell there was no chemistry ” Cutter said. “That mattered to the performance of the ticket. And I don’t think that’s lost on Biden because he did have that chemistry with Barack Obama.” In Biden’s search for his own “Biden”  he has repeatedly cited his close relationship with Obama as a model. The governing partnership between Obama and Biden was a “marriage made in political heaven”  said Jules Witcover  a historian who has written extensively about the vice-presidency and is the author of the biography Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption. “Instead of creating a record for himself  Biden devoted himself to supporting the agenda of President Obama ” he said. “In return  Obama made him as full a governing partner as possible.” Witcover noted that Obama charged Biden with overseeing the administration’s 2009 effort to rescue the country from what was then the largest economic collapse since the Great Depression. Biden believes the scale of the economic crisis he may inherit in January 2021 could rival what Franklin Roosevelt faced in 1933. As such  he has made clear that he is looking for a running mate whom he can trust to carry out major pieces of his presidential agenda. “You’ve got to be able to turn and say to your vice-president: ‘This is your responsibility ’” Biden said last year. “Because the job is too big any more for any one man or woman.” , https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/463460171768f1a03cb4d6fbc8db8956/us-elections-2020.svg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Lauren-Gambino,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0804d4b8c04642e4e30f7078570e5234 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e08f888c1908d038596c90c4d0e0ad10eb891c0/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=461c17c455180a2e0ced9d87ff47cc5b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9a2d8b5025caede0d0cd61d9fb5b81cd8a7d81/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=699fc3925aee16aec515cb5ecec60e4e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226efd20d819a0d13747a3c8745f0016d6ebc7f2/0_246_3901_2341/master/3901.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3af6611a52a01bf1c238dd5793ea4831 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef098cc98c4ba510d3dc80f91f6acec7f5e16fa2/0_82_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff43deaa9b2371a10aa8e6085aaf3231 https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/463460171768f1a03cb4d6fbc8db8956/us-elections-2020.svg https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Joe+Biden%2CUS+elections+2020%2CDemocrats%2CUS+politics%2CBarack+Obama%2CUS+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/26/donald-trump-xenophobia-re-election-campaign-2020,us-news, Donald Trump set to fall back on xenophobia with re-election plan in tatters, The president had been intending to campaign on a strong economy and facing a socialist opponent but scapegoating foreigners has worked for him beforeby David Smith in Washington, Trump this week announced in a late-night tweet that he would “temporarily suspend immigration” into America. Two days later  when he signed an executive order  it only applied to people seeking green cards to move to the country permanently  not to temporary workers  and there were plenty of loopholes. But by then the headlines had been written  the outrage expressed and the objective achieved: Trump was cracking down on immigration again because  he claimed  he was putting America and its workers first. The exercise was arguably less about policy than politics. A nativist  populist message helped him win the presidency in 2016. He tried it again in the 2018 midterm elections for Congress with mixed results. Now  with his handling of a deadly pandemic under scrutiny and the economy in freefall  critics say he is ready to bet the White House on his ability to stir nationalist and racist sentiment with little subtlety. “This is a president who doesn’t use the dog whistle of Republicans in the past  and even Democrats in the past who used dog whistle politics to talk about race in code ” said Juan Cartagena  president and general counsel of Latino Justice  a civil rights organisation. “This guy talks about it openly. Under normal circumstances he would have been a one-term president  but his base is pretty loyal and we’re still talking about a country that barely comes out in large turnout numbers.” Apart from antipathy towards globalised trade  Trump is said to be a man of few core political beliefs and little ideology. But when he descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York in June 2015 to declare his long-shot candidacy for president  he started as he meant to go on. Mexico  he complained  was not sending its best people across the border. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” Trump also announced his signature issue: “I would build a great wall  and nobody builds walls better than me  believe me  and I’ll build them very inexpensively  I will build a great  great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.” There followed an incendiary  taboo-busting election campaign in which “Build that wall!” became a familiar chant at Trump rallies  where he railed against the presidency of Barack Obama and threw red meat to his base. He lashed out at a judge of Mexican ancestry and a Muslim whose son died fighting for the US in Iraq. He threatened to ban Muslims from the country. He promised “America first”. And he won. Two years later  campaigning on behalf of senators and representatives  Trump used rallies to stoke fears that “caravans” of undocumented immigrants from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador were set to pour into the US from Mexico. To the frustration of Republicans who wanted him to focus on economic achievements  he used vivid language to demonise criminal gangs and human traffickers and put victims’ families on public display. This time  the strategy was only partially successful: Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate but lost 40 seats in the House of Representatives  where the new Democratic majority went on to impeach Trump. Early in 2020  the Trump re-election campaign appeared to be built on firm foundations. There were economic talking points – unemployment at its lowest for half a century  the stock market at record highs – even if it did not always feel that way on the ground. Meanwhile  Senator Bernie Sanders  a democratic socialist  was leading the Democratic presidential primary race  prompting Trump and allies to warn darkly of the radical left. These scripts have been torn up. The coronavirus pandemic has killed about 50 000 Americans and is likely to surpass US losses in the entire Vietnam war. Since the outbreak also put the economy into a coma: at least 26 million people have requested unemployment benefits  wiping out all the job gains since the great recession of 2008. Rick Wilson  a political strategist and author of Running Against the Devil  an analysis of how the 2020 election could play out  said: “The predicates of Donald Trump’s campaign were fundamentally: ‘The economy is great and I made the economy great and also  by the way  this is my great economy. Have you noticed my great economy?’ That’s gone. If you claim you have sole control and credit for something  then when it goes wrong  the shoe gets placed on the other foot rather quickly  and it has.” In the Democratic primary  meanwhile  Sanders quickly fell away against former vice-president Joe Biden  a moderate who served under Obama and will be much harder to caricature as a socialist menace. Short of ammunition  his record in tatters  Trump can still fall back on the politics of division and made-for-TV partisan outrage. His daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings have become a substitute for campaign rallies and regularly include progress reports on the border wall. The executive order on immigration  probably bearing the fingerprints of senior adviser Stephen Miller  was billed as a way to ensure that American workers take priority over foreigners in any economic recovery. It has struck a chord with some of Trump’s supporters. Douglas Collins  86  a neurologist from Pensacola  Florida  said: “We’ve got to get the economy up and running  and people who live pay cheque to pay cheque and are American have to be the first consideration. Is prejudice a major factor? I don’t think so.” Doug Peltier  69  from Forest Lake  Minnesota  said: “It’s a valid position to be concerned about the economy and immigrants coming and taking jobs from Americans. I’m not a bigot  I’m not against immigrants  I have a great deal of respect for Mexicans and blacks. I do believe Americans should come first. I guess you could call me a nationalist.” Peltier  a retired school administrator who attended a Trump rally in Minneapolis last year  added: “I think Trump has more support than a lot of people believe. We don’t boast; we tend to be more silent. I would never put a Donald Trump sticker on my car because I know it would get keyed.” But opponents see something else: a president whose world collapsed around him  suddenly flailing in strange surroundings and grabbing on to a familiar lifeline. Wilson  the political strategist  argues that bigotry  hatred and prejudice “aren’t a bug of the Trump program – those are a feature. “He will pursue what he looks at as something that was highly effective for him in the last campaign and that is a racially and ethnically inflected campaign that tries to tell Republican voters in particular that all of their problems and concerns and issues come from the brown people.” Already Trump and Republican allies have hardened their line on China  fuelling a theory that the coronavirus might have accidentally escaped a laboratory in Wuhan and condemning the country for not raising the alarm earlier. They hope to couple this with an attack on Biden  dubbing him “Beijing Biden” and claiming he had a cosy relationship with China in the past. Wilson  who is co-founder of the Lincoln Project  a political action committee aiming to prevent Trump’s re-election  added: “What you will absolutely see this fall is that Donald Trump will come out and he will make up a story and it will be something like  ‘There’s boats full of diseased Chinamen coming our way  bar the door’.” Democrats are braced for another bitter fight with a president who looks certain to lose the popular vote again but hopes to squeeze by in a few battleground states that decide the electoral college. Neil Sroka  communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America  added: “What we should expect in 2020 is  because of the economic implosion  because of his massive mishandling of this crisis  he will pursue a xenophobic campaign that makes the 2016 effort look like patty cake.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e31016d4367905d392d28bd361db1ac472aaf19/171_190_3973_2384/master/3973.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0dc3e2286c4782c68dc7763bc0977c0 https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/463460171768f1a03cb4d6fbc8db8956/us-elections-2020.svg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02410c96aea09ef0a64850c5724878480967179/0_0_4096_3013/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3d2ed06c308863c9f76af1da60eef625 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a374eeb032faf58a21faa62385527a274a7941/0_0_4908_3272/master/4908.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41a1846a51a82e38f2cfe695ab3e4691 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128a2e1979e433e06ff98c70f5151452e08c458e/0_0_4368_2912/master/4368.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d289068e2513ec5dcc850a995040ba2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ac168e384b42e7f97ac452c835ad9fad8ad9a3d/0_0_5360_3712/master/5360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee15aa8a5da353ccce347c871bdfc3fd https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/463460171768f1a03cb4d6fbc8db8956/us-elections-2020.svg https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Donald+Trump%2CUS+news%2CUS+elections+2020%2CUS+politics%2CRepublicans%2CRace https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/bolsonaro-in-fresh-crisis-over-sons-alleged-links-to-fake-news-racket,world, Bolsonaro in fresh crisis over son's alleged links to fake news racket, Claims risk damaging Brazilian president already reeling from resignation of justice minister, One of Brazil’s top newspapers  the Folha de São Paulo  claimed an investigation by Brazil’s equivalent to the FBI had homed in on Carlos Bolsonaro  the president’s social-media-savvy son. Carlos Bolsonaro  37  rejected the claims as “garbage” and “a joke” on Twitter  where he has 1.7 million followers. But the allegations will deepen the crisis consuming Bolsonaro’s 16-month-old government and further distract from the country’s efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic  which has killed more than 4 000 Brazilians. Bolsonaro’s administration was already floundering before the recent resignation of his powerful justice minister  Sergio Moro  with another of the president’s sons  Flávio Bolsonaro  facing police scrutiny for suspected corruption and ties to Rio de Janeiro’s mafia. Bolsonaro’s dismissive reaction to the coronavirus crisis has sparked outrage across the political spectrum and pot-banging protests. The latest political melodrama exploded on Friday when Moro resigned and publicly accused the president of attempting to improperly meddle in the operations of the federal police by sacking the federal police director  Maurício Valeixo  that morning. Moro alleged that Bolsonaro  for reasons that remain unclear  hoped to replace Valeixo with someone more amenable to discussing federal police business and sharing intelligence reports with the president. The man widely touted as Valeixo’s successor is Alexandre Ramagem  the head of Brazil’s intelligence agency  who is reportedly a friend of Carlos Bolsonaro’s. A photograph of Ramagem and Carlos Bolsonaro fraternising at a New Year’s Eve party was published by Brazilian media on Saturday. The Folha de São Paulo claimed federal police officials were convinced Bolsonaro had fired Valeixo “because he was aware the corporation was closing in on his son”. An editorial in another leading broadsheet  O Globo  said Bolsonaro seemed to want “to turn the federal police into a personal police force  as if he were some kind of third world dictator”. The Folha de São Paulo claimed another of Bolsonaro’s sons  the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro  was also being investigated for possible involvement in the fake news group. Eduardo Bolsonaro  who is the South America representative of Steve Bannon’s far-right group The Movement  claimed on Twitter the claims were “an attempt to confuse the population”. He also retweeted an image of a dog defecating on the newspaper’s masthead. Jair Bolsonaro and his backers have been battling to regain control of the narrative since Moro’s damaging exit  painting the former judge as a pro-choice  anti-gun traitor to their far-right cause. Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing in a rambling speech in which he claimed he was the victim of a political conspiracy. “Powerful people have risen up against me. This is a reality. This is the truth. I’m fighting against the system – against the establisher [sic] ” he claimed. “We are  in the figurative sense  going to get shot in the face loads. But we will fulfil our mission ” Bolsonaro vowed. But claims investigators had identified the president’s son as part of the alleged fake news network – something political foes have long suspected – prompted fresh calls for the president’s impeachment and reinforced growing doubts over whether the rightwing populist would complete his four-year term. “The government is crumbling ” said Eliane Cantanhêde  a political commentator for the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper. “I wouldn’t bet on an impeachment – either for or against ” she added  pointing to reluctance among some politicians to impeach a third president in less than three decades. “But it’s also hard to imagine Bolsonaro making it through nearly three more years in the midst of this chaos. It’s a real pickle.” Marcelo Freixo  a leftwing congressman  said he would take legal action to block Ramagem’s appointment. “Bolsonaro wants to control the federal police ... because he doesn’t want the federal police to advance in its investigations related to his sons. There’s no doubt about it ” Freixo claimed. “Bolsonaro is protecting his children.” The Guardian has approached Brazil’s presidential communication secretariat for comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947ae471bcfdd2e27428ae8744a26c90e58133fe/0_82_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e9dba8f3a15f26155d8c771da12a1b9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d55b70e630cce61f3710fd7fbbcaf77a016956c/0_190_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff055b054fc4797a5f953ebd0b77be60 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Jair+Bolsonaro%2CBrazil%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/crisis-in-yemen-as-aden-separatists-declare-self-government,world, Crisis in Yemen as Aden separatists declare self-rule, Southern Transitional Council breaks with wartorn state’s internationally recognised government, The Southern Transitional Council’s armed forces were deploying on Sunday in Aden  the interim seat of the internationally recognised government backed by the Saudi-led military coalition that had until now included the STC. The United Arab Emirates  unlike Saudi Arabia  has backed the STC  so the move has the potential to create tensions between two close Gulf allies against one another  complicate the task of securing a national agreement to end to the five-year civil war  and possibly restore the geographical division that existed in the former British colony before unification of Yemen in 1990. The STC made its move on Saturday  announcing emergency rule in Aden and all southern governorates  but there were early signs that many of these governorates will not follow the STC’s lead  leaving the political map of Yemen even more fractured. The STC said it had acted because the Riyadh agreement  a deal between the STC and the UN backed government of Yemen brokered by Saudi Arabia last November  was not bring implemented. In an effort to stem the scale of the southern rebellion  the foreign minister of the UN-recognised Yemen government  Mohammed al-Hadrami  condemned the STC’s move as “a resumption of its armed insurgency … and an announcement of its rejection and complete withdrawal from the Riyadh agreement”. He called for Saudi Arabia to take “decisive measures against the continuing rebellion of the so-called Transitional Council”. Hadrami claimed the governors of Shabwa  Socotra  Mahrah and Hadramout had all rejected the STC declaration. However  in Aden on Sunday the STC seized all the major institutions including the port. Saudi Arabia described the STC move as escalatory  and the UAE foreign minister Anwar Gargash insisted “frustration with the delay in implementing the Riyadh agreement should not be a reason to change the situation unilaterally”. The UN special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths said he found the STC move concerning. “Now  more than ever  all political actors must cooperate in good faith  refrain from taking escalatory actions  and put the interests of Yemenis first ” he stressed. The STC’s move  if it takes root  will complicate international efforts to start reconciliation talks as well as any coordinated effort to stave off an outbreak of coronavirus. The separatist movement has been pressing for years for greater autonomy and recognition in any national peace talks. Last year the STC rebelled against the UN-recognised government and seized Aden  and violence spilled over into territory to the west of the city. Saudi Arabia brokered a deal between the two sides on 5 November to form a more inclusive government and place all forces under state control  but the agreement  involving a withdrawal of forces  has hardly been implemented. For five years Riyadh has been using its air power in an attempt to reinstate the Hadi government to power across the country by defeating an Iranian-supported Houthi rebellion. But in recent months Riyadh  faced by the division within the ranks of the forces it backs in Yemen and its own inability to win militarily  has been sending signals that it wants to end the war if the Houthis will compromise. On Friday Saudi Arabia announced it was extending its two-week-old  thinly observed unilateral ceasefire by a four weeks  in a move welcomed by the UK and the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths. Griffiths says he has been trying to convene virtual talks to forge “a permanent comprehensive and mutually agreed ceasefire”  but says this requires the cooperation of all sides. The STC  which has said it wants to be included in any political negotiations  pulled out of committees implementing the Riyadh deal in January. The STC says the Hadi government is gripped by corruption and continually refuses to pay salaries of public-sector staff. The UAE  which like STC opposes the Islamist Islah party that forms part of Hadi’s government in the south  has withdrawn its forces from Yemen over the past 12 months but retains ambitions to control commercial ports across the south. The UAE regards the Islah party as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood  which it opposes across the Middle East. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f613c1dce2219ea5d87764662f0636d4793073ba/0_127_4749_2848/master/4749.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c27f96c46940639dbd97a87b41c2cef https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Yemen%2CMiddle+East+and+North+Africa%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/uk-energy-firms-using-debt-collectors-despite-coronavirus-agreement,business, UK energy firms using debt collectors despite coronavirus agreement, Companies are expected to identify struggling customers and offer them reassurance, Under an agreement with the government  energy suppliers are expected to identify customers who might be in financial distress and offer to reassess  reduce or pause bill payments to help “reassure” homes during the coronavirus lockdown. But many households and small businesses with outstanding balances on their energy accounts may still be targeted by debt collectors with warnings that action may be taken against them if they don’t pay their bills. A letter sent by a debt collector on behalf of Shell Energy  seen by the Guardian  warns one customer that arrangements may be made for a doorstep collector to visit their home in order to chase an outstanding balance of £78.51. It warned that Shell Energy would share the account holder’s details with credit reference agencies which could hurt their ability to switch energy supplier  apply for a mortgage or borrow money. The letter was sent weeks after energy suppliers agreed to support customers who are financially impacted either directly or indirectly by the coronavirus lockdown. Alok Sharma  the business secretary  brought in the measures to help households which “need additional support and reassurance” during the Covid-19 pandemic. They include an agreement that no customers should be cut off during the lockdown. Natalie Hitchins  from the consumer group  Which?  said: “Many customers will have been financially impacted by the coronavirus  so it is concerning to hear that any energy supplier is using debt collectors to place pressure on customers who could be struggling during this difficult time  despite agreeing with the government to support customers in financial distress.” The UK’s largest energy suppliers  British Gas and Ovo Energy  said they were continuing to use debt collectors to engage with their customers. Both companies said they had instructed their debt collectors to offer financial help on their behalf. E.on UK  which merged with npower last year  said it was not handing any new customer details to third-party debt collection agencies but that its debt collectors would continue to pursue long-standing debts built up before the outbreak. A spokesman for Shell Energy said a letter from a debt collection company “is a last-resort attempt to engage with a customer and only after we’ve repeatedly asked them to get in contact to see how we can help”. According to a government spokesman  some suppliers had offered to defer payment deadlines by up to three months and had also suspended following up on debts as part of a package of measures to help households weather the Covid-19 crisis. “This is a worrying time for people across the country and we would expect energy companies to take the current circumstances into account as they carry out their business ” the spokesman said. There are also growing concerns over debt collectors who are targeting the UK’s microbusinesses  which are often family-run and may have been hard-hit by the lockdown measures put in place to stop the spread of the virus. Ed Dodman  a director at the Energy Ombudsman  said: “What we have noticed in the early days of the lockdown is that the proportion of financially vulnerable microbusinesses coming to us for assistance is higher than it was before the outbreak  indicating that small businesses  in particular  may be struggling with these issues. “The guidance is quite clear that energy suppliers must consider whether their customers are in financial difficulty and whether they can offer assistance.

Jon Geldart  its director general  said it was in everyone’s interests to kickstart the economy again once it is safe to do so. “Directors from all parts of the UK need to make plans for riding out this tempest  but they can’t get very far if they have no idea what will be happening in a few weeks’ time ” Geldart said. “Business leaders know [the end of restrictions] will not happen all in one go  but that’s why it’s even more important to tell them what they need to prepare for.” A poll of the IoD’s members showed they were more fearful about their company’s future than at any point since the Brexit vote  with business leaders pessimistic about the fortunes of their firms well beyond the current lockdown. Their investment intentions were also at a record low  with revenue and employment for the next 12 months expected to fall dramatically. The bleak business outlook came amid tentative signs of economic life as companies  including builders  retailers and fast-food restaurants  prepare to reopen after devising new safety regimes. With the lion’s share of UK businesses forced to close in order to comply with lockdown  parts of the economy have come to a virtual standstill. The manufacturing and services industries suffered a record collapse in trade in April  while the picture from the high street is also grim  with predictions that sales could be down as much as 30% as Britons stay away from the shops. With the gloomy data piling up Gertjan Vlieghe  a member of the Bank of England’s interest-rate setting committee  said last week that early indicators pointed to an economic contraction “faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century  or possibly several centuries”. For the first time since the IoD started the survey four years ago  the poll of directors’ views on the outlook for their companies over the next 12 months delivered a negative reading. While 24% of the IoD survey’s 1 003 respondents were positive about their company’s future  the number who were pessimistic was 46%  resulting in a net negative balance of 22%. Its measure for the economy as a whole was also dire  with a negative reading of 69%  the lowest ever recorded by the monthly survey. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06baaa44c8f2df2b761b9a95f8739fd990ed9393/0_392_5874_3524/master/5874.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0005c4032f631c02c40c9c495d99eeff https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Institute+of+Directors%2CConstruction+industry%2CRetail+industry%2CManufacturing+sector%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/uk-economy-will-take-three-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-ey,business, UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus – EY, Report warns that half of all UK consumer spending in 2020 will be delayed or lost completely, As the damage for jobs and growth unfolds  the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis. One month on from the imposition of lockdown measures across Britain  effectively bringing large swathes of the economy to a halt  the group warned that almost half of all consumer spending in 2020 – the major engine of UK growth over recent decades – is at risk of either being delayed or lost completely. The group of economists said GDP was set to collapse by 6.8% in 2020  before returning to positive growth of 4.5% in 2021 as businesses try to make up for lost time and consumers ramp up their spending again. The forecast is based on the assumption that some lockdown restrictions will start to be eased in May  with controls relaxed further in June. As such  the Item Club believes the economy should benefit later in the year from a degree of pent-up demand as people are allowed to travel again and return to the shops. Howard Archer  the chief economic adviser to the Item Club  said the report assumes that the government’s measures aimed at supporting businesses and saving jobs would have a significant positive impact. “[The support] is absolutely crucial to limiting the potential longer-term damage to the economy ” he said. In a separate report  the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts  Manufactures and Commerce said one in three jobs in parts of Britain were at risk due to Covid-19. It said Richmondshire in North Yorkshire – which includes chancellor Rishi Sunak’s constituency – tops the list of areas likely to be most affected  with 35% of jobs vulnerable owing to the area’s reliance on hospitality and tourism. Jobs in London  Oxford and Cambridge  and the London commuter belt were least at risk  it said. The Item Club said GDP would fall by about 13% in the second quarter amid the widespread lockdown measures in place across Britain and in other big economies  sliding six times faster than in the deepest quarterly decline of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment could hit 6.8%  surging from a rate of 4% before the crisis struck. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6e4573b4846c57276e7e23ee87f086a6f97333/0_139_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=149945517fe269932b4b8a835c8a8018 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd49e6695e984f2957da9e180e4cbd02f8d049ff/0_0_4387_2632/master/4387.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ec0dd486f980ad84d8e06a349d89876 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f2919d12293bc23892b584ce65c7a9eb14b3be/0_411_4780_2869/master/4780.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ca1b2d4b603de9ca2ba7c79ed887e82 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Economics%2CBusiness%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUnemployment%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/26/uk-traffic-to-film-and-tv-piracy-sites-up-nearly-60-in-lockdown,media, UK traffic to film and TV piracy sites up nearly 60% in lockdown, Figures mirror rise in legal streaming  while comedy and family shows thrive on TV, In the last week of March  visits to film piracy sites were up by 57% compared with the last week of February. Sites allowing viewers to illegally watch TV shows and series saw a 29% increase across the same period. In total there were more than 300m visits to sites allowing film and TV content to be downloaded illegally last month  as millions of homebound Britons hunted out more home entertainment to pass the time. “Piracy or unlicensed consumption trends are closely linked to paid-for or licensed content ” said Andy Chatterley  the chief executive of Muso  which tracks piracy trends. “So just as Netflix has seen large subscriber gains  we have seen a significant spike in visits to film and TV piracy sites. Demand for content via piracy has grown exponentially.” As the nation stays home  viewing levels are soaring  with households watching an average of five hours more TV each week than before lockdown  according to the TV marketing body Thinkbox. A report on lockdown TV habits noted a penchant for lighter fare  with viewing of comedy shows up 40% in the first three weeks. Nostalgia comedy was popular  with viewing of Only Fools and Horses on Gold up 20% year on year and Last of the Summer Wine up 30%. Family nights in are also back on the agenda  with shared TV viewing up 37% since lockdown began. Shows including Channel 4’s Gogglebox (up 41%)  and channels such as Sky Cinema  which has lots of family-friendly films (up 48%)  have benefited. “TV is again uniting Britain ” said Ben Page  the chief executive of Ipsos Mori  which conducted the research for Thinkbox. “New routines and habits are emerging  with TV bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences.” Sky reported a “box-set effect” among its pay-TV customers with a 26% increase in downloads of series ranging from Game of Thrones to Save Me Too and Sex and the City  hitting 123m in the period from 17 March to 5 April. Accessing apps such as Netflix and YouTube via Sky is also booming  up by a third over the same period with more than 50m requests by viewers. “Interestingly  we’re not just seeing viewers watch comedies or old classics to escape these uncertain times ” said Zai Bennett  managing director of content at Sky. “We’re seeing that people are looking for variety in lockdown  from premium dramas and cinematic comedy as well as more escapist TV.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445d967bb927793ea2700852907a1b6c363543c0/0_0_2568_1541/master/2568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff4b536ff40580975ee75fa315cbcd5b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Television+industry%2CTV+streaming%2CPiracy%2CFilm+industry%2CPiracy%2CFilm%2CCulture%2CMedia%2CBusiness%2CTechnology%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/virgin-atlantic-hires-bank-in-search-for-emergency-funds,business, Virgin Atlantic hires bank in search for emergency funds, More than 100 potential investors contacted to help keep airline afloat, It is understood more than 100 potential investors have been contacted. The UK government rejected Virgin Atlantic’s first attempt to secure a £500m loan to keep the airline afloat while most of its planes are grounded. Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Branson’s Virgin Group and 49% owned by Delta Air Lines. Branson’s attempt to secure taxpayer money has been met with criticism from the public and politicians  who have said the billionaire should fund the airline himself. It has been pointed out that Branson has paid the exchequer no personal income tax in 14 years  since he moved to his private island in the tax-free British Virgin Islands. Branson is the UK’s seventh richest person  with an estimated £4.7bn fortune. Branson has said previously: “I’ve seen lots of comments about my net worth  but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis  not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw.” Branson’s spokesman said on Sunday: “Virgin Group is providing liquidity to help support its companies and save jobs. Richard and the Virgin Group are committed to the airline and are not looking to sell Virgin Atlantic. They recognise that further investment will be necessary to make up for the total loss of revenue due to Covid-19 and are working with Houlihan Lokey to approach private investors about the investment opportunity.” Earlier reports on Sunday said Branson had set a deadline of May to sell the airline  which he founded in 1984 and has often referred to as “one of my children”. Delta has ruled out pumping fresh funds into the airline as it faces its own cash crisis. Virgin Australia called in administrators last week after it failed to secure a A$1.4bn (£715m) bailout from the Australian government. That airline is 10% owned by Virgin Group. Branson has pledged to inject $250m (£197m) into Virgin Group  his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships  and which employs about 70 000 people. The pledge – of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline – represents 5% of his fortune. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “Because of significant costs to our business caused by unprecedented market conditions which the Covid-19 crisis has brought with it  we are exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding. Houlihan Lokey has been appointed to assist the process  focusing on private sector funding. Meanwhile  we continue to take decisive action to reduce our costs  preserve cash and protect jobs.” Britain’s airline industry has urged the government to extend the coronavirus job retention scheme as people are expected to delay all flight for months to come. Tim Alderslade  the chief executive of Airlines UK  asked the Treasury to provide certainty about the scheme  according to Sky News. “We believe that the scheme will need to be extended beyond June  and that consideration should be given to measures – including a ‘tapering’ of the scheme or a review on a sectoral basis – to avoid aviation facing a cliff-edge post-June whilst services are scaled up ” he said. • This article was amended on 27 April 2020 because Virgin Atlantic has not grounded all of its planes  as an earlier version said. It is operating some cargo-only and repatriation flights. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aec9b49b6f5f467607ee0b452e9ef0a4f424da5/0_108_1928_1157/master/1928.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b4f0e98633d5c4b3651ee0c96967515 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052b530db28bc50c8726b20931fb18af85468eed/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a8f2ec5689e838781cf60bde6d76a98 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/066aacf844d7bd4c699fe0378ddca309c3379cee/0_169_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92def788753024fd34a69b8c651ae57c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97612a6181faa1db404b619924bd71e4699bdfc7/259_836_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8b156b87903db0ca56827aba965ade4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1131dfb72cb49ca3326d78ab08334dfdf230a9dd/0_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57ac5838dfbaec4c4cea5c2724176ef3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Virgin+Atlantic%2CRichard+Branson%2CAirline+industry%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
26/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-boris-johnson-is-riding-high-but-will-he-beat-the-curse-of-the-crisis,business, Boris Johnson is riding high  but will he beat the curse of the crisis?, Governments unfortunate enough to be in power when a crisis strikes tend to get the blame, Five months after being reinstalled in Downing Street  Major faced a run on the pound that culminated in Britain’s departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday  16 September 1992. The economy recovered but Major’s political reputation never did. The mood was similarly downbeat in Labour ranks last December  when the party again notched up a fourth straight defeat  and this time by an even bigger margin than in 1992. And for a couple of months following his election triumph Boris Johnson lorded it just as Major had done after seeing off Neil Kinnock. Yet  as then  things have gone downhill fast. The economy went into enforced hibernation in mid-March and is at its nadir this month. Evidence of that will come through in May – five months after the election. Governments unfortunate enough to be in power when a crisis strikes tend to get the blame. Ted Heath was held responsible for the three-day week in early 1974 and Jim Callaghan was booted out following the 1978-9 Winter of Discontent. Black Wednesday did for Major and Gordon Brown lost power as a result of the banking crisis of 2008. It didn’t really matter that Black Wednesday proved to be a boon to the economy  since leaving the ERM meant the pound and interest could fall; nor that Brown is seen – by fair-minded observers  at least – to have handled the global financial crisis well. Johnson will need to go some – or Labour will need to be truly incompetent – for this pattern to be broken. This is no ordinary crisis: early indicators suggest that one-in-three private sector employees are either furloughed or have lost their jobs. Three quarters of households have suffered a fall in their incomes. The government will need to sell £180bn of gilts in the next three months to cover the cost of the economy being in hibernation. This is worse – far worse – than anything in recent or  indeed  distant history. Jan Vlieghe  one of the members of the Bank of England committee that sets interest rates  said the UK was facing its biggest slump in three centuries. Nor is this going to be over quickly. The need to prevent reinfection means the economy will only come out of lockdown slowly and – unlike in other countries – there is no suggestion of when that might start. Failing to take Covid-19 seriously in January and early February  a period when Johnson and his team were effectively winging it – has proved not just costly but fatal. On the basis of the relative scanty data out there  the Office for Budget Responsibility’s projection of a 35% fall in output in the second quarter of 2020 looks reasonable. A slightly smaller fall in gross domestic product might occur if parts of the economy reopen in late May and June  but even then in the best case a drop of 25% looks probable. The OBR is also assuming that half the restrictions will be lifted in the third quarter  the rest will go in the fourth quarter  and that there will be no lasting damage done. On that basis  output will be back to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year. This looks far less realistic. For a start  there are already signs that some firms are going bust and that workers are being made redundant  despite government assistance. Moreover  Chris Whitty  the chief medical officer has warned that social distancing will remain in place until at least the end of the year  and that means large chunks of the economy – bars and restaurants  for example – have no chance of being back to business as usual. This recession is far more severe than that of 2008-09 and it will take time for the economy to return to its pre-crisis level. The chances of the UK emerging from this without deep scarring are zero. Johnson’s cabinet – as has been highlighted during his enforced absence due to illness – is weak: far less impressive than the team of ministers that Major had round him at the time of Black Wednesday. Rishi Sunak has looked competent; the rest have seemed out of their depth. What’s more  the things Johnson has got going for him are all diminishing assets. The government may be taking comfort from the fact that the Covid-19 crisis happened within months of the election  leaving plenty of time to put the economy straight. But the effects of this slump are going to be felt for years not months. Nor should ministers assume that public support for the government’s handling of the crisis is going to last. The longer this goes  the longer the list of screw-ups becomes. It is not a good look to be seen as clueless when that cluelessness has cost lives and livelihoods. All things considered  the government has had an easy ride from the opposition parties  which have been reluctant to be too critical at a time of national emergency. There have been signs in the past couple of weeks that Labour has started to toughen up its stance  with Keir Starmer asking pointed and appropriate questions  such as why was the government slow to respond to the crisis  slow to provide enough tests  slow to provide enough protective gear and slow to come up with an exit strategy. Starmer will never match Johnson for charisma but he is a lawyer who knows how to make a case. So was John Smith  Labour leader at the time of Black Wednesday  and he had a fine old time at Major’s expense. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Larry-Elliott,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7b230406d755166fb74384c5236e7c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03cd0e3c4a981b75a799def3bbb59195b1835d35/0_20_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a393db1d8b93ce8958a0a42b2e530f66 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Larry-Elliott,-R.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Economics%2CBoris+Johnson%2CKeir+Starmer%2CConservatives%2CLabour%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

Blue-chip companies that planned to use the scheme included Primark owner Associated British Foods  easyJet  and British Airways owner IAG  as well as retailers Next and JD Sports. All of the companies that have revealed they have furloughed workers have also announced executive pay cuts. The government has committed to paying the salaries of millions of workers during the coronavirus lockdown to encourage companies to keep employees on even if they are prevented from working. Under the job retention scheme companies will be able to claim back from the government 80% of the salaries of workers who are furloughed  up to £2 500 a month per worker. Some employers have committed to paying the remaining 20% of furloughed workers’ wages. The scheme has been one of the most important measures to cushion the blow to the economy during lockdown. However  Luke Hildyard  the High Pay Centre’s director  said the recipients of taxpayer-funded support would face pressure to cut high executive salaries  given that the unprecedented government support also directly benefits businesses and their shareholders. 37% of FTSE 100 companies have already cut executive pay in order to reduce costs during the coronavirus lockdown. However  only 13% have cut the bonuses  and long-term incentive payments often comprise the biggest component of executive pay awards  raising concerns that pay cuts will not necessarily result in large reductions. “The coronavirus job retention scheme is a vital progressive measure to protect people’s jobs and incomes at this critical time  but it’s important to understand that it is a subsidy for businesses  as well as for workers ” said Hildyard. “The companies that are effectively taking public money to sustain themselves through the shutdown will be under particular pressure to achieve a fairer balance between rewards for executives  investors and their wider workforce in future. But hopefully the sense of solidarity forged in the crisis will raise ambitions for the social and environmental contribution of all businesses.” The £42bn profits made in the last five years by the 18 companies could have covered the expected cost to the government of the scheme  the High Pay Centre’s analysis suggests. The Office for Budget Responsibility  the government’s economic forecaster  estimates as much as 30% of the workforce will be covered at an estimated cost of £42bn. During that same period  those companies paid shareholders £26bn in dividends  although dividend payments are also likely to be significantly lower this year. Some 35 FTSE 100 companies have cut  suspended or cancelled their dividends  according to investment platform AJ Bell. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea22048e02c73a04a9c3f245bce37f204a7fc79/239_0_2886_1731/master/2886.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b7cfedbb7dbd9db57b9d2c91c7bfb2c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Executive+pay+and+bonuses%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPay%2CBusiness%2CFamily+finances https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/30/victoria-beckham-reverses-decision-to-furlough-fashion-label-staff,fashion, Victoria Beckham reverses decision to furlough fashion label staff, Exclusive: application to use public money to support staff is withdrawn following criticism, Following a change of heart by the designer and her board  the application to the government scheme has been withdrawn and all employees concerned restored to their roles. “We will not now be drawing on the government furlough scheme ” Beckham told the Guardian. “At the beginning of the lockdown the shareholders agreed with senior management to furlough a small proportion of staff. At that point we didn’t know how long the lockdown might last or its likely impact on the business. The welfare of my team and our business means everything to me.” After going into lockdown “overnight”  the company “made decisions as best we could to try and protect our staff”  according to a spokesperson. “We’ve now reconsidered and we accept there’s a better way forward for our business. These are tough times and tough decisions and we don’t always get it right - all we can say is we are trying to protect our business and our staff.” A fortnight ago  30 of Beckham’s 120 staff received letters informing them they were to be furloughed for at least two months. Beckham  whose net worth is estimated at £335m and who had been sharing images on social media from the family’s luxury lockdown at home in Oxfordshire when the news broke  was heavily criticised for a claim which would have cost about £150 000 in government funds. The furlough scheme has becoming a lightning rod for high emotion around how the huge economic burden of the crisis is to be shared between taxpayers and wealthy individuals and businesses. Beckham’s reversal follows a pattern seen at Liverpool and Tottenham football clubs. Both initially announced they would furlough non-playing staff  applying to the government-funded job retention scheme for financial support  but subsequently had a change of heart. In a letter to fans the Liverpool’s chief executive  Peter Moore  said: “We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.” However  a source close to Beckham denied that the reversal had been prompted by the backlash  saying that she “is well aware of the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye  and doesn’t complain about it”. A spokesperson for the board said that the company “now believe that with the support of our shareholders  we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme”. Online sales of Victoria Beckham clothing since lockdown have exceeded the revised forecasts drawn up by the business at the onset of the crisis  and although Britain remains in lockdown crucial links in the international supply chain are now emerging from mothballing. All of the Italian factories which produce the label’s garments are scheduled to be up and running by 11 May. Beckham is said to be keen to get back to designing the next collection – although the catwalk schedule is currently on pause  with fashion weeks in June and July cancelled and the major September shows in London  New York  Milan and Paris likely to be scaled down  postponed  or otherwise reimagined. The backtracking reflects signs of cautious optimism in the fashion industry  as some regions of the globe begin the process of reopening after the crisis. Predictions that quarantine would cause seismic shifts in consumer behaviour and snuff out demand for fashion and luxury in the long term are being called into question by recent reports from China. On 11 April  the first day of reopening  the Hermes boutique in Guangzhou took $2.7m  the brand’s highest ever single day takings. The phenomenon is being dubbed “revenge spending”. The furore highlights the delicate position that Victoria Beckham and her brand occupy in British public life. As a designer she has a huge brand name  but a relatively small business. Against the global luxury giants against whom she competes for customers  her label is a minnow. Having taken £30m in investment from Neo Investment Holdings three years ago  the designer and her husband own 47% of her label  with the majority owned by the board. The brand has established itself as one of the most respected and influential fashion houses on the show circuit  but has yet to turn a profit. The family star power of “Brand Beckham” brings her label the kind of public interest most designers can only dream of. The front row line-up of David Beckham and the couple’s four children next to Anna Wintour has become an iconic fashion week image. But the Beckhams’ status brings with it an expectation that Victoria is to be judged not as a fashion designer  but as a public figure. Before this crisis  the label is thought to have been on course to break even this year. Beckham has foregone her salary for the foreseeable future  and she and other shareholders are planning to put in more investment to keep the business functioning through the crisis. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6eb2695a25845f652e57d85721ec3ecb70d0751/0_280_2206_1323/master/2206.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78f6a78c48634326270c1aed032abf19 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2383b4b15a61da90a1b79d8a3b15c1866ca84334/193_141_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba633bcd1ace82ff75fd3b67e9883171 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f427a8f9acd4ff3ff7aa840201423030fdc823f4/2191_148_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efc92e54c8e2c753ea45d180fd981502 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Fashion%2CVictoria+Beckham%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson,politics, Johnson promises plan next week for return to schools and work, PM says UK is past peak of coronavirus and vows to produce road map for economy, Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus  taking it to a total of 26 771  the prime minister suggested the worst was over. “I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope ” he said  three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself. Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital  the prime minister at times appeared breathless. He robustly defended his government’s handling of the outbreak  after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. “We’re learning lessons every day – but I do think that  broadly speaking  we did the right thing at the right time ” he said. Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner  he said: “Don’t forget  it’s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do – very tough – and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.” Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a “comprehensive plan” setting out “how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy”. However  he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control. “What you are going to get next week is really a road map  a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic  what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.” The Labour leader  Keir Starmer  welcomed the prime minister’s statement  after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its “exit strategy” – though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase. “I’ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy ” Starmer said. “We’ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he’s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it  and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan. We’ll look at it when we see it  but it’s a step in the right direction.” The government’s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing  and a sustained fall in the death rate. But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R  the reproduction number for the virus  measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects. The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1  but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment  the government’s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9. England’s chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  urged caution  saying: “As soon as R goes over one  then you restart exponential growth – it may be slow if it is just over one  it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one – but exponential growth restarts and  sooner or later – and the higher it is  the sooner it is – the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.” One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5 000 per day – the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing. However  the UK is quite some way off that goal. The official figures show at least 6 000 people tested positive on Wednesday  but the real number is likely to be much higher than that because many cases in the community are not being tested. The Scottish first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  told the Scottish public on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that there would be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. “It is likely by the time we get to this time next week  which is the 7 May review day  it will not be possible in any meaningful way to lift these restrictions ” she said. “We have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts. But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.” In Whitehall  ministers have been scrambling to draw up plans for the next phase of the crisis  which Johnson’s deputy  Dominic Raab  has described as a “new normal”  rather than a return to the pre-lockdown life. Johnson said for the first time on Thursdaythat this could include the public being advised to wear face masks. Asked about the issue  the prime minister said: “I do think face masks will be useful  both for epidemiological reasons  and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.” His remarks contradicted the stance of some cabinet colleagues. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  said earlier this week there was only “weak science” supporting the use of face masks. The Cabinet Office minister  Michael Gove  warned on Wednesday they might tempt people to behave in a “cavalier” manner. The mayor of London  Sadiq Khan  welcomed the government’s apparent change of heart  saying: “I am pleased that the prime minister has said that non-medical face coverings will play an important role as we eventually look to lift lockdown restrictions. This is something I and others have been pushing the government to change the guidance on.” Downing Street believes more people could safely return to work even before the lockdown is formally lifted  if distancing measures are complied with. Some manufacturers  including the car maker Rolls-Royce  have restarted production lines – and the DIY chain B&Q announced on Wednesday that it would reopen its stores. The chancellor  Rishi Sunak  has been keen to see more of the economy reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the unprecedented measures introduced to help firms and households weather the crisis will cost £104bn in this financial year. Asked whether meeting the costs would mean a fresh round of austerity when the outbreak was over  Johnson insisted it would not  saying: “That will certainly not be part of our approach.” “I think the economy will want to bounce back strongly. I think that this government will want to encourage that bounceback in all kinds of ways ” he said. In preparation for an easing of lockdown restrictions  the business secretary  Alok Sharma  is drawing up guidance for safe working in different types of setting. Business groups and unions are expecting to see a first draft of this weekend. The education secretary  Gavin Williamson  has been examining plans for what he has called a “phased” reopening of schools. Testing for coronavirus has increased significantly in recent days as eligibility has been extended to new groups  with 81 611 tests carried out on Wednesday  according to the Department of Health and Social Care  although only 54 575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90 000. It will not be clear until Friday afternoon whether Hancock has met his self-imposed target of 100 000 tests a day by the end of April. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83565fea77c4eb9107418359dbd125e40a195/845_1327_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7552e116e5d1db85120e82637abe2a7d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CBoris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/entire-order-of-250-chinese-ventilators-were-useless-despite,uk-news, Entire UK order of 250 Chinese ventilators ditched over danger to lives, Doctors found breathing kits were so badly made they feared they could kill patients, All of the devices in a consignment of 250 ventilators that arrived from China on 4 April posed such serious problems that they could not be used and were ditched. Doctors in NHS hospitals in the West Midlands  among which the ventilators were shared  were so concerned that they wrote to Matt Hancock  the health secretary  warning that they could kill patients. “We believe that if used  significant patient harm  including death  is likely ” they wrote in a letter  which was obtained by NBC News. “We look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients.” The medics warned the Department of Health and Social Care that the oxygen supply in the devices was “variable and unreliable”  their build quality was “basic”  the oxygen connection base was marked as “non-EU” and their fabric case made them hard to clean. The machines were Shangrila 510 ventilators made by Beijing Aeonmed  a major manufacturer of ventilators in China. They were designed for use in ambulances not hospitals  the doctors said. The day they arrived  Michael Gove  the Cabinet Office minister who is helping to co-ordinate the government’s response to the pandemic  thanked China for sending them. “We’ve been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad  including Germany and Switzerland  and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I’d like to thank the Chinese government ” he said at the government’s daily news conference  in comments that were widely reported. However  hospitals that then received the devices could not get them to work  despite technical staff spending several days trying to do so. A senior official at one of the hospitals involved said: “All of the ventilators failed. Nothing worked. They didn’t have proper oxygen centres and the tubing didn’t fit. We were irate. All the hospitals tried to get them to work but we couldn’t. “At the time we were really worried  because we feared that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 needing to be ventilated. Happily  as it turned out we didn’t get quite as many as originally expected so we didn’t need the Chinese ventilators after all  which is just as well.” The ventilators were part of a government drive to increase the NHS’s supply of ventilators from the 8 000 it had before the virus struck  to 30 000  so that anyone needing one during the expected peak of the pandemic could have one while in intensive care. However  that target has since been reduced as hospitals have been able to manage the number of people with Covid-19 needing their care. A well-placed NHS source said the incident highlighted problems that had occurred with a range of medical supplies and equipment ordered from China during the coronavirus pandemic. “Some other stuff ordered from China recently  especially personal protective equipment  has also turned out to be either of a lesser quality than what we need or to be the wrong thing altogether  like T-shirts instead of long-sleeved surgical gowns ” they said. “You have to be careful who you procure stuff from  because the supply and then what ultimately arrives can be very variable. But  then again  we didn’t have enough ventilators to start with because the government was unprepared for coronavirus  so we had to ask China to help.” NBC News reported that it approached the international sales manager for Beijing Aeonmed  who said: “I don’t know ” when asked whether the company was aware of the concerns about its product  before the call ended. The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for its response. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4d39c3937249488ea38d38833cb7e87b02b253/440_1317_1647_988/master/1647.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a21571c67f63d2b89d6a98d943590351 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CMichael+Gove%2CMatt+Hancock%2CChina%2CHospitals%2CNHS%2CDoctors%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds,business, UK watchdog vows to get tough with UK firms over stalled refunds, Move comes after complaints about cancelled holidays and weddings owing to Covid-19, The Competition and Markets Authority has recorded a rise in customer complaints about cancellations and refunds  which it said it would now investigate. It highlighted concerns that firms are refusing refunds or pressuring people to accept vouchers for holiday accommodation that can only be used during a more expensive period. Complaints about cancellations and refunds account for four out of five complaints received by its Covid-19 taskforce. They relate mainly to three areas: weddings and private events; holiday accommodation; and nurseries and childcare providers. The watchdog will tackle these areas first and then move on to other sectors. Thousands of flights have also been cancelled during the pandemic  but this does not fall under the CMA’s investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority  which regulates airlines  has issued advice to travellers and said they should contact it with specific questions. The CMA said that most businesses are “acting reasonably in what are unprecedented circumstances”  but added that consumer rights cannot be ignored. Andrea Coscelli  the chief executive of the CMA  said: “Our Covid-19 taskforce is shining a light on some of the big issues facing consumers in wake of this pandemic. Alongside price-gouging reports  we’re now seeing cancellation issues in their thousands. So far  the CMA has identified weddings  holiday accommodation and childcare as particular areas of concern. “The current situation is throwing up challenges for everyone  including businesses  but that does not mean that consumer rights can fall by the wayside. If we find evidence that businesses are failing to comply with consumer protection law then we will get tough – that means launching enforcement cases and moving to court action where there is a strong reason to do so.” For most consumer contracts  the CMA would expect a full refund to be issued where a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services; no service is provided by a firm; or a consumer cancels or is prevented from receiving the service  for example because of the restrictions imposed by the lockdown. The watchdog said the rights to a refund will usually apply even where the consumer has paid what the business says is a non-refundable deposit or advance payment. It accepts that it may take businesses longer than normal to process refunds  but urged them to make the timeframes clear to customers. A spokesperson added that it would not expect consumers to have to wait “weeks and weeks or even months” for a refund. Salman Haqqi  personal finance expert at online comparison service Money.co.uk  said: “Now is the time for holiday companies  insurers and airlines to step up and provide better options for holidaymakers at this difficult time and form an industry standard response. “This will help people understand what they are entitled to if their holiday has been or is likely to be cancelled. Banks also have a role to play here and support where they can.” The CMA also advised that businesses should not be profiting by “double recovering” their money from the government and customers. Consumer association Which? meanwhile called on the Civil Aviation Authority to clamp down on airlines which were still not refunding passengers. Rory Boland  of Which? Travel  said: “While the CAA is right to remind airlines of their legal obligations to refund passengers for cancelled flights  incidents of carriers openly breaking the law are mounting up and people are being left thousands of pounds out of pocket as a result – so it is clear that more needs to be done to hold airlines to account. ”Asking airlines to issue refunds ‘as soon as practically possible’ does nothing to remedy this  and risks giving too much leeway… the regulator must stand up for passengers’ rights.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8d6ac950a691727af69c5efa469a8d3885c694/0_188_5700_3423/master/5700.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=579b8a1aef2ee8cbd1f05524d7faa7c7 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Travel+%26+leisure%2CConsumer+rights%2CWeddings%2CHotels%2CBusiness%2CLife+and+style%2CTravel%2CChildcare%2CMoney%2CUK+news%2CCompetition+and+Markets+Authority%2CRegulators https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser,world, 'He’s just a wonderful man': how Captain Tom became a superstar fundraiser, The public’s huge response to the 100-year-old  who has raised £32m for the NHS  shows how much it needs some good news, The release included a photograph of the then 99-year-old wearing a navy blue fleece  pushing a walking frame on which was balanced a panama hat and his stick. “We are all being rightly advised to stay home  stay safe and protect our NHS  and that is exactly what local 99-year-old Tom Moore is doing ” the copy began – and  with it  one of the most startlingly successful fundraising stories of our time. How exactly a centenarian managed to capture a nation’s heart – prompting an RAF fly-by  an upgrade in military rank and Piers Morgan pledging ten grand of his own money  not to mention an array of conspiracy theories – is a tale that proves both the ongoing power of the mainstream media and the British public’s hunger for joy during a time of bleak national crisis. The global media onslaught began in Milton Keynes  where the press release caught the eye of Damien Lucas  head of news for a group of local newspapers. Within a few hours the story was on Bedford Today  with a headline about the ambitions of a “Bedford man” and his 100th birthday challenge  inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after breaking his hip and for skin cancer. A local ITV report followed and by 10 April  Good Friday  Captain Tom was live on BBC Breakfast. “You have lived  and you have seen some tough times in this country  can you inspire people who are watching now  just reassure them  it will be fine?” asked Naga Munchetty. “Remember ” he said  “tomorrow is a good day  tomorrow you will maybe find everything will be much better than today.” A star was born. The BBC Breakfast team watched  staggered  as donations to Captain Tom’s Just Giving Page went from £1 000 to a million and beyond. Before long  their rivals on Good Morning Britain had picked up the story  with Piers Morgan pledging £10 000 of his own money. Back in Marston Moretaine  a small village 12 miles from Milton Keynes  journalists and well-wishers began congregating outside the house Captain Tom shares with Hannah and her family  hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero doing his laps. On 16 April Moore finished his challenge live on BBC Breakfast surrounded by a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. By 20 April he had raised over £20m and had recorded a duet with Michael Ball that was on its way to number one in the charts. The family began to worry about crowds outside the house. A neighbour got a number for DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles to see if he could help. Hannah  a huge DIY SOS fan  texted asking if this was really Nick Knowles. He suggested a Facetime call to prove his identity and soon had arranged for a fence to be put up outside the family garden  according to Megan Carver  Knowles’s longtime PR. Carver came on board last week to help field inquiries for free. One of her first calls was to Schillings  the notorious London libel firm  famed for its sky-high fees and celebrity clientele. “It was probably the easiest phone call I’ve ever made ” said Carver. “I explained that Captain Tom’s family needed a bit of help and Schillings immediately said  yes  and of course this will be pro bono.” Schillings contacted Ipso  the press regulator  to ask journalists to stop “either leaning over the fence or placing their long-focus-lens cameras through hedges to take intrusive photographs”  noting that the family had set up a Twitter account  @captaintommoore containing images that could be used for free. Then came the backlash. The family had to refute claims that they or Maytrix were profiting from the fundraising. A virulent Whatsapp message had spread  claiming they were lining their own pockets and accusing JustGiving  the fundraising platform  of keeping up to £2m. Full Fact  the independent fact-checking charity  reported JustGiving was in fact taking around 1% of the total: around £320 000 of the £32m pledged by Thursday late afternoon for NHS Charities Together. Back at the village  the family could no longer cope with the deluge of cards and presents arriving from around the world. Bill Chandi  the local postmaster  stepped in to help  offering his post office as their correspondence address. “Since then I have been working 24/7 and it is my honour to do so ” said Chandi. Bedford school  where Captain Tom’s grandson Benji is a pupil  offered its school hall to house the cards. By Thursday they were spilling out into the classrooms too. “He’s already received at least 160 000 cards ” said Chandi. “Quite a few people want to make sure they definitely get to the right place so they send them recorded delivery  which means we have to log them all in the post office – we don’t sign for them because of social distancing.” The local sorting office has had to set up a separate “Captain Tom” team with two or three dedicated workers  he added. On Thursday  Captain Tom became Colonel Tom  promoted to an honorary role by the British Army. Boris Johnson wished him happy birthday  the Queen sent her customary telegram and a wartime Spitfire and Hurricane flew over Marston Moretaine. He has been the perfect hero for our times  says BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani. “There’s nothing self-centred or grandiose about Captain Tom. He’s just a wonderful man. You can tell it has hit a nerve with viewers when they are looking for something to rally around. He brings a little bit of good news and light into what are very difficult times.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Helen-Pidd,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1cd6a033e1bd1c940a296ab06e44b124 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e5b503e665373ec1ce3993afb1b7b16880f9c4/0_33_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dbc79c7468f0fd63a8dc7237343964fa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3a120ab7dc58c60e2abc80e5b0aa76d2dd51d1b/184_0_2482_1491/master/2482.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=469de668db9c9e637649e40c028aa929 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a029b63686cac3b73b01a97bb7cb2710be379c19/0_153_5346_3207/master/5346.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da09550da091ef94f7253f53cc5cc192 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f20ca397be841f87185e417064da321550e75cc/0_408_5399_3240/master/5399.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c2f2fda3913c0c5be86ffa760215aed https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8124117a5dfe75c24e3fc0e4fd702b071c883e1/102_0_1547_928/master/1547.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=458ffd7c80167754234db2d03798920d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CCharities%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-police-receive-200000-calls-from-lockdown-snitchers,world, UK police receive 194 000 calls from lockdown 'snitches', Police chiefs says people finding it harder to observe measures the longer they go on, The figures from the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) give an insight into how the tough rules  and fears of the virus spreading  have affected communities. Sara Glen  a deputy chief constable who is part of the NPCC’s leadership tackling coronavirus  said: “We have members of the public who are coming in on the phones and [via the internet] to report where they’ve got concerns either at gatherings of people that they can see from their locations  or if they think people aren’t adhering to the regulations and that’s actually putting them at risk.” Some of the calls about lockdown rules allegedly being broken are counted in figures on reports of antisocial behaviour  which surged to around 215 000 in the four weeks to 27 April  compared with about 106 000 in the same period last year. Glen said concerns were also being raised about what was going on in other people’s households  such as possible domestic or child abuse. Five weeks since laws enforcing the lockdown began  and with a decision looming about an extension soon  police said it was getting harder for people to comply. The NPCC chair  Martin Hewitt  said: “I think it is inevitable that people will get restless  this is now quite an extended period of time.” He said last weekend police saw more traffic and people out  but compliance levels were the same. “I just think there is an inevitability that as the weeks progress  this is harder for people  and we are moving into warmer weather.” Increasing numbers of fines are being issued for infringing lockdown . In the two weeks to 13 April   which included the long Easter weekend  4 152 fines were issued in England alone  and in the next fortnight there were 4 725 fines. Two-thirds of the fines are being given to people aged under 34  and eight out of 10 to men. Fines start at £60  reduced to £30 for prompt payment  and further breaches can lead to costs doubling each time  to a maximum of £960. Some 391 people were fined more than once. One person has been fined six times  three people have been fined five times  six people fined four times and 343 fined twice. Glen said “troublesome spots” include beaches and rural communities in the countryside where people want to walk. Officers have been accused at times of heavy handedness for setting up checkpoints  shaming people with drones and in some cases getting confused by the new laws  leading to people being wrongly prosecuted or fined. But Hewitt said so far 0.02% of population had been fined – around one in every 5 000 people – supporting the impression of large-scale adherence to the lockdown  and police leaders believe their policy of enforcement being a last resort has worked. NPCC figures show a postcode lottery of enforcement. Thames Valley police recorded the highest number of fines  649  while the biggest force  the Met in London  issued 634. Warwickshire issued 22 fines  the fewest of any force. Dorset issued 116 but next door in Devon and Cornwall there were 510 fines. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15527e30010996c8d581cbc502d027a776892501/0_88_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a24ce4afd51900b06476083e18659a23 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Police%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify,world, What does the 'R' number of coronavirus actually signify?, One figure in particular is being closely scrutinised as ministers decide when to end lockdown, At the start of the coronavirus epidemic  the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu  but lower than for measles. That means that each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average  before either recovering or dying  and each of those people would each pass it on to a further two to three others  causing the total number of cases to snowball over time. The reproduction number is not fixed  though. It depends both on the biology of the virus  but also our behaviour  such as social distancing. It also depends on the population’s immunity. At the start of an outbreak scientists often refer to the “basic reproductive number”  R0  which is a similar measure to R  but starts with the premise that the population has zero immunity through infection or vaccination. Under the current lockdown restrictions  R is now estimated to have dropped to somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. This means that the epidemic is shrinking – although not uniformly. The figure given for London is 0.5 to 0.7  with some parts of the UK having a higher or lower figure. There is no obvious answer for what R needs to be in order for the lockdown to be lifted. That depends on how low ministers want the total number of cases to be if the government is to be able to effectively track and trace new cases. It is also not clear precisely how easing different restrictions will influence R – there is still uncertainty about how much schools contribute to transmission  for instance. So real-time tracking of transmission will be needed to continue providing a rolling estimate. Because once R inches above 1  even just a fraction  the number of cases will start sharply rising again  putting the UK on the path to a substantial second surge. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68af99c0fe89fcf5e6083e77e2aa082ea14c0b50/317_101_2683_1611/master/2683.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ada879a2b815e3e4d47d992dcc8f01a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CScience%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses,world, Johnson promises 'comprehensive plan' for reopening businesses, Detailed guidelines on working during coronavirus lockdown coming next week  says PM, Large parts of the economy remain closed because of concerns that companies may not be able to adequately protect their workers  but the government is keen for firms to return to work where possible in order to cushion the blow to the economy. The government is due to announce its latest decision on whether to extend lockdown conditions on 7 May  although there is little expectation of any major relaxation of rules  with health services still under pressure. However  the prime minister on Thursday said he expected to present “a comprehensive plan” on how to get the UK economy moving as well as providing childcare for workers  allowing travel to work and allowing safer work within businesses. The business secretary  Alok Sharma  has been gathering views from businesses and lobby groups on guidelines that should be implemented  giving details of how different sectors should adapt. The advice is expected to cover different types of workplace  such as factories  offices  shops  logistics and outdoor work such as farming and mining. While there is no legal impediment to companies returning to work – aside from non-essential retail and public venues that have been explicitly shut down – some businesses are concerned they could face a backlash in the absence of a clear signal from the government. Here is how the different anti-coronavirus measures could work: Any work that cannot be done with social distancing should be done with workers standing either back to back or side by side – rather than face to face. Cleaning of work surfaces will be more regular and shifts should be staggered to prevent large congregations of workers at factory gates or in rest areas – in which 2-metre distancing will be enforced. The carmaker Vauxhall has made face masks and eye protection compulsory at all times. However  sources in other industries have said the government is unlikely to mandate this across the country  given the need to prioritise personal protective equipment for the NHS. There is little prospect of a return to working en masse in offices in the coming weeks  with working from home still encouraged among those who can do so. However  for those who must return to offices  desks will be spaced out and start times could be staggered to prevent rush hour crowding on public transport. Britons have already become familiar with distancing requirements in shops deemed essential by the government. The British Retail Consortium and the Usdaw union have drawn up guidance that covers issues ranging from limiting access to public toilets  to the installation of protective screens at tills and keeping changing rooms permanently closed in clothes shops in order to prevent contamination. Warehouses and trucking companies have been in demand like never before as people are stuck at home. Within warehouses safe practices are almost identical to factories  while delivery drivers who interact with consumers as part of their job need to wait for the customer to pick up packages at a safe distance. In farms  quarries and mines  workers should work side by side if they are unable to carry out their jobs 2 metres apart  and enclosed spaces such as machinery cabs should have windows left open to allow for ventilation. The sale of goods – such as farm produce – should not encourage the gathering of crowds  with online orders and deliveries recommended. Some housebuilders had faced protests over continuing work during lockdown  with concerns that some parts of the job are impossible to do while maintaining 2-metre distancing. However  the housing minister  Robert Jenrick  last week gave clear guidance to the construction industry that it should return to work if possible. The housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is manufacturing a bespoke face shield  which will attach to a construction hard hat and will be used on all its sites for two-person tasks. Large sites such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will have split shifts to reduce overlap. While transport is not thought to be among the sectors to be covered by new business department guidance  any large move back to work will require more public transport. Bus and train companies are hoping for continued government funding to allow them to operate with empty seats – a costly move – to preserve 2-metre distances. Any recovery of the airline industry is likely to be more reliant on international agreements. However  the Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air on Thursday said masks would be compulsory on its flights from now on  with limited flights to resume from Luton airport on 1 May. The Ryanair boss  Michael O’Leary  has rejected the idea of leaving the middle seat empty on planes in order to maintain physical distancing. There is little expectation that public gatherings will be allowed for months  given the focus on reducing the potential for coronavirus to spread. The JD Wetherspoon pub chain plans to reopen in June  although few analysts believe that is likely. Any pre-vaccine reopening would need strict social distancing and cleaning routines – if customers could be persuaded to return. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CUK+news%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/breathless-boris-is-left-floundering-as-he-faces-foe-he-cant-outbluster,politics, Breathless Boris is left floundering as he faces foe he can't outbluster, At his comeback virus briefing the PM repeats same old words  but even he struggles to believe them, The Boss may be back  but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words  but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life  there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror  he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment. His persona that has been carefully constructed over 55 years to protect himself from the pain of being himself is falling apart. Yet still he can’t quite access the humility that might go some way to healing himself. Not that Boris didn’t give it his best shot at papering over the cracks  but it cost him dear. By the end of the press conference he was just two pinprick  bloodshot eyes peeping out of an ashen-white face. If he really feels the need to get back to work so soon  then he can’t have much faith in the rest of his cabinet. There again  that’s one area where you can’t really fault his judgment. “I’m not going to minimise the lack of personal protective equipment or the failure to expedite testing ” he said. Before proceeding to do just that. The lack of PPE and adequate testing – today was the day we were supposed to have reached 100 000 daily tests – have been two of the leading factors in the UK’s mortality rate  but according to Boris the government hadn’t put a foot wrong. The lack of an apology becomes more insulting by the day to the families of the nearly 27 000 people who have died. It appears that the only people in the entire country not to have heard of the 2016 Exercise Cygnus  that highlighted the risks of a pandemic  are the entire government frontbench. Rejoice  rejoice. Sunlight was visible. We had avoided the worst-case scenario of 500 000 dead by burrowing under the alpine mountain. Boris appeared to have both forgotten that we were already well past the 20 000 “best-case result” of his chief scientific adviser  Patrick Vallance  and that – even allowing for statistical variations – the UK had a fatality rate significantly higher than that of Germany or South Korea and might even have the worst record of any country in Europe. The line that the government did the right things at the right time becomes ever more untenable. What can’t be admitted is that Boris effectively took a 10-day holiday in March  at a time when he could have done more to protect the country. Seldom has so much been owed by so few to so many. Boris then breezed on to the R rate – AKA the reproduction rate. Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK’s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9  no one has the first idea of Boris’s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six – though even Boris doesn’t appear to know if it’s more – and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly. On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one. Even Vallance and England’s chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  couldn’t help Boris out with that one. The only certainty was more uncertainty. The questions only revealed how little everyone really knew  as Boris had no clear answers to anything. He couldn’t say anything on tourism to Cornwall – “there will be more information later” – and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum. Even if you’re really desperate  you’re lucky to get an appointment inside six months these days. An embarrassed Whitty eventually had to intervene and point people in the direction of mental health charities if they needed urgent help. Otherwise  there was just more of the same. The scientists urging caution while Boris talked big about the economy bouncing back  avoiding the second peak and enforcing the wearing of face masks which only a month ago he had said were a waste of time. But deep down  Boris knows he’s met his match. Up till now  he’s never found a situation in his life which he couldn’t bluster his way out of. Now he’s come up against a power greater than himself; coronavirus is so far immune to almost everything. In a straight contest between coronavirus and bullshit  the coronavirus wins every time.  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d5b9070b0be6cb46794d0e80e54f84debf42cd6/0_170_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0574d7a281fe9727440e6cd09518c914 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/i-feel-completely-lost-families-tell-of-covid-19-care-home-deaths,world, 'I feel completely lost': families tell of Covid-19 care home deaths, Fearing for  and losing  loved ones in locked-down homes has left relatives with anger and confusion, “We thought he was safer than any of us ” said June Findlater  whose 98-year-old father  David Thorburn  died from Covid-19 on Tuesday morning in a council care home near Glasgow. Three weeks ago  families were told the virus had arrived in the home with the shocking news a resident was dead. David  a “very dignified” former engineering lecturer and Robert Burns enthusiast who “enjoyed his meals”  was suddenly at risk. “It was the first we heard ” said June. “My heart sank. I knew there would be panic. Then there was another death. We started to think ‘oh  no’. Plus dad had a new cough.” Information about what was happening was hard to glean and sometimes apparently contradictory. Last Wednesday  the message was that David was sitting up singing songs; the next day he stopped eating and drinking. “It was awful ” June said. “I wanted to go in [wearing] a black bin liner – home-made. We struggled to get feedback from staff. It’s not about blame  we just wanted to be communicated with.” What the family had not been told was that the GP had already concluded that David was suffering from Covid-19  and had written a prescription to treat him. They only found out four days later. “We know the care was good  but the communication has left us so disappointed.” He died peacefully on Tuesday morning. But for June  who is still trying to find out exactly what happened  one thing is already clear: the residents were “sitting ducks”. It was midnight on Easter Sunday when Diana Samuels last saw her husband  Harvey. The 82-year-old had died 90 minutes earlier of suspected Covid-19 in a care home in Harrow. For weeks  the only contact between them had been a weekly 20-minute WhatsApp video call. That was all that the home would arrange for residents during lockdown. Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link. “It was just so weird ” she said. “You are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock  I couldn’t believe it.” He looked blue  which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia  but otherwise had been reasonably healthy. Diana was full of praise for the care staff: “They are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.” She has been left feeling angry at the home’s management  though  because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection  she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen. “I feel absolutely gutted ” she said. “I feel completely lost. It is like a bad dream for me. I was not told he was going into a decline. They didn’t tell me they thought he wasn’t going to live. I could have spoken to him. I feel so let down by it all.” She said his death was ascribed to dementia on the death certificate  but his symptoms and the speed of his decline indicated Covid-19. The last proper conversation she had with him was on the Thursday before Easter when he told her he didn’t feel well. “I told him I loved him and he told me he loved me.” “I have been sick with anxiety ” said Susan Birch  whose mother  Ruby Birch  was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 22 April in her Birmingham care home. It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week. Ruby  76  who suffers from mental health problems  relied on social contact and entertainment in the home. All that was gone. The family sent in a mobile phone. “Every time I speak to her I bear in mind there may not be another chance ” Susan said. “I don’t know if she is going to take a turn for the worse. I try to make the most of it and listen to everything she says. I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.” One day  Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype. The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on “snatched phone conversations with care workers”. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her. “I saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on ” she said. “We are trying to source some from my husband’s employer in Brighton. He works for a company now using 3D printers to produce face shields. Hopefully these will be delivered soon.” Sheila Yasamee  96  a former midwife and mother of five  has lived in a care home in Bexhill  East Sussex  since September. But after the first Covid-19 death there last week and more infections this week  her family are considering getting her out. “It’s extremely difficult ” said her daughter  Fara Yasamee. “It may well come down to life or death. This is spreading and [puts] her health and life in real danger … She may die there because of it.” The local GP has stressed that Sheila needs 24-hour care and equipment which cannot be guaranteed beyond the care home  and the local social care officials insist the choice is Sheila’s. Plus her family realise that they would have to go into isolation to look after her to avoid infecting her themselves – and that could go on for months. Sheila “does not really understand the situation and can’t make an informed decision about whether to stay or not”  Fara said. Her mother was “getting very low and depressed being in isolation and not seeing family … She keeps asking  how much longer is this going on?” Since visits were stopped  Fara has spoken to Sheila regularly by phone but it is becoming frustrating not knowing what care is being delivered  what personal protective equipment staff are using  whether workers are sick or how many people are looking after her mother. “I get the feeling that the care home is not being that transparent ” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation. It feels like whatever decision we take is not going to be right.” On 20 April  Katrina Wheeler heard that coronavirus had entered the care home where her 81-year-old mother  Pat  lives 300 miles away. It meant Pat and the other residents would be confined to their rooms indefinitely. “She feels that she is imprisoned ” said Katrina. “She knows why  but she can’t make the connection with her being on her own.” Pat  who has mental health difficulties  is struggling without being able to see her closest friend in the home  with whom she used to share much of her time. “I feel guilty that I can’t take her away from the environment and make her safe ” said Katrina. She also spoke of difficulty getting information about how the outbreak is being handled. “They are not being forthcoming ” she said. “They are probably extremely busy and it’s the last thing on their mind  but information is really important in terms of what is going on.” On Tuesday this week they were told that Pat was being tested for Covid-19 after showing symptoms. “She might not test positive but she is going to be in isolation until at least the end of the year ” said Katrina. “How is she going to be able to cope with that?” “It was just awful  it’s devastating ” said Dr Cathy Gardner. A carer at her father’s care home 150 miles away had called twice to say her 88-year-old father  Michael Gibson  was deteriorating with probable Covid-19 and she should come. After driving as fast as they could from Devon to the care home in Bicester  Gardner and her husband decided they could not go in and risk her mother catching the virus. So they looked at Michael  a former superintendent registrar of births  marriages and deaths  through the window instead. “It’s not what you expect the situation to be at the end of someone’s life and you can’t be there and you can’t hold his hand ” Gardner said. “He looked peaceful  the staff were brilliant but not being with him was terrible.” He was living at the home in Bicester because he had severe Alzheimer’s. He had a chest infection five weeks ago and the GP was worried it was coronavirus  but they did not travel to see him because of the lockdown. “I felt guilty. I felt we should be doing the right thing and shouldn’t make the journey. You don’t want to break the rules. Then one of his carers phoned us to tell us to come. We waited a bit but then she phoned again and said she didn’t think he would survive as she’d seen this before. Her own father had died the week before in the room next to my dad.” Gardner said four other residents had died at the home and the number might be higher. She felt her father’s death could have been prevented and was critical of the lack of testing of staff and residents. “It should have been a matter of course for care homes.” she said. “The most vulnerable sector of the population and you decide not to test. That’s bordering on manslaughter  in my view.” As for the urgent drive to Bicester  she said: “I was glad I saw him  as he died the next evening.” Himani Weir now wishes she had broken her mother out of the care home in south-east London where she died of a confirmed case Covid-19 on 16 April. The last weeks were that difficult. For 18 months  Weir had visited Octavia Jayasuriya  84  four times a week as she endured Parkinson’s disease and heart problems. Then came the lockdown and her decline began. “I felt immediately out of touch with my mother ” Weir said. “During the first week we were doing video calls and she was reassuring me that she was OK. But a week or so later I got very concerned when I saw her on a FaceTime video. She looked very unwell.” The care home was not allowing visitors but she went with her daughters and saw her though the window. “She was looking terrible ” she said. “Her eyes were closed and none of the staff who were going in and out were in PPE. I raised my concern about that with the manager and she said that they were not wearing PPE until they saw symptoms with the residents.” A resident had died of confirmed coronavirus in hospital and Weir was increasingly worried. By mid-April  staff were so concerned they called the family for an end-of-life visit. “I could see there were tears in her eyes ” she recalled. “She was sad. She gave me a look and it was a look of unconditional love. If you could hug a person with your eyes  that’s what she did.” Weir was with her mother on the day she died and  while she feels the staff cared for her well  she is frustrated her mother died from the virus. “I felt guilty and I felt confused because the information was patchy. I felt I’d let my mum down. I would have kidnapped her  if I’d known. She was a sitting duck and I told the manager after she died that I wish I’d broken her out. She was trapped there.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2620613e201524fab35840f81f78c4e3bedc9f1/0_328_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07dfe9bfaeb3c80ecaddf6cd696ed1ba https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18db2cb4f398ead80347eebf3a39d2ffc68d1a44/82_196_5545_3327/master/5545.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d250f0a5b5dba0f160a90f5ccf2e4eb9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f9cdfa938e859cdd74cd730f3497b366cccdfd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26a7006e206f1249d0f88af234399929 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3fdd939293cf6167023c810aa00cd570bb7029c/0_457_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45dccf6cea88493ec1d9e1af289db8a4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9/0_0_800_1200/master/800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ddd3585ca5a8d1d00a6bc14ecde072b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be21e4c2a73f2b909baefae41fbc81834394f6d9/0_0_2448_3264/master/2448.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29a560e0473e7de73c1d20829836067e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=90d4fe3fed6cfa9a1f562d931d23e1b8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2COlder+people%2CSocial+care%2CSociety%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/uk-carers-lost-jobs-raising-safety-fears-consider-legal-action-covid-19-care-homes,society, UK carers who lost jobs after raising safety fears consider legal action, Charity warns whistleblowers are being sacked from care homes during Covid-19 crisis, As the care industry struggles to grapple with the unfolding pandemic  Compassion in Care  a charity that runs a helpline for whistleblowers  claims the five carers came forward this month to say they no longer had positions after disclosing safety problems. The health workers are contemplating legal action after contacting regulators and authorities with concerns  the charity has said. There is growing concern about the situation inside the country’s care homes  with the sector feared to be at the centre of crisis. On Wednesday  the government released figures that revealed the coronavirus deaths for both in hospitals and the community  including care homes  for the first time. It added an additional 3 811 deaths for those who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the community since the start of the outbreak  bringing the total number of deaths to more than 26 000. The carers’ dismissals  which were first reported in the Times  relate to confidentiality breaches. Three of the carers were sacked  the charity explained  and the other two would have cases for constructive dismissal. Compassion in Care’s founder  Eileen Chubb  who herself was a care industry whistleblower  told the Guardian the carers were thinking about taking legal action via employment tribunals to challenge their cases. She said she believed more carers would lose their jobs for blowing the whistle as the pandemic continued  adding: “Going back four weeks we had people who were raising concerns about PPE  about staffing levels  about the kind of care and also about Covid-19 patients being placed in the home after hospital. All of those issues were raised and now you’ve got a situation where no action was taken weeks later and staff are beginning to think nobody is listening. And they’re right.” Chubb  who said she was not publicly naming the firms the carers had worked at to protect the whistleblowers’ identities  added: “All of the care homes are staffed on a wing and prayer anyway. Then you have something like this happen and you haven’t got the reserves in staff to cover what is happening because the [owners of the homes] have cut everything to get bigger profits and there’s no reserve. “People have got to breaking point now because there’s no action being taken and they can’t see why that action cannot be taken by the employer. So there’s a massive loss of trust and also a huge amount of anger.” Summarising the carers’ concerns  Chubb said: “The overriding theme is going to work everyday and waiting for your concerns to be addressed breaks you a little more each day. In the end  you have no trust left that any action is going to be taken or any positive change is going to come about. “I suppose because staff feel they’re risking their lives doing this  it’s changed the whole dynamic. Whistleblowers contact us all the time so we know whistleblowing  we live it  we know the kind of issues that are going to come up. But this is a whole new thing  this is a situation where in a short amount of time trust is lost much quicker because of the conditions. It’s concentrated in a way we’ve never seen before.” On 6 April  Compassion in Care released figures showing it had received 87 calls in the two weeks prior from staff raising PPE concerns in social care  including 61 in residential homes  20 from nursing homes and six for home care agencies. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d10a0ddeb660649a96f56d96d4f28f5b60c2e98/0_277_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33e870ffe2c8f7d1bd01ccbbaed82326 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Care+workers%2CSocial+care%2CSociety%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CLaw https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/randomised-coronavirus-test-of-100000-will-determine-end-date-of-uk-lockdown,world, Randomised test of 100 000 to help decide end of UK lockdown, Home testing kits will be sent out next week to clear up ‘Wild West’ of Covid-19 estimates, The tests  next week  will provide a national snapshot of the proportion of those infected with the virus ahead of a planned review of restrictions on 7 May. Prof Ara Darzi  the director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London  which is running the study with the pollster Ipsos Mori  said that – short of a vaccine – testing represented the only way out of the lockdown. “But the testing landscape is like the Wild West with no rules  no standards and widely varying reliability ” he added. “With this ambitious programme  the biggest in England  we aim to establish a viable testing programme on which the government can rely.” The 100 000 people  selected from 315 local authorities across England  will be invited to carry out home tests that will show whether they are currently infected with the coronavirus. The team plans to repeat the exercise in four to six weeks’ time – or at a point when lockdown restrictions are being eased – to capture early signals that any resurgence is occurring. “You need the big numbers to be sure that you find low levels of the virus in the community ” said Prof Graham Cooke  a member of the Imperial College team. In the second part of the programme  a number of different antibody tests will be assessed for their accuracy and ease of use at home. The tests will first be carried out on volunteers from Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust who are known to have had the virus  to establish their accuracy. Three hundred public volunteers will also be given a sample test to self-administer  which requires them to place a fingerprick of blood in a cassette  add a dye and read off the result  to assess how well people are able to perform the tests at home. If the tests are shown to be sufficiently accurate and usable  they will be distributed to larger cohorts  with the potential to roll out the antibody testing to 100 000 people later this year  to provide an indication of the prevalence of Covid-19 immunity. Previously the government had floated the possibility of making antibody tests readily available to the public through Boots and Amazon  and ordered millions of commercial kits. It had to backtrack on this proposal after the best performing of these only picked up antibodies about 70% of the time. However  Cooke said that some of the assessments of the accuracy of these tests may have been overly pessimistic  because lab-stored serum was used  rather than blood samples taken directly from individuals. He added that some of the tests might not be sensitive enough to provide results for individuals  but could still provide a broad picture of what proportion of the population had been infected. James Bethell  a health minister  said: “Understanding more about the current spread of coronavirus and the prevalence of antibodies is a vital part of our ongoing response to this pandemic. This ambitious new testing programme will help us track the rate of the infection now. “And  crucially  it will help identify an antibody test that is accurate and easy to use  and which can give us an indication of how many people have already had the infection. This information will inform the future action we take to manage the spread of the virus  including the development of new tests and treatments.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdcef54cb6a50832b45f253ec8c77c56b20ba036/0_205_5383_3230/master/5383.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d82553cb9357161dada8a3207d7814bf https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CScience%2CNHS%2CSociety%2CImperial+College+London https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/five-already-dead-by-time-uk-reported-first-coronavirus-death,world, Five already dead by time UK reported first coronavirus death, Official data shows first fatality happened three days before government announcement, The figures show that the lethal impact of the outbreak had already been recorded when Boris Johnson joked about shaking hands with hospital staff in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing on 3 March  when no deaths had been officially announced. The first death was not made public until two days later on 5 March  when a woman in her 70s died at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading. But the new figures provided to the Guardian by NHS England show that another patient also died that day  at the Pennine acute hospitals trust in Greater Manchester. It also emerged that the first coronavirus death in the UK occurred on 2 March when a care home patient died  according to details confirmed by Public Health England. This was the first of an additional 3 811 deaths that occurred outside hospitals that were added this week to the the UK’s death toll of those who have tested positive for the virus. It has also emerged that the first three hospital deaths occurred in Nottingham  Essex and Buckinghamshire on 3 March – the day of the first Downing Street briefing. At the briefing Johnson said: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.” Johnson would go on to continue shaking hands with people until at least 9 March  when a fifth victim was publicly confirmed to have died in the UK. The updated NHS England data  shows that 16 people had died by 9 March  including three that day. Earlier this month  NHS England said its revised records showed the first death occurred on 28 February  but it has now clarified that this was a data entry error. A spokeswoman said: “The actual date of that death was 28 March  and the 28 February had been put in by mistake. The records have been updated.” She explained that those collating the daily death toll have to rely on data being accurately recorded by individual hospital trusts. She said: “Data teams are checking in daily with trusts on their deaths. The recorded deaths that we announced every day have generally taken place over the previously three or four days.” The time lag on reporting the deaths has meant the impact of the virus actually hit much earlier than previously acknowledged. By 13 March  the end of the Cheltenham festival when 68 000 people gathered for the Gold Cup  there had been 51 deaths in English hospitals at a time when only 11 deaths in the UK had been announced. On the day the lockdown was imposed on 23 March  the government had announced 336 deaths  but by the end of that day there had actually been 802 deaths in English hospitals alone  including 136 that day. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3318cba088463103f03bb15c7aa9584789d4f12/0_156_3311_1986/master/3311.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4298aafa86e946f31f12957b21f280f1 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CNHS%2CSocial+care%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-will-miss-100000-coronavirus-tests-target-minister-admits,world, UK carries out 81 600 tests as deadline for 100 000 target looms, PM reports rise of 30 000 in daily tally of tests  in pursuit of goal set for end of April, Boris Johnson revealed that there had been a huge jump of 30 000 tests in the previous 24 hours  but it will not be clear whether ministers have met their goal until later on Friday. Earlier  the justice secretary  Robert Buckland  had conceded the government was likely to miss its deadline  as only 52 000 tests had been carried out on Tuesday. “Even if we don’t hit it  we will in the next few days hit that target. We are up to 52 000 being tested  capacity is rising and I think it was right to set an ambitious target. Sometimes if you don’t hit a target on the due date  the direction of travel is the most important thing. And I believe we are going to get there and move beyond it because we need more ” he told Sky News. However  the jump of almost 30 000 more tests in 24 hours suggested the government was potentially in touching distance of meeting the target after all. Johnson said 81 611 tests had been carried out on Wednesday  although only 54 575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90 000. There has been suspicion that the government may try to claim that reaching 100 000 capacity for tests as a victory on Friday  even if the testing goal itself is missed. The number of daily tests may also be inflated by the fact that it includes tests sent out in the post  rather than tests actually completed with results. The deadline was set by Matt Hancock  the health secretary  on 2 April as the government came under pressure over low testing levels. At that point  there was capacity for 12 799 daily tests in England  with just over 10 650 tests carried out. The total as of 9am on Wednesday was 52 429 tests with capacity to do 73 000  but only 33 000 individuals were tested because of multiple retests. Ministers will not know until Friday how many tests were carried out on 30 April  but the number is likely to jump substantially because the criteria for those eligible for testing was widened this week to include over-65s with symptoms  those who work outside the home with symptoms  and all care home residents and carers  whether or not they have symptoms. Buckland said he was frustrated by the likely failure to hit the target but encouraged that the rate of increase in testing had expanded so rapidly. Earlier  hospital leaders launched a strident attack on the government’s testing strategy  regardless of the target. Saffron Cordery  the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers  which represents foundation trusts in England  dismissed the 100 000 target as a “red herring” that distracted from the lack of a coherent overall strategy. NHS Providers said in a report on Wednesday: “NHS trust leaders believe they have done all they can to support the national testing effort so far but are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clarity on how the testing regime will be developed for this next phase. “At the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups  with no visibility on any longer term strategy  and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc385a4da9c99b901a6ea1995820a8aca9c02b68/0_206_3083_1849/master/3083.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=002325f72fa5c0fb87f08d274c41deb7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848df96e22391da84683c507ffc24d47be4a0f3e/0_285_5511_3306/master/5511.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd27ae8ec123e11edb6b6cfaf7a90b47 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83565fea77c4eb9107418359dbd125e40a195/845_1327_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7552e116e5d1db85120e82637abe2a7d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CRobert+Buckland%2CPolitics%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/condom-sales-down-as-lockdown-limits-sex-lives-says-durex-makers,society, Condom sales down as lockdown limits sex lives  says Durex maker, Physical distancing rules to limit coronavirus spread taking toll on ‘number of intimate occasions’, Laxman Narasimhan  the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser  the British household goods company that bought Durex in 2010  said condom sales had dropped as people are unable to have as much sex because of the strict physical distancing and lockdown rules. Narasimhan said the amount of sex people were having had “gone down a lot in Italy”  and had also fallen in the UK and elsewhere as people stopped having casual hook-ups. Meeting up with people who do not live in the same household is against lockdown rules. “What you see is this virus is having a toll on the number of intimate occasions in the UK ” he said. Narasimhan added that young people in the UK were having “significantly” less sex than before the lockdown started on 23 March. He said increased anxiety had also led to less sex between established couples. On the first day of the UK lockdown  the government told people in new relationships they had to decide immediately whether to take their partnership to the next level and move in together or quarantine themselves separately. Jenny Harries  the deputy chief medical officer  said: “If the two halves of a couple are currently in separate households  ideally they should stay in those households. Harries said at the first daily Downing Street media briefing on 24 March: “The alternative might be that  for quite a significant period going forwards  they should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.” She added: “So perhaps  test really carefully your strength of feeling  stay with the household  either together or apart  but keep it that way while we go forward  because otherwise we will not all be working towards achieving our outcome.” Matt Hancock  the health secretary  added: “There you go. Make your choice and stick with it.” Reckitt Benckiser said it expected demand for condoms to recover when the lockdown ends  and said its condom factories would not scale back production. Narasimhan added that in China  the slowdown in sex during its lockdown had recovered and condom demand was back at the same levels as before the crisis. There have been concerns of a global condom shortage because strict lockdown rules in Malaysia  one of world’s top rubber producers and a major source of condoms  had made it difficult for condom factories to operate. Karex  the world’s largest condom producer which makes one in five of all condoms  has warned of a global condom shortage after closing three of its factories. The firm said it expects to produce 200m fewer condoms than usual from mid-March to mid-April. Goh Miah Kiat  Karex’s chief executive  told AFP earlier this month: “The world will definitely see a condom shortage.” “It’s challenging  but we are trying our best right now to do whatever we can. It is definitely a major concern – a condom is an essential medical device ” he said. Kiat added that the lack of supply could lead to serious societal and disease problems in developing countries as a large proportion of its condoms are supplied to governments and for distribution by aid programmes. The United Nations has warned that a lack of condoms could lead to “devastating” health and social problems across the world. “A shortage of condoms  or any contraceptive  could lead to an increase in unintended pregnancies  with potentially devastating health and social consequences for adolescent girls  women and their partners and families ” a spokesperson said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84c436634521868403767c71d82565bd39c9ce60/0_39_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03838141ce175bdb678b7d0a3b472dd9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df749602fb9d51aebfb1f3e5a65856e0a82e0555/0_58_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9be4b633311903fa9a271aa58a06548 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Reckitt+Benckiser%2CSexual+health%2CSex%2CBusiness%2CHealthcare+industry%2CHealth%2CLife+and+style%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CItaly https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/itv-considers-filming-love-island-in-cornwall-or-cancelling-series,media, ITV considers filming Love Island in Cornwall or cancelling series, Reality show has already been delayed  while soaps could soon run out of episodes, The reality show  which has been vital to ITV’s financial performance in recent years  has already been delayed from its traditional June start date owing to the coronavirus pandemic. ITV’s director of television  Kevin Lygo  said the production team had looked at filming Love Island in Cornwall later in the summer but had concerns that “making it in the UK would not be the same show”. He told a virtual session of the Edinburgh television festival that a final decision on whether to cancel the programme  which employs around 200 staff  would be made in the coming weeks. Lygo also suggested Love Island may not fit the national mood. “What signal might it be sending out if we’re doing a show where everyone is crammed together  slavering over each other  while the rest of world has been told not to go near anyone in the park? “We’re approaching the moment of ‘is it feasible?’  ‘will Mallorca open its doors to hundreds of production people?’  ‘will there have to be quarantine?’. We have to factor all that in. We’ll make a decision soon.” Lygo also said soap operas  which have already been broadcasting on a reduced schedule  would soon fall off air unless filming could resume. Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May and Coronation Street in June. He said Emmerdale had prepared a number of episodes that were “just two people talking”  which could theoretically be filmed in line with physical distancing rules if required. He said the channel was learning from its forthcoming Isolation Stories strand of 15-minute dramas  in which actors and their families have been filmed in their houses with directors sat outside. Lygo said a major issue was that insurers were refusing to cover the cost of production being halted if a cast or crew member catches coronavirus. “This summer  trust me  there’s going to be a lot of repeats on ” he said. Hit shows such as Britain’s Got Talent may also be axed owing to physical distancing rules  although the surprise hit The Masked Singer will film in the autumn even if an audience cannot be present. Lygo said he was concerned that although TV audiences had shot up  the increase was mainly for daytime shows and news programmes rather than peak-time programming. “You can see people’s habits are changing because they are discovering Netflix  Amazon  Disney+ and storing things up.” Lygo was asked what audiences would be seeing on TV in early 2021  given television production has ground to a halt in recent months. He replied: “They will be watching a repeat of Midsomer Murders  I can tell you that now in great confidence.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6307331898f2b5b4842cecc959fc1edf1337f1f3/198_0_3462_2080/master/3462.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=62f39a8720edbdf407ca397a81e6d3c9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=ITV+channel%2CLove+Island%2CCoronation+Street%2CEmmerdale%2CReality+TV%2CSoap+opera%2CITV+plc%2CITV%2CTelevision+industry%2CTelevision%2CMedia%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/stretched-hospitals-cannot-easily-redeploy-bame-staff-bosses-say,society, Virus pressure on NHS makes shielding BAME staff hard  say bosses, Hospital chiefs warn plan to protect minority ethnic medics could be difficult and divisive, The ongoing reassignment of those with underlying health problems and pregnant staffers will further complicate attempts to enact NHS England guidelines that BAME staff should be “risk-assessed” and redeployed where possible. However  growing numbers of hospitals are responding to the disproportionate number of minority ethnic people dying of Covid-19 by taking steps to help BAME personnel  including ensuring they have the protective equipment they need and are a priority to get tested. Hospitals  ambulance services and providers of mental healthcare in England were told by NHS chiefs on Wednesday that they should allow BAME staff to transfer to different roles if they wish. In new guidance to trust bosses  NHS England said that “on a precautionary basis we recommend employers should risk-assess staff at potentially greater risk and make appropriate arrangements accordingly”. NHS trusts bosses have begun discussing what they can do to help BAME staff reduce their risk. But there are major doubts about the viability of NHS England’s order  especially given the huge extra pressure the health service is under from treating so many people with Covid-19. One official said: “Redeployment of BAME staff is really tricky  because you have to make quite difficult decisions about certain people being on the frontline [dealing with Covid patients] and not others. It’s not like trusts are awash with staff they can start redeploying [to cover BAME colleagues]  especially as they have already had to redeploy people to staff Covid wards.” Dr Asif Munaf  a specialist registrar at Lincoln county hospital  said: “The guidance is at best vague as it does not outline the exact measures that will need to be taken. Does it mean BAME healthcare professionals will be redeployed to undertake more admin tasks  as everything is ‘high risk’ at present? “Secondly  it will be impossible to enact as an already skeleton service of doctors and nurses cannot afford to have BAME colleagues moved away from the frontline  especially with almost half of all UK doctors and a quarter of all nurses coming from BAME backgrounds.” He also warned the guidance would lead to huge variations in practice as trusts took different interpretations and said that it showed “the disconnect between those writing up official guidance and those in charge of enacting”. Trusts where as many as half their staff are from BAME backgrounds cautioned that they would find it particularly challenging to allow widespread reassignment. An official at one such trust said: “Hospital bosses are very worried about this very high death rate among BAME staff. But it’s not obvious exactly what we can do. If you have a high proportion of BAME workers  how do you provide normal care if a substantial number of them move away from their usual roles? It’s difficult.” However  at the four hospitals run by Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London  where 52% of staff are minority ethnic  “PPE helpers” who go round the wards ensuring that staff are using their personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly are particularly focusing on BAME workers. The trust is also ensuring that 52% of the tests for coronavirus now being offered to their staff are undertaken by minority ethnic staff. It has also urged BAME staff in a letter this week to raise any concerns about how their usual working environment is affecting their level of risk and pledged to take action. Dr Ramesh Mehta  the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin  said the key was testing for comorbidities in BAME staff and making sure they had the correct PPE. The NHSE advice had been interpreted wrongly  he added. “The wording could have been better. They should have said these people should be screened and if they are fit they should be allowed to work.” Unions welcomed the NHS England guidance and the move to assess BAME staff. Dr Chaand Nagpaul  the British Medical Association council chair  said: “BAME doctors and healthcare workers have done and continue to play an absolutely crucial role in our health service and in the fight against Covid-19. The NHS has a duty of care as an employer to protect its staff from harm and those that are at greater risk of serious infection. “As such  those healthcare workers at high risk can be redeployed to areas where they are less at risk or work remotely – in any case they will still be providing a vital service to the NHS which still needs to provide wider healthcare.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c73b7153dd3b5d72e502892cb16e8682136583/658_651_2797_1680/master/2797.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=081bec2fcfa8b84b79da1fbb303e51a6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CHealth+policy%2CHospitals%2CDoctors%2CNursing%2CMidwifery%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites,world, British BAME Covid-19 death rate 'more than twice that of whites', IFS report says number of UK deaths looks disproportionate in most ethnic minority groups, The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100 000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However  unlike previous analysis  the IFS research  published on Friday  strips out the role of age  gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Ross Warwick  a research economist at IFS and co-author of the report said: “When you account for the fact that most minority groups are relatively young overall  the number of deaths looks disproportionate in most ethnic minority groups. There is unlikely to be a single explanation here and different factors may be more important for different groups. For instance  while black Africans are particularly likely to be employed in key worker roles which might put them at risk  older Bangladeshis appear vulnerable on the basis of underlying health conditions.” Accounting for differences in age  sex and geography  the IFS found deaths of British black Africans background to be 3.5 times those of the white British population and British Pakistani deaths to be 2.7 times as high. Examining the possible reasons  it says that a third of all working-age Black Africans are employed in key worker roles  50% more than the share of the White British population. Additionally it says Pakistani  Indian and Black African men are respectively 90%  150% and 310% more likely to work in healthcare than white British men. Two-thirds of British Bangladeshi men over the age of 60 have a long-term health condition that would put them at particular risk from infection  while underlying health conditions are also especially prevalent among older people of a Pakistani or black Caribbean background  according to the report. Concerns have been growing about the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on black  Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people since figures published earlier this month showed that 35% of almost 2 000 Covid-19 patients in intensive care units in England  Wales and Northern Ireland were non-white  compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales  according to the 2011 census. Fears were fuelled by the fact that the first 10 doctors with the virus reported to have died were also BAME. After the head of the British Medical Association told the Guardian an inquiry was necessary to get to the bottom of the disparities  the government obliged a week later  although it has yet to reveal the terms of reference or timescale. Further statistics showing up disparities have since come to light. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally  63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian  according to the Health Service Journal. While cultural practices and genetics have been mooted as possible explanations for the disparities  higher levels of social deprivation have also been mooted as a cause and the IFS warns that some ethnic groups look more likely than others to suffer economically from the lockdown. Professor Lucinda Platt  from LSE and report co-author said: “There are striking differences in economic vulnerability between ethnic groups. Bangladeshi men are four times as likely as White British men to have jobs in shutdown industries  with Pakistani men nearly three times as likely; and household savings are lower than average among Black Africans  Black Caribbeans and Bangladeshis. By contrast Indians and the largely foreign-born Other White group do not seem to be facing disproportionate economic risks.” Dr Zubaida Haque  deputy director of the Runnymede Trust  praised the report and said it was important it recognised different ethnic groups have different socio-economic factors affecting them. “It is bringing into sharp relief the health and economic inequalities among ethnic minorities  which Runnymede trust have been saying is absolutely critical to understanding why some ethnic minority groups are bearing the brunt of Covid-19 ” she said. “But I think we need to go a step further and say it’s not enough to just observe and recognise that. The government needs to think about what more it can do  right now  on top of the review it commissioned  to buffer the health and economic vulnerabilities that ethnic minorities are much more exposed to.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb06dd987babc640ed2911a4d81b13724bda5bac/74_0_3326_1996/master/3326.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33f759046505fd97e30c33bc08be29e7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7d606fac8df9d3b134f93078304b87d0c4101/0_336_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ec23362e91075ec223418520e8f51a7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf536927794e454aa48b929b5d9a323f888b95f9/0_50_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5984f0b64436e8c5bd2f8f006f0664ff https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CRace%2CInequality%2CPopulation%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/01/historic-england-launches-coronavirus-lockdown-photography-project,artanddesign, Historic England launches lockdown photography project, People are asked to share their images of life under lockdown to ‘record history’, The week-long project  which was launched by Historic England on Wednesday and runs until Tuesday 5 May  encourages people to share images that reveal how they are dealing with lockdown  self-isolation and social distancing. Ten artists  including Scottee  based in Southend on Sea  and photographers Chloe Dewe Mathews  based in St Leonards-on-Sea  and Coralie Datta  based in Leeds  have also been asked to participate and they will produce “special images”. 100 of the submitted photographs and images will be inducted into the Historic England Archive. Claudia Kenyatta  the director of regions at Historic England  said the project was a chance to “record history” and “create a unique time capsule for the future” during one of the most extraordinary moments in living memory. She said: “We want people to show us their experiences of lockdown  how places local to them have transformed  communities have come together  and life has changed for us all. “These challenging times are encouraging us all to pause and reflect upon our relationship with our surroundings. We hope this project inspires creativity and reflection  allowing the public create a unique time capsule for the future.” The final selection of images will be made up of 50 of the most “evocative  informative and inspiring” images submitted by the public and 50 works from the contemporary artists  which will be catalogued by the Historic England Archive and be available online. It is the first time the British public has been asked to contribute to the archive  which contains more than 12m photographs taken since 1939  when the social research organisation Mass Observation collected accounts of everyday life during wartime. These diaries are still held in archive storage and Mass Observation’s work has been praised for touching “the parts that other archives cannot reach” by drawing an anthropologist’s gaze on the British people. Founded in 1937  Mass Observation “sought to bridge the gap between how the media represented public opinion and what ordinary people actually felt and thought”  according to the historian Benjamin Jones. In 2013  the Photographers’ Gallery in London put on an exhibition of material selected from the Mass Observation archive  which the Guardian critic Sean O’Hagan said showed the anthropologists to be “left-leaning and optimistic  but with a tendency to view the working-class as a kind of exotic species to be studied under an anthropological microscope”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab633c0645d8aca4fd06b28741007de37c309c6b/0_236_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=659acda7c66b7e9bc39734588b24ccdf https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e733d25950c038197dc74b490c71229d71299ce/0_0_669_1000/master/669.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37e6c7377aabbb207b4e2da86012dbcd https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Art%2CArt+and+design%2CPhotography%2CCulture https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

Among his most successful hits were Peace Train  Morning Has Broken  Father and Son  and Wild World. His conversion to Islam came after he almost died from tuberculosis in 1969 and in a near-drowning in the sea in California in 1976. After a long period reflecting on spirituality and faith  he gave up his music career  auctioned all his guitars for charity and devoted himself to running Islamic schools for children. In 2006 he released a new album under the name of Yusuf  and his most recent album  A Laughing Apple  appeared in 2017 under the name Yusuf/Cat Stevens. In the BBC reflections  he reads from the Qur’an and other holy texts and performs his own songs. In the first 10-minute reflection  to be broadcast on Friday  he says: “Humans  as far as we know  are the only earthly creatures who have to live with the knowledge of their own mortality. Now  for anyone with a mind  it’s hard not to question the reason for this  or to contemplate what might be beyond the final wall we must all climb one day.” In the second talk  he promises to discuss “how near-death came to wake me up and begin my journey in search of meaning”.

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/pick-up-the-phone-to-loved-ones-urges-man-after-grandfathers-suicide,uk-news, Warning over 'hidden effect of coronavirus' after grandfather's suicide, ‘Pick up the phone to loved ones’  urges grandson after Dennis Ward’s death, James Parnaby said his grandfather’s death was one of the “hidden effects of coronavirus” in a tribute posted on Facebook that described Dennis Ward as the “life and soul at family parties”. He said his grandfather loved betting on the horses and entertaining those around him with stories. “So  when I woke up to a call from my dad last night to say that ‘your grandad has committed suicide’  it came as a huge shock and has hit the family like a tonne of bricks and will be hard to understand for us all.” Ward grew up in Coventry but spent much of his life in south Birmingham with his wife of 60 years  Valerie Ward. He had worked at Jaguar Land Rover in Castle Bromwich  a village in the West Midlands. The family confirmed to the Guardian that Ward had died at his Kings Norton home on Saturday. “If you are reading this  I ask you all today  to just pick up the phone to your parents  grandparents  friends or anyone vulnerable to check up on them and ask if they are OK and are coping. I never got the chance to speak to him as I thought he would be OK and would see him on the other side ” Parnaby said. Parnaby has set up a fundraising page for the charity Mind in memory of Ward  which has collected nearly £2 000. He hoped the funds would help raise awareness about mental health issues  particularly during the current crisis. “If you could kindly donate anything  whether it’s 5p or £50 it would mean the world to us. This great charity help people with any sort of mental health issues. The coronavirus pandemic is having a huge impact on our mental health ” he wrote. Earlier this month  Prof Rory O’Connor  an expert leading the UK’s assessment of the coronavirus outbreak’s psychological impact  said people who feel trapped and lonely during the coronavirus lockdown must be swiftly identified and given the help they need. Police have recorded early signs of an increase in suicides and attempted suicides during lockdown. • In the UK and Ireland  Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/boots-to-provide-help-for-domestic-abuse-victims-coronavirus-lockdown,business, Boots to provide help for domestic abuse victims, Pharmacies to provide safe spaces during coronavirus lockdown after rise in calls, Multiple support services for domestic abuse have reported a surge in calls to helplines since the lockdown was imposed  while the Metropolitan police said it was making an average of about 100 arrests a day for offences linked to abuse in the home. Many victims who are now unable to seek help while at home trapped with their abusers will still be expected to shop for food and medicine  and there have been calls for safe space initiatives to be introduced in supermarkets and more pharmacies. The domestic abuse charity Hestia is overseeing a safe space model in consultation rooms at most of the 2 400 Boots pharmacies across the country to provide access to support for anyone experiencing domestic abuse. People who wish to use the safe space consultation room need to ask at the pharmacy counter. Once inside  they will find the 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline  the men’s advice line and phone numbers for services specific to Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland. There will be signposting to download Hestia’s mobile app Bright Sky  which provides support and information to anyone who may be in an abusive relationship. Lyndsey Dearlove  the head of Hestia’s UK SAYS NO MORE campaign  said: “While lockdown and social distancing measures continue  it is restricting victims of domestic abuse reaching out to their friends  family and co-workers for support. “We know there is an increased level of uncertainty for people looking to escape an abusive relationship. Self-isolation offers a new method of control over victims making it very difficult for them to seek support. “We recognise that key workers in pharmacies hold a unique position within the community as a single point of contact for victims. By creating this safe space in Boots pharmacies  we hope many will be able to safely access support while following government guidelines. “We hope more pharmacies will follow Boots UK’s lead and join the Safe Space initiative. Although we are in a period of lockdown and isolation  our message to victims is domestic abuse services are open and we can help you.” Hestia said it had already seen a 47% increase in victims reaching out for information and support on its Bright Sky app during the lockdown period. The president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society  Sandra Gidley  said: “During the pandemic  when options for survivors and victims are even more limited than usual  pharmacies can provide the safe environment needed to get support. The trust that the public have in pharmacies make them an ideal place to access help and take a step away from harm towards a better future.” Duncan Rudkin  the chief executive of the General Pharmaceutical Council  which regulates pharmacies in Britain  said: “We are encouraging all pharmacies to consider becoming a Safe Space  to help people experiencing domestic abuse access vital support they may need. “Pharmacies are in the frontline in supporting the healthcare needs of patients and the public during the Covid-19 pandemic in the community  and are one of the few places that are open to people who may need help.” • The 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline can be reached on 0808 2000 247  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6b245f5f0ef061605ce2b81886b99c9a5ca58dc/0_40_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=701c17380eea1573e1b3f5af0cdb1e2c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Retail+industry%2CDomestic+violence%2CSociety%2CWomen%2CUK+news%2CCrime https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/cia-pushes-back-at-trump-efforts-to-link-coronavirus-to-chinese-laboratories,world, US intelligence agencies under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs, Senior Trump administration figures said to be demanding evidence on virus’s origins, Intelligence analysts fear Donald Trump is looking for propaganda to be used in the escalating blame game over whether China covered up the crisis or even generated the virus in its laboratories. Trump has claimed that China’s handling of the pandemic is proof that Beijing “will do anything they can” to make him lose his re-election bid in November and told Reuters he was considering different forms of retaliation. The Washington Post reported that high-level meetings were under way in the White House to discuss options  including suing for compensation  which would involve stripping China of “sovereign immunity” or cancelling debt obligations to China. The US secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  has repeatedly suggested that the coronavirus could have come from a virology laboratory in Wuhan  after cables surfaced from early 2018 in which US diplomats expressed concern about safety standards at the facility. The office of the director of national intelligence said in a statement on Thursday that it had concluded that the virus was “not manmade or genetically modified”  but said that officials were still examining whether the origins of the pandemic could be traced to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab. “The intelligence community [IC] also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified ” said the statement. “The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.” Most scientists who have studied the genetics of the coronavirus provided by China say that the overwhelming probability is that it leapt jumped from animal to human in a non-laboratory setting  as was the case with previous pandemics. In recent days Trump and his allies have sharpened their rhetoric on China  accusing it of failing to act swiftly enough to stop the spread of the virus or sound the alarm about the outbreak. Those reported as pushing US intelligence agencies to lend credence to the theory that the virus was created in Chinese labs include the US secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  the deputy national security adviser  Matthew Pottinger  and Richard Grenell  the acting director of national intelligence. In numerous TV interviews  Pompeo has said China suppressed information on the virus and withheld key facts from the World Health Organization  and he has hinted that he believes the virus originated in Chinese laboratories. But the suggestion that intelligence agencies are being put under pressure to produce evidence represents a step up from such comments. Such a finding would turn the international disaster into something akin to biological warfare  or a lab accident of catastrophic proportions. More than 1 million people have been infected and more than 60 000 have died in the US from the virus  adding political urgency to Trump’s desire to shift blame for the crisis on to China. China has been resisting an international inquiry into the origins of the outbreak in Wuhan and  under pressure  says it is a matter for the WHO to investigate. The proposal is unlikely to mollify Trump  who has condemned the WHO as Chinese-centric and has suspended US funding from the UN agency pending a review. Chris Patten  the former governor general of Hong Kong and a long-term critic of Chinese efforts to control democracy in the former colony  has joined the calls for an international inquiry  accusing China of initially covering up the outbreak. The calls for an inquiry have been strongest in Australia  leading to a diplomatic confrontation between the Australian prime minister  Scott Morrison  and the Chinese ambassador to Australia  Cheng Jingye. The calls have also been supported by Winston Peters  New Zealand’s foreign minister. Peters said: “It is very hard to conceive  no matter what country it is  of there not being a desire from every country around the world – including the country of origin – for an investigation to find out how this happened.” Jingye has warned of a Chinese boycott of Australian goods and services. Beijing has been caught in a bind  with its diplomats sometimes saying it is not even clear whether the virus originated in China  contending that it is a legitimate matter for inquiry by scientists  but then rejecting an international inquiry into the source of the outbreak. Chinese diplomats distinguish between an international inquiry  which they say is likely to be a political blame game  and a dispassionate examination by WHO scientists. Critics of China counter that the WHO’s record shows it has neither the will nor the investigative powers required to look deep into the entrails of the Chinese Communist party and expose any cover-up. The WHO is dependent on the cooperation of its member states for access and has no mechanism to punish countries that keep its officials in the dark. Proposals have been floated for the WHO to be given the power to impose sanctions on countries that are not transparent with it  but this proposal would need to pass the WHO’s general assembly  and would require nation states handing over a degree of sovereignty to a multilateral body. The Chinese ambassador to the UK  Liu Xiaoming  delivered a lengthy rebuttal to the prospect of an international inquiry last week. “You’re talking about independent investigation. It’s up to the WHO. We support the WHO. We believe we should play by international norms and international rules  not by some other countries’ rules. Some other country even sues China at its local court. It’s absurd ”he said in remarks to the Asia Society in London. “This is not the first time that some politicians want to play world police. This is not the era of ‘gunboat diplomacy’. This is not the era when China was still in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This is the third decade of the 21st century. Those people cannot understand it. They think they still live in the old days when they can bully China and the world. If the WHO does not act their way  they stop their support and criticise the WHO to be ‘China-centric’. That’s simply not right. “So we are calling for international cooperation. That’s the only weapon and only way out to win this battle against the virus. Not by scapegoating  not by playing games  not by politicising the virus  not by spreading a political virus.” A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: “Coronavirus is a global challenge and it’s vital that countries come together to tackle this shared threat. The Foreign Secretary has been clear that  in time  we will need to learn lessons and ask rigorous questions about why this outbreak happened  why it couldn’t be stopped earlier and what can be done to prevent another outbreak in future. This is something that we will look at with all of our international partners.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f746c0fed65035c7a78f5e1b4008427753c2249c/0_54_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=281b0492638126f2bf64a75fdd264c57 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Trump+administration%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CChina%2CCIA%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CAsia+Pacific%2CUS+politics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/life-with-a-beijing-covid-19-quarantine-handler-coronavirus,world, Ms Du  door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler, China’s coronavirus measures are often seen as tough and effective - but how well do they really work?, She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis  asking me to “please cooperate” with the rules. If I open my door  equipped with a sensor  to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery  she immediately calls and tells me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan  I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station  perhaps checking the spelling of my name  someone from the health department asking about my travel history  or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to “spit wherever you please”. The calls and questions  politely made  are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last. In the last few weeks  I find that my friends and family elsewhere have started to look at China and its ability to enforce coronavirus measures with a mixture of awe and envy. Many also find it disconcerting. In addition to an army of local residents like Du  the tools of China’s surveillance state help track residents who may pose a health risk. What strikes me  however  is how confused and sometimes absurd the enforcement of these measures can be. To the outside world  China’s lockdowns and strict quarantine requirements are evidence of its vast state power and draconian tendencies. But on the ground  the implementation is often bureaucratic and bumbling and the measures more tedious and overbearing than intimidating. A week into my quarantine  I was told to start filling in a daily sheet on whether or not I have experienced a cough  sore throat  fatigue  runny nose  aches  diarrhoea or vomiting that day - ticking yes or no for each symptom. A day later  Du said I would also need to submit my temperature five times a day - every three hours from 9am to 9pm. I negotiated the check-ins down to the original twice a day. There are loopholes and inconsistencies. A friend in what is called “centralised quarantine” at a designated hotel  mainly for those who have come from overseas  has snuck out several times  wandering the halls and going to the building’s roof. Other apartment compounds have asked returning residents to simply promise not to go out. In some cases  the processes appear to be well-planned but little effort has been made to communicate to people what will happen. In March  my husband was put into centralised quarantine and delivered to a hotel with nothing more than a list of instructions in Chinese on how to report his temperature and when he could open his windows. There were no details about how he would get meals or water. “For any questions  contact the work group ” it said  without listing any contact information. Both residents and the people in charge of their quarantines are at the mercy of vague policies  announced with little warning. In one of our more personal exchanges  Du said my quarantine would be extended by seven extra days. She listened patiently while I had a minor meltdown  demanding to know how they could arbitrarily lock me at home for three weeks. “I understand how you feel  and a lot of people feel the way you do ” she said  promising she would take it up with her superiors. After 14 days of working from home  doing workout videos and cooking elaborate meals for myself  I finally got a chance to see Du. She was younger than I expected  dressed in a face mask  gloves and a red armband identifying herself as a community volunteer. She was with two medics in full hazmat suits who had come to test whether or not I have the virus. As I squatted down in front of my door so a medic could swab my throat  Du filmed the exchange on her mobile phone. Later that day  Beijing officials announced the city was downgrading its emergency response level. I sent Du and others several messages highlighting the part of the press conference that seemed to mean I was no longer subject to an extra week of quarantine. No one responded except to say they had not received any directive yet. The next morning  a man came to take the sensor off my door.

Of the 44 European countries to have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the virus  21 had started easing some of them and a further 11 were planning to do so soon  said Hans Kluge  regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe. Kluge warned that all governments must remain extremely circumspect. “As I have said before  this virus is unforgiving ” he said. “We must remain vigilant  persevere and be patient – and ready to ramp up measures again as and when needed.” There was  though  encouraging news from the Czech Republic and Denmark  where phased exits from strict lockdowns implemented early in the pandemic are under way. In Denmark  daycare facilities and schools began reopening two weeks ago  followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. “There are no signs at all that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection ” said Christian Wejse  a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. “At least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern  but I can’t see that at all.” The Czech health minister  Adam Vojt?ch  said the country’s number of new cases had been below 100 for the past eight consecutive days and also reported that a staggered reopening of shops and services had not so far led to a surge in infections. “So far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations ” Vojt?ch said. “We will proceed with caution  gradually in the upcoming waves  and I believe we are on a good path.” Proceeding cautiously  Germany on Thursday said places of worship  museums  gardens  zoos  playgrounds and monuments could reopen over the coming days after the chancellor  Angela Merkel  met the heads of the 16 German states. But the federal government and state leaders postponed decisions on whether to reopen all schools and kindergartens and said physical distancing rules would stay in place at least until 10 May  with no further relaxations to be decided before 6 May. Merkel said reopening cafes and restaurants at this stage would be problematic because of the difficulty of checking whether “people around one table are from one family  or from different households”. She said Germany’s goal currently remained to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly. “We don’t have any medication  we don’t have any vaccine against the virus and ... therefore  the goal will always be to slow down the virus ” Merkel said  adding that Germany had so far been “successful in achieving this goal”. Germany began easing its lockdown last week  when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing  but Merkel and government advisers have expressed serious concerns about the dangers of going to far  too fast  with the risk of the infection rate stating to rise again. In Spain  where the daily death toll fell to its lowest in six weeks on Thursday  the health minister announced time slots for specific outdoor activities  in an effort to avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March. Salvador Illa said that except in smaller towns with fewer than 5 000 inhabitants  people would be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and 8pm until 11pm  while people who needed carers or were over 70 could be out from 10am to midday and from 7pm until 8pm. Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. “We need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice ” Illa said. “We got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There’s no other way.” France categorised each of its 95 départements as either red  amber or green according to its risk level  with much of the north and east of the country – including Paris – red  and much of the west and south-west green. Based on infection rate and intensive care bed capacity  the designation will be updated daily until 7 May  when a decision will be made on how fast each will be able to come out of lockdown on 11 May. The country’s environment minister  Élisabeth Borne  said the government will contribute €50 per person towards bicycle repairs from 11 May  as part of a package of measures to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads. Under pressure from some regional politicians to lift Europe’s longest lockdown sooner  Italy’s prime minister also said the country’s gradual return to normality must be carefully coordinated and based strictly on scientific advice  if it did not want to see a surge in infections. “I’ll say this clearly  at the risk of appearing unpopular ” Giuseppe Conte told parliament on Thursday. “The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... We are still in this pandemic.” The economic devastation wrought by Covid-19 on the continent  however  is already apparent. After Germany on Wednesday said it faced its worst recession since 1949  France  Italy and Spain revealed equally dire figures on Thursday. France and Italy officially fell into recession following historic first-quarter economic declines  while Spain warned of an annual contraction “unprecedented in modern history”. The European Central Bank head  Christine Lagarde  said the crisis threatened “an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peacetime”. South Korea  meanwhile  once one of the hardest-hit countries in a pandemic that has so far infected more than 3.2 million people worldwide and killed nearly 230 000  reported no new cases for the first time since the disease was detected there  boosting hopes of an eventual return to normality. An aggressive test-and-trace strategy and widespread social distancing had allowed the country to bring the spread of the virus under control  President Moon Jae-in said. “This is the strength of South Korea and its people ” he declared on Thursday. Elsewhere  the virus continued to advance. Cases in Russia surged past 100 000 on Thursday as the country recorded its largest daily increase. The country is now the centre of the outbreak in Europe  but a relatively low death total of 1 073 prompted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to say it had avoided a catastrophic “Italian scenario”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d261f3bf566a508cc7d2927251a7b3d87d63557/0_182_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e6aa81f3da2b8400a5d0793021226704 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a7f65c3576b72b12bd856dba5c20884ca26ea3/0_62_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=948a885c3314d5e62f75323f152ece24 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDenmark%2CCzech+Republic%2CSouth+Korea%2CWorld+news%2CEurope https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/new-york-police-funeral-home-stored-bodies-ice-trucks,world, Police find bodies stored in rented trucks at overwhelmed New York funeral home, Investigators found Brooklyn facility had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses on ice  as funeral homes struggle in state amid coronavirus, Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses  according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official  who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation  spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Andrew T Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odors. The home was able to obtain a larger  refrigerated truck later in the day  the official said. Workers suited up in protective gear could be seen in the afternoon transferring bodies into the refrigerated truck. A person who answered the phone at the funeral home hung up without speaking. Subsequent calls went to voicemail  which was full. New York City funeral homes have struggled in the city since late March. The city has set up temporary morgues. Hospitals used refrigerated tractor trailers to cart away multiple bodies at a time  sometimes loading them in public view on the sidewalk. Crematoriums have been backed up. Funeral directors across the city have pleaded for help as they have run out of space. The NYPD notified the state department of health  which oversees funeral homes  about the situation at the Andrew T Cleckley Funeral Home. It did not respond to an email seeking comment. The Brooklyn borough president  Eric Adams  went to the scene on Wednesday evening. He told the Daily News  “While this situation is under investigation  we should not have what we have right now  with trucks lining the streets filled with bodies.” He said “it was people who walked by who saw some leakage and detected an odor coming from a truck”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d347f81673d5c6c890224610592f09a52481c84d/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94d450dfb71fcd0b5f5392959c4c349f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd51dfe148fec5769442f81f101a03d26df52628/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00ae0c5568ee062458a4721a8c3ca268 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acb060bb9fd5654d192a280c9eec4c7c8a523ff/0_40_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46e7cfd6549f890ac77d642bff37ea60 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1301d7b23ac0ace5e0f4fb75ac535e9cb20ab8/0_32_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c06e13fbba60b4732a34a39321a99c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9f5b1473a9ae9e4cd4b1d3b405f56b5392bf10/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=928dd5039fba60b0a5086580c8f37f12 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNew+York%2CUS+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/brazil-manaus-coronavirus-mass-graves,world, 'Utter disaster': Manaus fills mass graves as Covid-19 hits the Amazon, Emergency measures pile pain on to mourning families as coronavirus tears through the ill-prepared jungle-flanked cityby Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro and Fabiano Maisonnave in Manaus, On Sunday 140 bodies were laid to rest in Manaus  the jungle-flanked capital of Amazonas state. On Saturday  98. Normally the figure would be closer to 30 – but these are no longer normal times. “It’s madness – just madness ” said Gilson de Freitas  a 30-year-old maintenance man whose mother  Rosemeire Rodrigues Silva  was one of 136 people buried there last Tuesday as local morticians set yet another grim daily record. Freitas – who believes his mother contracted Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital following a stroke – recalled watching in despair as her remains were lowered into a muddy trench alongside perhaps 20 other coffins. “They were just dumped there like dogs ” he said. “What are our lives worth now? Nothing.” The city’s mayor  Arthur Virgílio  pleaded for urgent international help. “We aren’t in a state of emergency – we’re well beyond that. We are in a state of utter disaster … like a country that is at war – and has lost ” he said. “It’s tragic surrealism ... I can’t stop thinking about Gabriel García Márquez when I think about the situation Manaus is facing.” The coronavirus appears to have reached this isolated  riverside metropolis of more than 2 million people on 11 March  imported by a 49-year-old woman who had flown in from London. Six weeks later it is taking a terrible toll  with gravediggers so overworked that two men were this week forced to bury their own father. “Manaus is in a race against time to avoid becoming the Brazilian version of Guayaquil ” one local newspaper  A Crítica  warned last week in reference to the Ecuadorian city where bodies have been left rotting in the streets and thousands are feared to have died. With more than 100 people dying each day and Manaus’s overwhelmed authorities performing nighttime burials  many fear it is already too late. City officials say they expect to bury up to 4 500 people in the next month alone. Funeral homes have warned they will run out of wooden coffins by this weekend. In Parque Tarumã – Manaus’s biggest cemetery – excavators have carved out mass graves called “trincheiras” – trenches – in which the dead were being stacked in three-high piles until a revolt from mourning families saw the practice halted. “It’s chaos in there ” said Freitas  whose 58-year-old mother was consigned to the trenches last week. “She spent her whole life working … she paid all of her taxes. She deserved more. We all do.” Edmar Barros  a local photographer who has been documenting the burials  said he had never seen anything similar. “It’s absurd what is happening here ” he said. “It’s a situation of just devastating sadness.” Emergency and health services in Manaus are also buckling under the strain  with ambulances roaming for up to three hours in search of hospitals with space to admit the patients they have collected. Gruesome video footage has emerged from hospitals showing corridors lined with corpses shrouded in body bags and sheets. Another video shows an unconscious patient with his head wrapped inside a ventilator hood improvised from a large plastic bag. “There’s a shortage of mechanical ventilators  of oxygen  of staff  of stretchers. Everything is lacking ” said Dr Domício Magalhães Filho  the technical director of the ambulance service  Samu. Experts and officials say multiple factors explain the intensity of the catastrophe affecting the Amazon region’s biggest city. One is that the coronavirus epidemic has struck at the tail end of the rainy season  when respiratory illnesses are rife and hospitals already stretched. Another is that Manaus’s chronically underfunded health service was poorly equipped and understaffed even before medical workers began contracting Covid-19 themselves. But many also blame corruption and the government’s failure to effectively implement containment measures once Covid-19 was detected. Only on 23 March – 10 days after the first case was confirmed – did the state governor declare a state of emergency  ordering all non-essential businesses to close. “We took too long to ask people to stay at home ” said Leonardo Steiner  the archbishop of Manaus  which is a four-hour flight north of São Paulo. Even now  with the death toll soaring  social distancing is being flouted in some areas on the city’s outskirts  with huge queues outside banks and locals refusing to wear masks or remain at home. “Part of the city seems like it couldn’t care less – it’s as if nothing is happening ” said Barros  the photographer. The mayor admitted he had failed to keep people indoors but said Brazil’s president  Jair Bolsonaro  should shoulder much of the blame for deliberately undermining such measures. “We don’t have hurricanes here. We don’t have tsunamis. Here the tsunami was having disregarded … social isolation.” “It saddens me to know these lives could have been saved and weren’t saved  in part because Brazil’s main leader … said it was OK to go out ” Virgílio added. Marcia Castro  a Harvard University demographer who specialises in public health in the Brazilian Amazon  said it was unrealistic to expect people to follow health ministry advice when 43% of residents didn’t even have access to water to wash their hands. “What this pandemic is doing is throwing wide open the inequalities that have existed for so long ” said Castro  whose studies suggest Manaus’s health system will collapse further in the coming days. Of the 5 000-plus Covid deaths officially confirmed in Brazil only 274 have been recorded in Manaus. But the recent surge in burials leaves no doubt the real total is far higher. Twenty-four hours after Rosemeire Silva’s interment  another local woman  53-year-old Amália Brandão Ribeiro  was rushed unconscious to hospital suffering Covid symptoms – in the front seat of an Uber taxi  since no ambulances were available. Ribeiro’s frenzied arrival was caught on camera – with weeping relatives pleading for help before her lifeless body was eventually hauled inside by staff. “They never even brought a trolley ” said Paula Ribeiro  her daughter. Ribeiro was declared dead soon after  with the cause listed as “unknown”. But it was two days before her children could bury her at the Parque Tarumã – one of 128 funerals that day. The confusion was such that officials initially released a man’s corpse to her family before the mistake was realized. Freitas said he knew little of the ailment that had robbed him of his mother. “It comes from China  doesn’t it?” he said vaguely on Tuesday as President Bolsonaro sparked outrage by shrugging his shoulders at the country’s dead. “All of us are afraid because we don’t know what tomorrow might bring ” Freitas said. “Today we’re alive. Tomorrow we just don’t know.” Additional reporting by Daylla Kobosque , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd5ea50e60491a4dfca01158bddf140a51f1e1f/0_314_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1104139cea02ea36a7052f1bb25c2ef6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ecf91eaa0756068dd5965075afe7655be13520/0_0_2490_1704/master/2490.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f6cc416af0a5e63dc49048f855cbacd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdcdb1ea7439abb6fee539d9ecabd9d2d8ef42d6/0_0_2462_3500/master/2462.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=08d802a21b772126cc5f359768a10907 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2430216210c72e62fa42357cd40066e71870674/0_58_3073_1845/master/3073.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04d7eb17f7ac4fef7f3e3125b86333c9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5d82f6c7871d25f39ee79807b15a4f00e25313f/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a479c9c072cc3a151503b7442ac02dea https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brazil%2CWorld+news%2CAmericas%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/brazil-rio-coronavirus-great-hardship-bolsonaro,world, Bolsonaro faces calls to change tack on Covid-19 as Rio heads for ‘great hardship’, Rio’s health secretary said intensification of containment measures was only way to avoid surge in deaths and social turmoil, Jair Bolsonaro has sabotaged efforts to impose effective social distancing measures by flouting his own health ministry’s recommendations  sacking his health minister and attacking Covid-19 “hysteria”. Asked about the rising death toll this week  the far-right populist sparked outrage by declaring: “So what?” But on Thursday Edmar Santos  the health secretary of Rio  Brazil’s third most populous state  said an intensification of containment measures – perhaps including some form of China-style lockdown – was the only way to avoid a dramatic surge in fatalities and social turmoil. “We are going to live through moments of great national hardship  the likes of which we’ve never experienced before ” Santos told the television network Globo. “We aren’t a country that has lived through major wars like countries in Europe. But we’ve all lost loved ones at some point. We’re going to experience big emotional problems  social problems in the coming days and  unfortunately  we’re going to see a big rise in the number of deaths.” According to official figures Covid-19 has so far claimed 5 466 lives in Brazil – 794 of them in Rio and 2 247 in neighbouring São Paulo. Santos said that if current trends continued about 1 800 people would die in Rio during May – although the number would “undoubtedly be higher” if authorities failed to slow the rate of transmission. But the secretary – who was himself diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier this month – admitted underreporting meant official figures did not capture the scale of the crisis. He believed Rio – which has a population of 17 million - actually had about 140 000 cases – more than 15 times the official number of under 9 000. A study published in the O Globo newspaper suggested the national figures were being similarly underestimated  with more than 1.2m likely infections  compared with the official figure of under 74 000. That would mean Brazil had more cases than the United States  so far the country worst hit by the pandemic  which has about 1 million. “The truth is this: if we don’t flatten the curve we will face chaos in May [and] a second round of chaos in June ” Santos warned  pointing to Italy  which suffered nearly 1 000 deaths on its most deadly day  in late March. In another interview Rio’s health chief said: “What we expect for the next three to four weeks is that Rio de Janeiro and Brazil will experience the same kind of collapse that Italy  Spain and the United States have seen.” The warnings came amid growing signs that efforts to keep Brazilians at home were faltering and with Brazil’s president facing mounting pressure to change his anti-scientific stance towards the pandemic. Flávio Dino  the leftist governor of Maranhão state  urged Bolsonaro to make an immediate address to the nation instructing citizens to remain at home. “Today we are at the cliff edge  on the cusp of total collapse which we need to avoid – and Bolsonaro is the main person responsible for avoiding this situation ” Dino told the news website UOL. Sérgio Moro  the popular justice minister who abandoned Bolsonaro’s government last week  tweeted: “Unfortunately  the number of coronavirus victims in Brazil is rising sharply. It is unclear how the pandemic will evolve. Take care!” The mayor of the crisis-stricken city of Manaus – where an average of 100 burials are being conducted each day – urged fellow mayors and governors to do what he admitted he had failed to do – convince people to stay at home. “What I can say to them is to insist on social isolation … We have to achieve this and reach a percentage [of isolation] that causes the curve to fall ” Arthur Virgílio told the Guardian. Virgílio accused Bolsonaro of offering Brazil’s 211 million citizens a false and dangerous choice between “freedom” and “the prison” of social isolation. “He is offering freedom  but it is a false freedom that could represent a kind of genocide … It’s obvious that this is not going to end well ” Virgílio said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9813ce1e5c45f3242b01f7071f2db6b6ddb2de2/0_94_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4af6d2618df15955ba2afbc7389dd49 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+de+Janeiro%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/no-end-in-sight-100000-crew-on-cruise-ships-stranded-at-sea-coronavirus,environment, Revealed: 100 000 crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis, Guardian investigation finds workers stranded on at least 50 ships with Covid-19 outbreaks  limited medical equipment  some without pay  and no end in sight, Around the world  more than 100 000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships  at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections  a Guardian investigation has found. They are shut out of ports and banned from air travel that would allow them to return to their homes. Many of these crew are quarantined in tiny cabins  and some have had their pay cut off. They have in effect become a nation of floating castaways  marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to Dubai port. Many of the crew have only minimal communication with the outside world  making their situations hard to scrutinise. But at least 17 cruise ship workers are confirmed to have died from suspected Covid-19  and dozens more have had to be evacuated from ships and taken to hospital  the Guardian found. “We all have family  we all want to go home ” said one crew member who has been isolating in his cabin onboard the MSC Seaview off South America for nearly a month  but is no longer being paid. The worker  who spoke via the internet and asked not to be named for fear of losing his job  said crew were initially allowed to move about the ship freely  but have been told to remain in their cabins since a worker who had already left the ship tested positive for Covid-19. “We have not received any information about when we’re going home or what they are doing to get crew members home ” said the worker. “We are just in the cabin like prisoners.” A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating  we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. “We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge  assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use. We’ve upgraded our menus  and are providing complimentary internet.” Most industry workers hail from developing countries such as the Philippines  Indonesia and India and generally earn between $1 000–$2 000 (£800- £1 600) a month for working seven days a week  according to Ross Klein  a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry. Documents seen by the Guardian show that at least one cruise line has stopped paying some workers who are trapped onboard. Those who died in April include two housekeeping staff  a bartender and a security guard who were evacuated from ships in Florida. An Italian ship’s doctor died in Brazil after being taken by ambulance from the Costa Fascinosa cruise ship  and an engine worker on the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer died in Uruguay after 128 of the 217 people onboard tested positive for coronavirus. Yet many nations  including the US  have baulked at providing even basic emergency services for these stranded crew members. “Some of these crews are in a no man’s land ” said John Hickey  a maritime lawyer. He said crew members did not have access to the rights afforded by their nations of citizenship  yet they were often outside the jurisdiction of the countries where their ships were sailing. Most of the cruise companies are registered in low-tax  low-regulation nations such as Panama or Liberia  with their ships flying the flags of territories such as the Bahamas or Bermuda  which are not prepared to care for thousands of sick crew. “It’s a big problem ” he said. “We are getting calls left and right. Crews are onboard  they’re not happy and they’re frightened.” As of 4 April  the US Coast Guard estimated that 93 000 crew members remained onboard ships in and around US waters alone. Tens of thousands more are on ships in other parts of the world  according to the Guardian’s analysis  which used the ship tracking site CruiseMapper and media reports to identify more than 50 ships that have had Covid-19 infections or confirmed exposures onboard. Cruises around the world were suspended on 14 March  yet many ports refused to let the ships dock long before that  meaning some crews have been stuck at sea for months. Cruise industry officials say they have been scrambling to repatriate crews that are not needed onboard during the shutdown  but port closures  travel bans and flight restrictions have made it extremely difficult. Some countries  including India  have almost completely sealed their borders  even to citizens. “The industry is committed to bringing passengers and crew home at its expense – without burdening governments ” the Cruise Line Industry Association said in a statement to the Guardian. “Flight restrictions and port closures have created some logistical challenges; however we are working through those as we speak. We are asking ports and governments around the world to allow these ships to come into port so that those onboard can make their way home safely and as quickly as possible.” Thousands of crew are sick or have been exposed to coronavirus. Outbreaks are raging in US waters  from the Miami coastline  where at least nine workers have been evacuated from the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas  to the docks of San Diego  where workers onboard the Disney Wonder have contracted coronavirus. In France  workers preparing to launch the new Celebrity Apex contracted Covid-19 even before the ship carried its first passengers. Some ships have medical supplies but few are equipped to handle full-blown outbreaks. All crew on the MSC Seaview are obliged to wear a mask and gloves onboard the cruise ship  which has basic medical equipment  a small emergency room and a laboratory. At least two doctors are caring for people on the vessel. “All crew members currently onboard are healthy and none have displayed any symptoms ” a spokesperson for MSC cruises said. “MSC Seaview has a full onboard medical centre equipped and staffed in line with the highest and most stringent international guidelines. We continue to conduct regular health and temperature checks to ensure their health.” The hundreds of crew members onboard the Ruby Princess ship  which departed from Australia on Thursday  marked their 30th day in quarantine on the ship on last week with a video thanking the medical workers who have cared for them. But the ships generally lack ventilators and other complicated medical equipment needed to treat Covid-19. In serious medical emergencies  passengers and crew on cruise ships are normally evacuated to a hospital on land for further care. Since the pandemic began  however  many countries are refusing to take them. , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/17/Sep/2018/25703364-a145-46b0-bcd0-bcd1dd5f571b-seascape-color-logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a7f65c3576b72b12bd856dba5c20884ca26ea3/0_62_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=948a885c3314d5e62f75323f152ece24 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58892d73450c088bb41dec9d358367a5e519b68b/0_0_4658_3073/master/4658.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=08114d2c2bc57eff3a12c9dcdb4759ad https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CCruises%2CTravel%2CUS+news%2CAustralia+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2COceans https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus,environment, ‘No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus, From the Galapagos to Dubai crew have been left marooned amid squabbles over who is responsible for their welfare, Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties  she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port. “It’s really scary  you don’t know how long it’s going to last ” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said  ‘can you get me some medicine  my head is going to explode’  they said  ‘there are people sicker than you  stay where you are’.” She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April  alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers  despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide. The ship is not an exception. Across the world  a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew. Nedeltcheva  who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria  may have been one of the lucky ones. Upwards of 100 000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships. Most have no communication with the outside world  and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian’s investigation  however  a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways  marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai. The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases  the Diamond Princess  was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated  Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria  which had just pulled into Southampton  were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard  according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider. In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas  from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida  that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances  according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald. Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises  which is owned by Royal Caribbean  is Julia Melim  a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms. The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land. A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe  healthy  cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.” The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected  but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships. “This accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally ” said the association in a statement. “It is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members  as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.” Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem  given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship  the Ruby Princess  which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March  has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus. “Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries ” said a 4 April CDC order  barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.” Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew  workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic  however  the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases. “They are basically getting no healthcare ” says Michael Winkleman  the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call  no one comes.” Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies  including Carnival and Royal Caribbean  are headquartered in the US  the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia  meaning they pay almost no US taxes. Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda  which allows them to avoid strict safety standards  labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US. US Coast Guard officials said in a memo on 29 March that outbreaks aboard ships are straining the rescue and medical resources in the Florida region. The bulletin  first obtained by the Miami Herald  asked ships carrying more than 50 people to prepare to provide their own medical care to those onboard for extended periods. “Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas  particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged  it added. Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo  saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships. “The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis  and we in the Bahamas  facing the same global crisis  are doing what we can to provide support ” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.” On some ships  crew members say they are being treated well  and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge  currently floating in the Bahamas  distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers. On other ships  the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out  and that they were forced to pay for internet time. Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line  according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian  are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating  we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge  assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.” A former crew member for another major cruise liner  Krista Thomas  who lives in Vancouver  has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home. She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods  and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home. “They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; they’re taking care of parents and in-laws ” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.” Ross Klein  who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises  says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them. “The workers are powerless ” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.” Alexandra Nedeltcheva  still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19  has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria  so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There  as of 14 April  two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating  according to a report by a French TV station. Nedeltcheva says she has enjoyed seeing the world in her 11 years working with Celebrity Cruises  but the treatment she says crew have received during the pandemic has opened her eyes. “I really want something to change ” she says. “They can take much better care of their crew. It’s time the cruising industry does better.” , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/17/Sep/2018/25703364-a145-46b0-bcd0-bcd1dd5f571b-seascape-color-logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36cb97d6d939267b509f3c77edb29677440be482/0_270_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c90c1064305d2867a600d58279ca0693 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b05d4419605b955b08d2503b661e2e36ed0a6bff/0_0_4291_2864/master/4291.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67324b9b580a3069179366915f2a341d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a/0_0_3902_2600/master/3902.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d0ce0f64520852bac2815b678f9db7a9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da79a3fa901f293204107e769208dd183f9a10f/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3cac9dbd4bb7d896859f1202254c7490 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ad03d1fe08db80228e6835ce8c50c0542c99f6/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b51c053a8b90dc7828f0653fa47bd28c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6629d41305acc85db45b931c5e6de962178a988/0_0_4431_2951/master/4431.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=178709b63b46f747aa45f3e0ce5fde8a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news%2CCruises%2CTravel%2COceans%2CUS+news%2CBahamas%2CAmericas https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

The agency issued a “purple notice” to warn its 194 member agencies of “this new modus operandi” involving couriers using bikes  motorcycles or cars. With drug buyers and their dealers under lockdown along with the rest of society in many countries  some drivers are using this time to make a quick buck  while in some cases dealers simply posed as couriers. Others were unwitting mules. “In one Malaysian case  a food delivery rider in the Gombak district of Kuala Lumpur contacted police and asked for his food package to be inspected after he became suspicious ” Interpol said. “The rider had been tasked with delivering a single order of Indian flatbread yet the parcel weighed approximately 11kg .” In Spain  seven people posing as delivery drivers were arrested in Alicante and Valencia after drugs were found concealed in the false bottoms of home delivery backpacks. In Ireland  police found 8kg of cocaine and two handguns hidden in pizza boxes. “Country-wide lockdowns have sharply increased demand for home delivered food and delivery drivers are a common sight on otherwise deserted streets ” Interpol said. This provides the perfect cover for home drug deliveries. “As criminals continue to adapt their activities to a world upended by Covid-19  Interpol’s purple notices are essential tools in enabling police around the world to learn from each other’s successes and address shifting crime patterns ” said Stephen Kavanagh  the agency’s executive director of police services. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d4121dc49ec9151301f5973a3c71b603d7c367/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3858b9a58d16a38c42b72b401a771593 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Drugs%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-african-anti-apartheid-activist-denis-goldberg-dies-ages-87-nelson-mandela,world, 'A giant has fallen': anti-apartheid activist Denis Goldberg dies aged 87, Close associate of Nelson Mandela spent 22 years in whites-only prison in South Africa, A statement from Goldberg’s family and the Denis Goldberg Legacy Foundation Trust said: “Denis Goldberg passed away just before midnight on Wednesday. His was a life well lived in the struggle for freedom in South Africa. We will miss him.” Born in 1933 in Cape Town into a leftwing Jewish family who had emigrated from the UK  Goldberg faced antisemitic attacks at school  which contributed to a growing political awareness. “I understood that what was happening in South Africa with its racism was like the racism in Nazi Germany in Europe that we were supposed to be fighting against ” he later said. Goldberg studied civil engineering and joined the banned Communist party in 1957. In 1960 he was jailed for four months after his arrest during protests following the shooting dead of 69 demonstrators by police in the Sharpeville massacre. On his release  he argued for the escalation of the fight against apartheid  and he became an official in the newly formed military wing of the African National Congress. Goldberg was arrested again in 1963 when the police raided a meeting of leading activists at Liliesleaf Farm  in the Rivonia suburb in the north of Johannesburg  and he was charged with organising a campaign of “violent revolution”. The same raid led to Mandela’s conviction and life sentence. Mandela later recounted Goldberg’s humour during the court proceedings  known as the Rivonia trial. “There was a good deal of gallows humour among us. Denis Goldberg  the youngest of the accused  had an irrepressible sense of humour and often had us laughing when we should not have been ” the Nobel prize laureate wrote. Having faced a potential death sentence  Goldberg responded to his life sentence by shouting to his wife and mother in the gallery: “Life! To live!” He was held in virtual isolation in the whites-only Pretoria Central prison for more than two decades  and allowed only very rare and short meetings with his family. Released in 1985  Goldberg travelled to London where he raised support for the struggle against apartheid. He returned to South Africa in 2002. In recent years Goldberg worked to raise funds for the House of Hope  a space to support young people in impoverished communities around the suburb of Hout Bay  in Cape Town. He had lung cancer and diabetes  and died peacefully at his home in Hout Bay. “A giant has fallen. A truly great South African ” said Eusebius McKaiser  a radio host and journalist. Ronnie Kasrils  a veteran anti-apartheid activist and politician  said Goldberg was an “outstanding  remarkable South African and human being”. Sello Hatang  the chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation  said South Africa had lost “another true patriot … [whose] life was dedicated to the struggle against apartheid and the building of democracy”.

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/eurozone-suffers-record-slump-as-coronavirus-lockdown-reverses-growth,business, As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come, Christine Lagarde says there could be a 15% collapse after record first quarter output fall, After news that the 19-nation monetary union area had contracted a record 3.8% in the first three months of 2020  Christine Lagarde said much worse was possible in the April to June period  when the impact of lockdown restrictions would be most severe. “The eurozone economy has contracted at a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peacetime ” said the ECB president  as she announced modest new measures to encourage bank lending and keep financial markets functioning. In its first meeting since before large parts of Europe were shut down in response to the spread of Covid-19  the ECB decided not to cut its main interest rate or to increase the size and scope of its quantitative easing programme. The central bank’s forecasts suggest that the eurozone could contract by between 5% and 12% in 2020 as a whole  but policymakers kept most of its ammunition in reserve. Lagarde urged eurozone politicians to cooperate on an ambitious package of spending measures to support economic recovery. The ECB president spoke hours after the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat reported the sharpest decline in eurozone activity since monetary union was launched more than two decades ago. France and Italy  the second and third biggest economies in the monetary union area  fell into recession as the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat reported a bigger fall in gross domestic product in the quarter ending in March than the financial markets had been expecting. Of the individual eurozone countries publishing data  France said that after a decline of 0.1% in the final three months of 2019  its economy had contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020  the steepest decline since modern records began in the late 1940s. Italy also had its second successive quarter of economic decline  contracting by 4.7% following a 0.3% decline in late 2019. The impact of Covid-19 on an already weak economy was enough to wipe out all the gains in GDP since the global financial crisis of 2008. Spain  one of the countries most seriously affected by Covid-19  reported a quarterly drop of 5.2%  while Belgian and Austrian GDPs fell by 3.9% and 2.5%  respectively. Germany did not release its growth figures but the effects of the pandemic on the eurozone’s biggest economy were underlined by a 373 000 increase in unemployment and a jump to 10.1 million workers on reduced hours in April. The eurozone was barely growing before the Covid-19 shock  registering expansion of 0.1% in the final three months of 2019. A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of falling output  and analysts said it was now certain that the eurozone as a whole would suffer its biggest slump since its creation at the end of the 1990s. The eurozone’s contraction in the first quarter was far more pronounced than that recorded by the US. On Wednesday the US commerce department said the GDP of the world’s biggest economy had fallen by an annualised 4.8% between January and March  equivalent to a quarterly decline of just over 1%. Andrew Kenningham  a European economist at the consultancy Capital Economics  said the size of the hit to eurozone GDP should embolden the ECB to step up its support for growth. “The blizzard of depressing economic data released on Thursday morning confirms that the eurozone economy was in freefall at the end of March  with GDP dropping by a record amount throughout the region ” he said. Bert Colijn  a eurozone economist for ING bank  said: “France and Spain have been among the most strict in terms of lockdowns and hence their economies have suffered more. This would suggest that a country like Germany has experienced a smaller than average contraction.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a743ce986054957103fc6efc76b2ef27f95fb0a5/0_188_5698_3422/master/5698.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96d7ddcd0337bcc5643d5549335e08b9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Eurozone%2CBusiness%2CEurope%2CGlobal+economy%2CGlobal+recession%2CInternational+trade%2CEconomics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CGermany%2CSpain%2CFrance%2CBelgium%2CAustria%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
01/5/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/more-help-needed-for-british-industrial-sector-says-head-of-make-uk,business, More help needed for British industrial sector  says head of Make UK, Manufacturers will face issues ‘for some time’ after coronavirus lockdown ends  ministers told, Make UK – the body that represents manufacturers – said ministers might need to look beyond the provision of subsidised loans if they were to help producers through a slump on course to be even more severe than current official estimates. With its latest survey showing a dramatic fall in orders and sales  Make UK is particularly concerned about the outlook for larger mid-sized firms that are not listed on the stock exchange but form a vital part of the UK’s manufacturing base. Stephen Phipson  Make UK’s chief executive  said: “All the indications at the moment indicate that  even if a gradual easing of lockdowns begins soon  the impact of this shock will continue to hit companies and livelihoods for some time to come. As such  government may need to be flexible with its future support schemes in the same way that industry is going to have to be flexible with its recovery plans.” In its lobbying of ministers  the employers’ organisation has been arguing that there will be a medium-term need for government to support a recapitalisation effort for businesses that will struggle to repay debt incurred during lockdown. “Some of the current schemes don’t work for everyone  with a lot of firms very nervous about taking on big debts in this climate with no certainty about when they can repay it ” Phipson said. “In that context  government should be working with the banks and other partners to consider a wider range of options.” In its projection of the likely path of the economy this year  the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected manufacturing output to fall by 55% in the second quarter. Make UK said that on the basis of its survey of almost 300 companies  the fall in manufacturing was likely to be larger and that conditions were unlikely to return to anything like normal for some time to come. It urged the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  to consider extending the government’s furloughing scheme beyond the end of June. Its survey showed: Phipson said: “While many manufacturers continue to operate and supply our food  vital medical equipment and PPE  there is no disguising that for the sector overall these are deeply worrying times. “The extent of the collapse in demand is such it means that the recent OBR forecast could be an underestimate unless there is a quite remarkable turnaround  which  to be frank  just isn’t going to happen.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e623bd2a26ffce73ac7f81366f4fdd80dce553/0_208_3796_2276/master/3796.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b1b4de3aad4298ab586cf76bcb56af6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Manufacturing+sector%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/us-unemployment-americans-jobless-coronavirus-pandemic,business, Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow, Pace of job losses appears to be slowing but figures increase and many people yet to receive benefits as backlog hits US system, The latest figures from the labor department released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging  the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The figures are also still undercounting the number of people out of work. Some states are still dealing with backlogs of claims after their systems were overwhelmed by the massive volume of applications. Florida has become a notable black spot. As of Tuesday the state had received more than 1.9 million claims and processed just over 664 000  one of the slowest rates in the nation. Kia Washington  22  lost her job at Scarlett’s  a club in Fort Myers  on 16 March. She has yet to receive unemployment benefits or the $1 200 stimulus cheque she is entitled to from the federal bailout. Washington said every time she has tried to file her claim online she has been kicked out of the system  and that she had been trying at 4am or later in the hope of getting through but to no avail. She sent in a paper application three weeks ago but has yet to have a reply. She is currently living with her grandparents. “If I didn’t have them  I would be out on the streets ” she said. The pace of layoffs may slow further as states begin to open up for business once more. But some have warned that relaxing quarantine rules could trigger another wave of infections and shutdowns and the virus has already done significant damage to the economy. Many large US companies have announced cuts to staff or are planning layoffs. Boeing announced this week that the coronavirus had delivered “a body blow” to its business and is weighing laying off 16 000 people  a 10% cut to its 161 000 workforce. Hertz  the car rental company  recently laid off about 10 000 employees in North America and is reportedly considering bankruptcy. On Tuesday the commerce department announced the US economy shrank 4.8% in the first three months of the year  its steepest decline since the last recession and ending a decade of near constant economic growth. Kevin Hassett  senior economic adviser to Donald Trump has warned that the jobless rate in the US could spike to between 16% and 20% by June. According to the latest Department of Labor figures  the insured unemployment rate – the number of people currently receiving unemployment insurance as a percentage of the labor force  was 12.4% for the week ending 18 April   the highest percentage recorded since the department started releasing those figures. Next Friday the bureau of labor statistics releases its official jobs report for themonth of April. The monthly report is regarded as a more accurate snapshot of the jobs market but often lags the weekly report. In March the jobless rate rose 0.9%  the largest single-month change since January 1975  to 4.4%. The pandemic shutdowns started in late March  so April will give a more accurate picture of their impact on the jobs market. JP Morgan is predicting unemployment could reach 20%. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9f5b1473a9ae9e4cd4b1d3b405f56b5392bf10/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=928dd5039fba60b0a5086580c8f37f12 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd51dfe148fec5769442f81f101a03d26df52628/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00ae0c5568ee062458a4721a8c3ca268 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acb060bb9fd5654d192a280c9eec4c7c8a523ff/0_40_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46e7cfd6549f890ac77d642bff37ea60 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1301d7b23ac0ace5e0f4fb75ac535e9cb20ab8/0_32_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c06e13fbba60b4732a34a39321a99c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf35917022d3725c5b66fea9ebaa96b64e7e0f37/131_0_2413_1448/master/2413.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e04f1eb0f66c00ebda77eb8ff2198d8 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=US+economy%2CUS+unemployment+and+employment+data%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CUS+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-scheme,business, UK Treasury rushes to finalise coronavirus bounce back loan scheme, Details of Rishi Sunak’s small business support yet to be agreed  days ahead of launch, The new “bounce back” loan scheme was announced by the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  at the start of the week with some key details still to be ironed out  and is scheduled to become available on Monday. Some banks are concerned that the chancellor’s pledge to distribute cash within 24 hours of receiving a funding request could prove unrealistic  and are still waiting to confirm the questions that will be included in the scheme’s one-page application form. The Treasury is expected to force banks to offer a standardised interest rate or cap on the loans once the initial 12-month interest-free period runs out. That rate could be set as early as Friday once UK banks hand in their own pricing information  though there has been speculation that the number could end up around 2.5%. Neither of the existing government-backed loan schemes have involved capping rates. Some lenders are also worried that they may breach regulations by taking part in the scheme. Preparations are expected to continue throughout the weekend  according to industry sources  who said it could come down to the wire. There has been precedent for last-minute revisions: it is understood that term sheets for the original programme for aiding small businesses  the coronavirus interruption loan scheme (CBILS)  were not completed until 3am on the day of its launch on 23 March. It is understood that even after the new scheme is launched  the rules for the bounce back loan scheme will be kept under review by the Treasury and the City regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority. Figures released by the banking industry trade body on Thursday showed that 25 262 CBILS loans worth £4.1bn have so far been distributed to small and medium-sized businesses. That equates to only 48% of the 52 807 businesses that have applied. By contrast  France said it expected to distribute €40bn (£35bn) worth of loans to local businesses by the end of the month. The bounce back loan scheme offers 100% government-backed loans to small businesses worth up to 25% of their turnover  up to £50 000. The standardised application  which is expected to be an online form  is expected to speed up the process for businesses affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown. Lenders have been accused of dragging their heels on CBILS and being too slow to distribute the loans  which are 80% backed by the government. However  banks have said they have been carrying out the appropriate checks and have been working overtime to get money to customers. Banks are concerned they could be breaching regulatory duties to carry out affordability checks for their smallest business borrowers  who are protected by the Consumer Credit Act. Under those rules  banks have to make sure borrowers fully understand the terms of the loan  otherwise the loan contract could be cancelled. Senior managers are now legally accountable for any errors made on lending practices. In normal circumstances  changes to the act would require a change to UK legislation. Banks are now waiting to see whether the FCA will give concrete guidance on how the rules might be relaxed without requiring MPs to vote through emergency changes. A spokesperson for the banking industry trade association  UK Finance  said: “This scheme is a vital part of the support provided to help business at this time. The industry has worked closely with HMT on the development of the scheme.” The Treasury and FCA were contacted for comment. HSBC said it had approved 5 295 or around 20% of the CBILS loans  worth £765.2m  while Barclays has issued just over 17% of the total  worth £835m. Lloyds has approved 4 361  representing around 15% of the loans  worth £500m. RBS still holds the largest proportion of the loans  around 31%  after approving 8 292 worth £1.6bn. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7da3695a2154134b75c18321299dcfc4be18368c/0_193_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa14d265ea4b769a47bd168ccb539e0f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Small+business%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CRishi+Sunak%2CBanking%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CFinancial+sector%2CRegulators https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/lloyds-bank-profits-crash-95-to-cover-expected-surge-in-bad-debts,business, Lloyds profits crash 95% as bank covers expected surge in bad debts, Bank sets aside £1.4bn for potential defaults by customers struggling amid coronavirus lockdown, The first-quarter provision is meant to cover potential defaults by customers over the coming months  as they struggle to keep up with payments due to the UK’s nationwide lockdown. Lloyds is the UK’s largest provider of home loans  one of its biggest backers of businesses and is often viewed as a bellwether for the British economy. The front-loaded costs nearly wiped out pre-tax profits  which collapsed year-on-year from £1.6bn to just £74m for the three-month period to March. Lloyds was expected to set aside around £1.1bn worth of impairments  according to analysts  who had forecast profits of about £860m. The bank said it was expecting to put aside more money to cover bad loans in the second quarter  but said it was difficult to forecast given the “significant uncertainty.” Lloyds chief executive António Horta-Osório said: “The coronavirus pandemic presents an unprecedented social and economic challenge which is having a significant impact on people and businesses in the UK and around the world. “The economic outlook is clearly challenging with the longer-term outcome dependent on the severity and length of the pandemic and the mitigating impact of Government and other measures in the UK and across the world. “Throughout this period of uncertainty we will continue to work closely with government  regulators and other authorities and use the strength of our balance sheet and business model to ensure that we play our part in supporting our customers and the UK economy.” Lloyds is the latest lender to lay bare the likely costs of the pandemic. On Wednesday  Barclays reported a 38% drop in pre-tax profits to £913m after taking a £2.1bn charge to cover bad debts  which it predicts could soar to £4.5bn by the end of the year. Earlier this week  HSBC warned it could end up setting aside $11bn (£8.8bn) to cover loan losses for 2020  after the pandemic hit its main markets across Asia and Europe. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3340df7c15c60b619446af19166a7fa653775b56/478_263_3482_2092/master/3482.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59508d99249f2508e0300e6ff031bb57 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Lloyds+Banking+Group%2CBanking%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CBorrowing+%26+debt%2CMoney%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/shell-cuts-dividend-for-first-time-since-1945-amid-oil-price-collapse,business, Shell cuts dividend for first time since 1945 amid oil price collapse, First-quarter payout from FTSE 100’s biggest dividend payer to fall by two-thirds amid coronavirus crisis, The energy giant told its shareholders  including thousands of retail investors and pension funds  that it would be in their best interests for payouts to fall for the first time in almost 80 years. The payout is being cut by 66%  from $15bn last year to $5bn this year. Ben van Buerden  Shell’s chief executive  said the “monumental” decision to reset the company’s dividend was difficult but necessary to preserve the financial resilience of the company against a “crisis of uncertainty”. Shell is the biggest dividend payer in the FTSE 100 and the quarterly payout will fall by two-thirds to 16 cents a share. The company described the move as a “prudent” step in weathering the impact of the Covid-19 on the oil markets and the global economy. Shell’s share price fell by 11%. Its market value has fallen by 44% since the beginning of this year  the fastest rate in the company’s history  and it has lost its place as the FTSE 100’s most valuable company to drugs maker Astrazeneca. “We do not consider that maintaining the current level of the dividend is in the best interest of shareholders or the company ” Van Beurden said. “No CEO wants on their track record a cut to the dividend which is iconic in the market. But the situation we are facing is totally unprecedented.” The collapse in global oil prices to 21 year lows following the outbreak of the pandemic earlier this year caused Shell’s profits for the first quarter to tumble to $2.9bn (£2.3bn)  down 46% from $5.3bn in the same quarter last year. The impact in the second quarter will “more severe”  Van Beurden said. Shell plans to scrap all executive bonuses for this financial year  and rein in spending and costs to save up to $9bn. The company will “probably” consider voluntary redundancies. “That is not going to happen anytime soon  if at all this year. But if this goes on  it is inevitable that there will be consequences ” Van Beurden said. Shell’s decision to cut its dividend for the first time in almost 80 years breaks with a decades-long taboo among major oil companies against cutting shareholder returns. Shell will also stall plans to buy back the shares which it paid to shareholders in lieu of dividends during the previous oil market downturn in 2015. Earlier this week  BP’s new chief executive  Bernard Looney  said the company’s board had decided not to cut its dividend for the first quarter despite plunging to a loss. BP has cut its dividend only twice in the last 30 years  most recently in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010  which led to 11 fatalities and a bill topping $65bn. He did not rule out future cuts to manage a slow oil market recovery. The market narrative regarding Shell’s dividend record will need to change  Van Beurden added. It will no longer be “‘no cuts since World War Two’  it is ‘no cuts since the last pandemic’ ” he said. Van Beurden said he does not expect a recovery in global oil markets or the world’s demand for oil over the medium term  meaning the company would need to prepare for the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. The chief executive added that the collapse of global oil markets raises the likelihood that the world will reach ‘peak oil demand’ within the next decade. This may mean that the company shows preference to clean energy projects “which serve us better in the future”  he said.

However  given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty  weaker commodity prices  higher volatility and uncertain demand outlook  the board believes that maintaining the current level of shareholder distributions is not prudent.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2144fe334854022d6928c60c100267a97fc00313/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=214c67a6f8fddac392a1356b592f934a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac98d8317ec0bd1d1e5afca8690f3e26076e587/0_66_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad99cea51619987a583787bda390c265 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6e59ba1903895f68a511720f7fc411c6edb2ad/0_122_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b1adc477c01c2ee120db92b1759a3c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347b40977863c915aea55c0438f644c889497550/0_257_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15a22c573ba4efdca17b5f2ae15ea975 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4311da7e0da21fced07b59659638026c8648e4a6/0_148_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83076b2c69ab86a92d76ff0d6729d75d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Royal+Dutch+Shell%2CBusiness%2COil%2CCommodities%2COil+and+gas+companies%2CEnergy+industry%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
30/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/30/spacewatch-hubble-space-telescope-turns-30,science, Spacewatch: Hubble space telescope turns 30, Telescope has made substantial scientific contributions to almost every branch of astronomy, Since then  Hubble has been extraordinarily successful  making substantial scientific contributions to almost every branch of astronomy. Thanks to its unique design  it has been repaired and upgraded five times by visiting astronauts and this has made it one of Nasa’s longest-lived and most valuable observatories. Only the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 put a stop to future servicing missions. Being above the atmosphere means Hubble has been able to take extremely sharp images and these often spectacular vistas have found their way into the public’s consciousness. One of Hubble’s primary goals was to measure the speed at which the universe is expanding. It did this with such extraordinary precision that it revealed the expansion was accelerating. To power the acceleration  cosmologists now believe that a mysterious energy field  known as dark energy  must be among the universe’s principal components. Nasa in collaboration with the European Space Agency  which is a partner on Hubble  is launching the James Webb space telescope sometime in the next few years. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48ce4c5a985e7c06faadf6f81663b72578dfeb9/0_219_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ae6c98dbd626f772c81994ded3db5d1 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Space%2CAstronomy%2CHubble+space+telescope%2CScience%2CNasa%2CEuropean+Space+Agency https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19,world, Revealed: Cummings is on secret scientific advisory group for Covid-19, Exclusive: Leaked list reveals presence of Johnson adviser and Vote Leave ally on supposedly independent body, It reveals that both Cummings and Ben Warner were among 23 attendees present at a crucial convening of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 23 March  the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a televised address. Multiple attendees of Sage told the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February. The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group  which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret. Warner  a data scientist  was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party’s general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. The government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was “shocked” to discover there were political advisers on Sage. “If you are giving science advice  your advice should be free of any political bias ” he said. “That is just so critically important.” Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting  King replied: “Oh my goodness. Isn’t this maybe why they don’t want us to know who was there?” King said political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of Sage when he chaired them and argued that Cummings  who is not a scientist  could report his own interpretation of Sage advice back to the prime minister. Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington  a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister  said: “I’m not aware of any minister or special adviser  certainly not in Theresa May’s time  ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.” In a statement provided by Downing Street  a government spokesperson said: “Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.” Late on Friday  Downing Street released a second statement. “It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘on’ or members of Sage. Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall ” a No 10 spokesman said. “Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this ” the spokesperson added. “Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.” Downing Street declined to say how many Sage meetings Cummings and Warner attended  or whether any other political advisers took part. Sage participants told the Guardian the Downing Street advisers were not merely observing the advisory meetings  but actively participating in discussions about the formation of advice. In a letter to parliament this month  Sir Patrick Vallance  the UK government’s chief scientific adviser  who chairs Sage  said the “decision not to disclose” membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. “This contributes towards safeguarding individual members’ personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice ” Vallance wrote. “Of course  we do not stop individuals from revealing that they have attended Sage.” On Friday  England’s chief medical officer  Prof Chris Whitty  appeared to signal a change in direction  saying the public had a right to know who sat on Sage. He told a Commons science select committee that while it was important to consider security concerns  there was “absolutely no barrier” from him or Vallance. Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given  Whitty replied: “Yes.” Several members on Sage  as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees  are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government’s response to Covid-19. Since the outbreak  ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice  while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains. Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions  and the UK’s approach has raised eyebrows overseas. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in “a virtual black box”. “Its list of members is secret  its meetings are closed  its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later  if at all.” The Guardian understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January  then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February  and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week. It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings  they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner  they were not allowed to ask questions  having to instead submit them in writing in advance. While core members of the committee  such as Whitty  attend all meetings  other clinical experts  scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting  but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office’s emergency Cobra meetings. Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock  the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England  and Ian Diamond  the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson  the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision–making  was also present  along with fellow infectious disease specialists  Graham Medley and John Edmunds. Others attendees included Brooke Rogers  a professor of behavioural science at King’s College – who also chairs the Cabinet Office’s National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group – and James Rubin  also at King’s  who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science. However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government’s scientific advisory process is free from political interference. A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner  whose brother  Marc  runs Faculty  an artificial intelligence company that the Guardian revealed is involved in an “unprecedented” data-mining operation as part of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. An accomplished data scientist  Ben Warner previously worked at his brother’s AI company  which has teamed up with Palantir  the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel  to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359bcba86dc36d52dc7fb6a825faa8a5a6f6d7be/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5311d615cb033ef59f5dc781fb1f24a8 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDominic+Cummings%2CBrexit%2CHealth+policy%2CBoris+Johnson%2CConservatives%2CInfectious+diseases%2CPolitics%2CScience%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-uk-ministers-were-warned-last-year-of-risks-of-coronavirus-pandemic,world, Revealed: UK ministers were warned last year of risks of coronavirus pandemic, Briefing  which recommended stockpiling PPE among other measures  intensifies focus on No 10’s handling of outbreak, The detailed document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives  and set out the must-have “capability requirements” to mitigate the risks to the country  as well as the potential damage of not doing so. It comes as the UK’s hospital death toll from coronavirus heads towards 20 000. Less than a month ago  the medical director at NHS England  Prof Stephen Powis  said the country would “have done very well” to stay below this grim milestone. Marked “official  sensitive”  the 2019 National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance  the government’s chief scientific adviser  as well as a senior national security adviser to the prime minister whom the Guardian has been asked not to name. The recommendations within it included the need to stockpile PPE (personal protective equipment)  organise advanced purchase agreements for other essential kit  establish procedures for disease surveillance and contact tracing  and draw up plans to manage a surge in excess deaths. Having plans for helping British nationals abroad and repatriating them to the UK was also flagged as a priority. All of these areas have come under relentless scrutiny since the start of the coronavirus pandemic  with the government accused of being too slow to react to the crisis. It is now under sustained pressure to provide answers about what was done nationally and locally to provide the support that planners have long called for  amid growing fears ministers were “caught out” by the crisis and have been playing catchup ever since. The Cabinet Office document  which runs to more than 600 pages  not only analysed the risk of a viral flu pandemic but also specifically addressed the potential for a coronavirus outbreak (the earlier Sars and Mers were both coronaviruses)  though it regarded this as potentially much less damaging. In reality  the UK is dealing with a hybrid of the two  raising further questions about whether ministers were quick enough to recognise the dangers and were able to rely on whatever preparations were already in place. Drawing on previous security assessments and health risk registers  the document implicitly warned ministers they could not afford to be complacent. “A novel pandemic virus could be both highly transmissible and highly virulent ” it said. “Therefore  pandemics significantly more serious than the reasonable worst case … are possible.” The government declined to provide specific details of the preparations that had been made prior to the pandemic  but said it would be unfair to say they were “starting from scratch”  pointing to planning exercises carried out in recent years. “This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it  guided at all times by the best scientific advice ” a government spokesman said. “The government has been proactive in implementing lessons learned around pandemic preparedness. This includes being ready with legislative proposals that could rapidly be tailored to what became the Coronavirus Act  plans to strengthen excess death planning  planning for recruitment and deployment of retired staff and volunteers  and guidance for stakeholders and sectors across government.” But one source with knowledge of the Cabinet Office document said the UK had not properly focused on the pandemic threat  and had been caught flat-footed. “The really frustrating thing is that there were plans. But over the last few years emergency planning has been focused on political drivers  like Brexit and flooding. “There was a national plan for dealing with a pandemic that should have been implemented. But who took control of that? And who was responsible for making sure that plans were being made at a local level? The truth is  I am not sure anyone was doing this.” The source added: “We have been paying for a third-party fire and theft insurance for a pandemic  not a comprehensive one. We have been caught out.” The shadow Cabinet Office minister  Rachel Reeves  said the revelations were “alarming … and raised serious questions about the government’s planning and preparedness for a coronavirus-style pandemic”. She demanded her opposite number  Michael Gove  give a statement to parliament on Monday to explain “whether this report was read and what actions were taken”. The NSRA sets out a series of potential reasonable worst case scenarios (RWCS) for the spread of a flu-like viral pandemic  which emergency planning experts regard as the benchmark for its preparedness in the current crisis. It also included predictions that offer insights into how planners believe a crisis like this current emergency might evolve. The document said: • A pandemic would play out in up to “three waves”  with each wave expected to last 15 weeks … “with the peak weeks occurring at weeks 6 and 7 in each wave”. • 50% of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves. The actual number of people infected would be higher than this  as there would be a number of asymptomatic cases. • A pandemic of moderate virulence could lead to 65 600 deaths. • The potential cost to the UK could be £2.35tn. • Even after the end of the pandemic  it is likely that it would take months or even years for health and social care services to recover. • There would be significant public outrage over any perceived poor handling of the government’s preparations and response to the emergency. Whitehall sources concede that turning “plans on the page to real life” was always proving a challenge  but said that in some respects the Brexit planning had helped. The government spokesman said its response to the emergency had protected lives and businesses: “Our response has ensured that the NHS has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it  as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers.” But political pressure is mounting on the government. On Wednesday  the Labour leader  Sir Keir Starmer  demanded ministers explain why “we were slow into lockdown  slow on testing  slow on protective equipment”. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday  Dame Deirdre Hine  who produced a report for government on the swine-flu pandemic  said she feared the government had not implemented the plans for a pandemic. “I think they have been complacent ” she said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83155b865a3812003d3b3f2c78b0ca7fad4cd696/0_0_1983_1585/master/1983.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b1661ff6a1cc1a56e82aa020a7a9f04 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6868f2f6f28569255a5aa78f108867a885d13a89/0_314_1983_1189/master/1983.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a531bb1efa2805486ee022a0b96656b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CHealth+policy%2CInfectious+diseases%2CHealth https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-detected-particles-air-pollution,environment, Coronavirus detected on particles of air pollution, Exclusive: Scientists examine whether this route enables infections at longer distances, The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease. The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory. Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy  who led the work  said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution. “I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know ” he said. “If we know  we can find a solution. But if we don’t know  we can only suffer the consequences.” Two other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air. A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed  an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe. Neither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation. Previous studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu  measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances. The potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets  less than 5 microns in diameter  can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further. Experts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections  though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets. But researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission  and the possible boosting role of pollution particles  mean it must not be ruled out without evidence. Prof Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air  the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.” He said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China. Setti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer. “The pollution particle is like a micro-airplane and the passengers are the droplets ” said Sett. Reid is more cautious: “I think the very small change in the size of the [combined] particles is unlikely to play much of a role.” Prof Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible  but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.” Another expert  Prof John Sodeau at University College Cork  in the Republic of Ireland  said: “The work seems plausible. But that is the bottom line at the moment  and plausible [particle] interactions are not always biologically viable and may have no effect in the atmosphere.” He said the normal course of scientific research might take two or three years to confirm such findings. Other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health  which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19. • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK? , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526881daf2daa8f50bd3e9345fb1ad7d4d568ec/0_191_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f011979b9d1cd4b1ee582d0a96ad4ec https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Air+pollution%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEnvironment%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CScience%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/24/home-not-away-the-tulip-project-in-pictures,artanddesign, Home  not away: the Tulip Project – in pictures, What does the Guardian’s decorated sports photographer do in lockdown? Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his garden, At this time of year  I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National  or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot  not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year. It was mid-March  and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival  an event I associate with the end of winter  spring coming  the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport  going to events that I love. But this year  the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing  and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down. I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off  I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson  a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed  he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you  focus on things you can affect  and try to forget what’s out of your control. Remembering this  I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil  ready to bloom. In these plants  I saw hope. I saw normality. It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness  nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me  photography is more than just a career: it is my passion  and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home. To test myself  I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport  all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead  I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”  an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work  many of which are heavy). Light  easy to manoeuvre around the plants  and – most crucially – able to focus close-up  this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project. As the sun moved round the garden during the day  backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants  and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light. Like all photographers  I look to light as another tool in the box  an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles  I could make petals look like paper  tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight  I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy  so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality. I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden  this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine  my house has never felt more like a castle  defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle  my garden is the green inner sanctum  a place of peace and tranquillity. As I sit here now  in the sunshine  I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves  with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun  bright and sharp at this time of year  makes everything look crisp. In times like these  we remember that nature truly is life-affirming  and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world  normality is king. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/923ce0c3b18595fd8b55a5c473466718bc5e59f2/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3d28d9c0e9073a0f857fcdc4a8d83b0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f670c54c74ee8fcd2de1b83b4cfc7593a003671d/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c6e159212dca07418672368c1b40d11 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6d7db7b355bf1ce59c465d4c53e6d4e9a1164c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ac8239df252c12fa081d5ba864848b9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/615c28b7e62186046b52e09b21a7b98c3fb8cb3e/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a07cf0e53202ecd610acd078cec8e58 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5c075b1b3f7520b6b09a7de917440e4d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3070f55a98bf56f8865f87855812d43bf31afb88/0_0_3528_5292/master/3528.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0425f294a40fc2b2e3863741c0938126 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/537bf8b4084de7768142803239150595cf4cf747/0_0_4000_6000/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c209a80e94cedf1489703fb52aeb0fb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3385546d80184804c401ea9c07b9980f5d777be5/0_0_3860_5790/master/3860.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a28abbb2a4182c73176d0c1edb38efc5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63f7479cb871c7682645d2a62df0e6eca7fab09/0_0_4000_6000/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ae16997ff97908b247ec22ee6709b87 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79c7f200df03d74d163d70c0211df4c7592f1ab/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20337acd08047a22029afa2d1eabd912 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c813c3e05167be5805e9046f340badda19c49529/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de4fa124751767bdf69ef50beb5e6fce https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1079be631eb6b2906b9006056bee4f811da7ae/16_16_3805_5965/master/3805.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cdfeecbcb4c8ee93960f04fac64bce01 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7ea96ef78d21f5fc2ad7b6b6b18457e2bf6a06/185_3_3737_5857/master/3737.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b91f5aa512a6d7a3947442f4c6eacade https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11a528fe59c2328db8cc42ecf0a280eb7c4f1ce1/0_0_3869_5804/master/3869.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=450582b246143e64908bb3f31eddb6c4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d37c1df80fd4630a3f2662a3f06a077e5a955b/40_5_2686_4025/master/2686.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05ff1ec5c10f3bf30250a97cc521e147 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40bcb6ecdc1fc7fab2e8cf11e4c993f9efdc4c2d/0_0_4720_3146/master/4720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=34203d677f02f20d557699f4ad03cfeb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/920e9c6c8f326d1497ebe731ce7ba81a82df840f/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bd830eacd0b04c863a6aa304a15eef0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6b0e3afef650f46b92b65a4bf8733a0906eb6b5/0_0_4782_3188/master/4782.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf082a114600548beb66d578faee63f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Photography%2CUK+news%2CArt+and+design%2CGardens%2CLife+and+style%2CCulture https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/24/uk-government-told-not-to-use-zoom-because-of-china-fears,uk-news, UK government told not to use Zoom because of China fears, Security services said last week that videoconferencing tool was vulnerable to surveillance, The quiet warnings to limit the technology came after the cabinet had used Zoom to hold a well-publicised meeting at the end of March  a decision that was defended at the time as necessary in “unprecedented circumstances”. Parliament was advised last week by the National Cyber Security Centre  part of intelligence agency GCHQ  that Zoom should only be used for public business. A parliamentary source said those involved were advised Zoom ought not be used for classified business and there was an explicit warning from NCSC “not use it to talk about things detrimental to the interests of China”. But the warning was only shown to people directly engaged in the negotiations  and not shared more widely with MPs  including members of the foreign or other select committees who may want to conduct inquiries into China-related matters. Senior parliamentary figures were also told that Zoom was safe to use for public business  and the technology was this week used as part of the proceedings in the House of Commons  including at prime minister’s questions. Zoom has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus lockdown as a tool for communication for both social and business purposes  and is now used globally by an estimated 300 million people a day. The company’s success has prompted rapid responses from competitors such as Facebook  who announced on Friday a new feature letting up to 50 people join a Messenger video chat. The Citizen Lab  a digital communications laboratory based at the University of Toronto  warned in early April about potential security risks. Security keys  which are supposed to encrypt conversations “in some cases  are delivered to participants in a Zoom meeting through servers in China” it said in a special report published earlier this month. Zoom said this traffic was mistakenly routed through China. However  the government of Taiwan – a country not recognised by China – announced early this month that it would ban the use of products “such as Zoom” where there were security concerns. The Citizen Lab said the popularity of the technology made it of “high priority interest to multiple governments” and would make “Zoom a high priority target for signals intelligence gathering and targeted intrusion operations”. Zoom is based in California’s Silicon Valley  but it owns three companies in China that develop its software. The Citizen Lab said the structure allowed the company to lower its development costs  but added “this arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities.” In response  Zoom has sought to beef up its security  releasing the new version 5 of its app with greater encryption and privacy controls and introducing controls to prevent “Zoombombing” where people have hacked into meetings – such as Alcoholics Anonymous sessions – to disrupt them. A Whitehall source said that an alert about Zoom was circulated to government departments  who were asked to pass it on to quangos  because of the concerns about whether China might be able to listen in. But they complained that the warning was not always being taken sufficiently seriously in parts of Whitehall  although Zoom is currently permitted for meetings where no confidential matters are being discussed. A government spokesperson said that “Zoom is being used for unclassified communications in government under unprecedented circumstance” but added: “Other services are in place for more sensitive communications.” The availability of these more secure services was being increased to meet the demand of more civil servants having to work remotely  the spokesperson added. Zoom said its technology is being used by banks  universities and other government agencies around the world. It added the “routing issues described in Citizen Lab’s research were a temporary issue caused when Zoom failed to fully implement its usual geo-fencing best practices”. These were fixed  it said  and customers who pay to use Zoom can customise where the traffic is processed. The software company said the software developers in China who work as subcontractors to the company were “largely managed by our engineering team in the United States” and said they did not have access to Zoom’s development environment in the US. But a second Citizen Lab report on April 8 – five days after the first – said that while Zoom had taken actions to improve its security “we discourage the use of Zoom in cases where strong confidentiality and privacy is required” including for “governments worried about espionage”. In response to Zoom’s success  Facebook announced on Friday the launch of Messenger Rooms  a new feature for the company’s Messenger app that allows up to 50 people to join a group chat – even if they don’t have a Facebook account  an unusual move for the company that mirror’s Zoom’s own attempts to prioritise ease of use. The social network also doubled the number of people who could join an encrypted WhatsApp video call  from four to eight  and announced a raft of updates to Facebook Live  which lets users broadcast to many viewers at once. According to Stan Chudnovsky  vice-president of Messenger  video calling on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled in areas most affected by Covid-19  and views of Facebook Live and Instagram Live videos increased significantly in March. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee1c2bc0787f87636cf193387dab43124022f02/87_250_5965_3582/master/5965.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c2a3c8277cb45b42bb3c10c7b08ce99 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+security+and+counter-terrorism%2CZoom%2CTechnology%2CPolitics%2CChina%2CUK+news%2CFacebook https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/conservatives-call-for-johnson-return-amid-lockdown-fatigue-signs,world, Conservatives call for Johnson's return amid signs of lockdown fatigue, Police chief questions car guidance as data shows more people venturing out, Warnings for the public to continue respecting lockdown rules were sounded at Friday’s Downing Street briefing  where data showed that there had been an increase of between 2% and 3% in transport use over the past week. While driving and journeys on public transport have remained consistently low  data from Apple reflecting requests for directions also suggested that there had been an uptick over the past week in terms of people venturing out on foot in London. On Wednesday  the government’s own figures had shown that the UK’s vehicle traffic levels this week were at their highest since the country’s lockdown began. The transport secretary  Grant Shapps  added that the country had “done incredibly well” but warned: “There is a danger as we go into another warm sunny weekend that people think that the peak is over – but it is not over. We are riding perhaps  we hope  a downward trend but it is by no means established yet.” The deputy chief medical officer for England  Jenny Harries  said: “On the whole  as we have just seen  most of the public are really complying and really do support [social distancing]. That becomes increasingly difficult as we go through.” The data on transport use came as a senior police chief criticised national police guidance on exercise rules as hundreds of people in south-west England flouted lockdown restrictions to enjoy 20C sunshine. While updated guidance from the National Police Chiefs’ Council stated that driving to the countryside and walking was considered a “reasonable excuse” for people to leave their homes in England  it was criticised by the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police  Shaun Sawyer  who said people should not drive to go exercising  dog walking or surfing. “The National Police Chiefs’ guidance  which I think is some of the poorest guidance I have seen for a long time sadly  would allow people from outside the force [region] access to come in  the very thing that our communities don’t want ” he added. His comments came as calls for the prime minister to return to the helm of government grew louder on Conservative backbenches. Andrew Bridgen  the MP for North West Leicestershire  said: “There are huge decisions that are going to have to be made in the near future and that can only be done by the prime minister. Boris can carry the public with him  he is the leader of the party with a huge election victory.” Bridgen said detail on easing lockdown restrictions for businesses and more information on when schools might go back would be top of Johnson’s in-tray. Another Tory backbencher said Johnson’s absence had put significant strain on the government and lead to people taking the daily press conferences who did not have his skills. “There is a sense that people do want him back mainly because the people who have stepped in have maybe not performed as well as he could have done ” they said. “I’m thinking of the press conference [of the business secretary] Alok Sharma took  and Priti Patel’s [home secretary]. There is a sense it’s much better to have one person that everybody knows as the focal point and that the people brought in on a daily basis have not been as good. “What this has revealed is that the bench has not stepped up.” Ministers had been discussing a sector-by-sector approach to lifting the lockdown in recent weeks. However  Whitehall sources say the expectation is now that the focus will be on the nature of the work being carried out: can it be done while maintaining physical distance  and how essential is it to the economy? The “quad” of senior ministers – Matt Hancock  Dominic Raab  Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak – has also begun work on the preconditions that would have to be in place before workplaces could reopen  including increasing the frequency of transport services  and reopening schools. Government sources sought to play down divisions over what happens next. “Most of the cabinet are in a pretty similar place: everybody wants the lockdown to end as soon as possible  but we have to do it at the right time ” said one adviser. Greater Manchester police thanked the public following what the force said had been a significant reduction in calls to house parties. Officers were called to 432 reports of house parties last weekend  a 52% reduction on previous reports. But there were hints of a potential unravelling of the lockdown in London  as the city headed into a warm weekend. On social media  Londoners reported seeing more traffic on the roads and more people using parks for more than just brief exercise. The latest “Covid?19 mobility trends” data from Apple  which reflect daily requests for directions in Apple Maps  suggested that walking by Londoners was starting to tick up for the last three weekends compared with the first day of the lockdown. Weekdays in the last two weeks had also seen slightly more movement. Driving and public transport usage was consistently lower. More reassuringly  recent data from Transport for London showed levels of movement on public transport in the capital this week were broadly as they were last week. On the underground and buses  ridership was still down 95% and 85% respectively compared to the same time last year. A spokesperson for London’s mayor  Sadiq Khan  said: “Sadiq has been absolutely clear that unless Londoners are making an essential journey  they should stay at home to save lives. The vast majority of Londoners have followed this advice.” Speculation over Johnson’s imminent return to work grew after Donald Trump said he had sounded “incredible” and “ready to go” in a phone call with him following his discharge from hospital. A report in the Daily Telegraph suggested Johnson  who has been recuperating at Chequers  could return to work on Monday. While Downing Street said the PM was yet to work on his “red box” of official papers as usual  his official spokesman said he was regularly receiving updates on the coronavirus response and had had calls with Raab  the foreign secretary  and Hancock  the health secretary. However another Tory told the Guardian the prime minister should not rush back to work as other ministers were coping. They said: “For Boris there’s no rush and the priority is that he has got to be fully ready. Matt Hancock has been a hero throughout this and worked tirelessly.” Additional reporting by Alex Hern and Caelainn Barr , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a83c356543e47f4c01ec3faa4adfc8ae3da2dc45/486_466_4837_2902/master/4837.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f954e5a129cb16558d55bdddeb934f25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/664aefe6e9bda6873e616d11912c43d8c733158d/0_191_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9f2d8a62e21fdaf4be6cd33121c3b03 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f5a16ac4af0b043f3d078b3bc2a2d29f277bec/0_129_4271_2562/master/4271.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea77f2c2458863ad83b81afd16cc62f2 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CBoris+Johnson%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/leaked-cabinet-office-briefing-on-uk-pandemic-threat-the-key-points,world, Leaked Cabinet Office briefing on UK pandemic threat – the key points, From management of excess deaths to public outrage  2019 document set out likely social and economic risks, It was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance  the government’s chief scientific adviser. Over 600 pages  it runs through dozens of potential threats – but an “influenza-type pandemic” is at the top of this worry list  as it has been for years. Here are some selected extracts… Up to 50% of the UK population may fall ill  with up to 20% of people off work during the peak weeks  causing a significant impact on business continuity. Critical national infrastructure may also be affected during peak periods. There would be a huge surge in demand for health and social care services. Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS  the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths. This would be felt on a national scale  with local capacity likely to start to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic. While not explicitly stated in every case  an influenza- type pandemic would probably compound the effects of the vast majority of risks in the NSRA  as all sectors would experience staffing pressures. Procedures related to disease surveillance and early detection  plus any associated infrastructure  should be in place. Robust and tested arrangements for rapid scientific and clinical advice should similarly be set up. Local and national plans for management of excess deaths resulting from any mass casualty event should be present. Local and national plans to deal with a surge in demand for health and social care services need to be accounted for. There needs to be stockpiles of countermeasures and advanced purchase arrangements for those that cannot be acquired in advance. Communication plans to encourage social distancing and good hygiene should be active. Sector resilience plans  including planning for absence of key workers  need enforcing. It is predicted that an influenza pandemic would come in multiple waves. This means that recovery from one wave could be hampered by the arrival of a subsequent wave. Even after the end of a pandemic  it is likely that it would take months  or even years  for health and social care services to recover  although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. It is likely the economic impact would be felt for years. The reasonable worst case scenario (RWCS) assumes that the pandemic will come in multiple waves (up to three)  each approximately 15 weeks long. For example  in the RWCS  9 840 000 people would require assessment by health services (30% of those who are symptomatic)  of which 1 312 000 people would require hospital treatment and 328 000 the highest level of critical care. Using the estimated UK population for 2016  this RWCS could result in 820 000 fatalities. Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS  the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths  including coroners and burial services. This would be felt on a national scale  with local capacity likely to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic. • The pandemic would present in one or more waves. Each wave is expected to lasting 15 weeks  with the peak weeks occurring at weeks six and seven in each wave. • Ffity per cent of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves. The actual number of people infected would be higher than this  as there would be a number of asymptomatic cases. • A case fatality ratio of 2.5%  meaning 2.5% of those with symptoms could die as a result of the influenza virus. Four per cent of symptomatic patients would require hospital care  25% of whom are expected to need the highest level of critical care (level three). • Peak illness rates of about 10-12% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) are expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven). • Workplace absence rates for illness will be reaching 17-20% in the peak weeks. There are no known markers that herald the start of a new pandemic. Based on most current vaccine technologies  it is likely to take at least four to six months after a novel virus has been identified and isolated for an effective pandemic influenza vaccine to become available from manufacturers in large quantity. This means that the first pandemic wave will not be vaccine-preventable; it will not be possible to contain a novel pandemic virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK. The expectation must be that the virus will spread rapidly to the UK (a major global transport hub) and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at national level and cannot be relied on as a way to “buy time”. The UK has an advanced purchase agreement for pandemic vaccine  which can be triggered in response to a pandemic threat. Even after the end of the pandemic it is likely that it would take months  or even years  for the health and social care services to recover  although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. This variation models a moderate pandemic  based on the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. The annual likelihood of a pandemic with the characteristics described below is 2%. The specific assumptions of this scenario are listed below. There would also be higher than usual absence from work. Public health measures such as school closures and social distancing may be partially successful in delaying the peak of a pandemic wave by a few weeks at most  and might reduce the overall size of a pandemic wave. However these measures are disruptive  with known secondary consequences (eg closing schools would reduce the availability of healthcare workers)  and the limited evidence available suggests that such measures have maximum effect when implemented early and simultaneously. For the RWCS  it is assumed that schools have not been closed. Global travel  particularly commercial airlines  will have an impact on the spread of the disease. Although the strain was mild  the pandemic in 2009 showed that a rapid global spread was possible. However  evidence suggests that border control measures would be largely ineffective  because the duration of most international passenger flights is considerably shorter than the incubation period of the illness. The public outrage would likely be determined by the preparations and response undertaken by the government. Poor government handling of the situation would exacerbate the level of outrage significantly. There would be significant and widespread public outrage directed at the authorities given the very high numbers of fatalities and casualties within vulnerable groups. There would also be significant anger if vaccines  antivirals or other countermeasures were not perceived to be effective  evenly distributed or available as soon as practically possible  including when compared with other countries. The performance of the health and care system is likely to contribute to the public outrage  especially if provision of the remaining services is seen as unevenly distributed. There is also a risk public outrage may be directed at both foreign nations and nationals (who are seen as the “source” of the problem) for not preventing its spread or importing disease into the UK. Total cost: £2 354 738 558 884 Economic impacts – confidence assessment. To put that figure in context  £2.35tn is the equivalent of 131% of GDP. It is worth noting that a large proportion (£1.5tn) of the economic impact comes from the social value of deaths. The capability requirements include disease surveillance systems  staff trained in enhanced infection control practices  adequate access to personalised protective equipment  adequate access to public health staff for contact tracing and follow-up  and excess death management capabilities (including potential infectious material). Decontamination services need to be available. Appropriate specialist healthcare services eg  high level-isolation units must be accessible  as well as appropriate facilities for quarantine. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5134e0120881d7c91c2a7e35aad2a943fa84b4b3/0_113_1900_1140/master/1900.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d493f04dc38d6477e3df64d3d33c0c22 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CVaccines+and+immunisation%2CHealth%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CEconomics%2CPublic+services+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/preparing-for-pandemic-national-security-risk-assessment-coronavirus,world, What does the leaked report tell us about the UK's pandemic preparations?, Leaked National Security Risk Assessment describes threats posed by flu- and non-flu-type infectious diseases, The first  an influenza-type disease pandemic  predicts waves of a novel flu virus striking several months apart. This type of threat represents the basis of the UK government’s blueprint for how it would respond to a pandemic. Britain’s preparations for a flu pandemic include stockpiles of millions of doses of antivirals  including the drugs Tamiflu and Relenza  as well as a digital distribution system called the National Flu Pandemic Service that would be deployed to coordinate the distribution of antivirals to people who were symptomatic. Plans published in 2011 detail stocks of pre-specific vaccine that could be administered to healthcare workers in parallel alongside antivirals  so as to maintain the UK’s health workforce. However  these preparations are contingent on the pandemic being a variation of influenza. Covid-19 is a coronavirus  not a strain of influenza  making some of those preparations less useful. The document also contains a separate chapter anticipating non-flu-based “emerging infectious diseases”  even specifically citing the risk of a novel coronavirus arriving in the UK. The risk model assumes that such a disease would be comparable to Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome)  outbreaks of which afflicted south-east Asia and the Middle East in recent years. Those viruses have case fatality rates of between 33% and 50%  making them far more lethal than Covid-19. In some respects  the UK’s response necessarily has to begin from scratch because of the novel nature of the disease: treatments  vaccines and even the mode of transmission all have to be identified. But the building blocks of responding to a pandemic are roughly the same  a source said: “We are not moving from a standing start. We should be building out from what we know – PPE [personal protective equipment]  community disruption  supply line difficulties and public anxiety. “Pandemic flu gives us the modelling to start from. It’s about building on what you have. What we had at the beginning had been depleted over the years and no one challenged the changes because [the feeling was] something like this would never happen.” Containing any novel disease outbreak in the UK would require intensive measures to detect and limit its spread  the document states. “Sustained human-to-human transmission in emerging airborne diseases is possible ” it reads  “which is why infection control procedures are critical to the mitigation of this risk.” The impacts of an emerging infectious disease anticipated by the risk assessment are vastly less severe than the havoc Covid-19 has wrought. A reasonable worst case scenario included 200 fatalities and an economic cost of £7.5bn  chiefly as a result of a drop in tourism. This is  again  largely because the prediction is modelled upon Sars and Mers  which never achieved the same level of community transmission as Covid-19 has. The coronavirus pandemic’s damage has instead been much more comparable to what the document anticipates for a flu pandemic: potentially hundreds of thousands of fatalities  as well as a total economic cost of over £2tn as a result of widespread and lasting disruption. Alarmingly  the document notes that  although unpredictable  “the emergence of new infectious diseases … appears to have become more frequent”  possibly as a result of worsening global heating. “Climate change may result in conditions that may make the UK more hospitable for establishment of insect vectors of diseases currently not endemic in the country ” it warns. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89fcb88dcded55a9ab63d4555409895d8eb4bc6f/0_161_3060_1837/master/3060.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5875aeedda9b4ebff081e0e0043d0b9c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news%2CSars%2CFlu+pandemic https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/new-mother-dies-of-coronavirus-six-days-after-giving-birth,world, New mother dies of coronavirus six days after giving birth, Fozia Hanif developed symptoms before her 29th birthday  resulting in premature birth of her son  Ayaan, Fozia Hanif  started to develop symptoms and tested positive for the disease just before her 29th birthday  resulting in the premature birth of her son  Ayaan  earlier this month. Just six days after giving birth Hanif’s family were given the devastating news that she would not recover and her ventilator would be turned off. The probation service worker  was only ever able to see her newborn son on a photograph printed for her by nurses at Birmingham Heartlands hospital  with her family describing it as a “happy” moment. “She was really happy  she got the baby photo they (nurses) printed out for her ” her husband of nearly seven years  Wajid Ali  told ITV News. “She was holding and say ‘look it’s our baby’ and ‘we’re going to come home soon’ … that’s the last time I spoke to her.” Her sister  Sophie Hanif said she would receive texts telling her how excited she was to finally meet her baby. “She was messaging us saying ‘oh I haven’t seen the baby yet’ and I said ‘don’t worry about it  when you come home you’re going to come home together and we’re all going to see him together’ ” she said. Initially Hanif who gave birth to her son on 2 April  showed some signs of overcoming the disease and was taken to a recovery ward  but shortly afterwards her condition worsened and she was moved to an intensive care unit (ICU). Hanif  had been going to hospital for check-ups during her pregnancy  when she developed a slight fever in March and hospital staff decided to keep her in for tests. She tested positive for coronavirus but was soon released back home and was able to celebrate her birthday with her family. However  while at home her condition quickly began to deteriorate  and she was taken back to hospital  isolated from her family and put on a ventilator. Her husband said: “They said we’re going to keep her here to find out and we’re going to do a Covid test and they kept her for two days. “The test came back positive and the next day they said it was mild and you can go home. After four days she had difficulty breathing and we called the ambulance.” After being informed she had developed a blood clot and was in a coma  her husband and father  Nabil  were allowed to visit wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). At one stage the family were told her condition was improving and she would be taken to the recovery ward. Her father said: “It gave us proper hope  we got excited. They took her to the recovery ward  they gave her the phone  we actually spoke to her. “When we walked into the hospital when they said they were going to turn the machines off  I said no don’t turn it off until we arrive  she’s a fighter  she can pull through – but when we walked in there  we just kept praying.” Hanif died on 8 April  six days after her son Ayaan was born just 31 weeks into her pregnancy by C-section. While Ayaan has tested negative  he remains in hospital. Her sister added: “She had no time at all. “She was asking for food  she was asking about the baby  she was asking about family and then all of a sudden... It was just a shock to us all.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fffdce5845f062c66660fec4242f40870c7b847/0_10_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8734d233e4fa8050932f4b398001304 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CPregnancy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/childcare-industry-crushed-by-coronavirus-crisis,education, UK childcare industry 'crushed' by coronavirus crisis, More than 10 000 providers likely to be out of business by end of lockdown, A survey by the Childcare online platform found nearly one in six of more than 2 000 providers said they were likely to have permanently closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic  while one in three said they were unsure if they would be able to reopen. Just 50% of the childminders  daycare centres and nurseries surveyed said they were likely to remain open after the lockdown ends. In England alone the results would mean a loss of about 150 000 childcare places currently available for children under school age. The Childcare survey found that out of those likely to close permanently  nearly three-quarters blamed financial difficulties. But the remainder said they expected fewer parents to be able to afford or need the childcare they had previously employed. Richard Conway  Childcare’s founder  said it was “shocking” to discover how many providers were likely to close. Conway said a previous poll had found that many parents were considering keeping their children at home after the lockdown ended  meaning providers were likely to suffer. “But  as other parents plan to head straight back to the office  hopefully the business of childcare will pick up ” he said. According to Department for Education (DfE) figures  there were more than 23 000 private daycare centres or nurseries and nearly 40 000 registered childminders operating in England before the advent of coronavirus this year. About half of childcare providers appear to have remained open since the lockdown began in March  with access restricted to the children of key workers. Many report a shortage of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies  similar to schools and care homes. The likely closures follow the government’s reversal of a policy that would have seen nurseries receive their government-funded childcare entitlement  even if they shut during the lockdown  allowing them to continue paying rent  wages and bills. The education secretary  Gavin Williamson  said at the time the lockdown began in March: “We will continue to pay for all free early years entitlements places  even in the event that settings are closed on the advice of Public Health England  or children are not able to attend due to coronavirus  and we will not be asking for funding back from local authorities.” But on Wednesday the government announced that local authorities would be able to redirect funding away to those settings that remained open. Tulip Siddiq  Labour’s shadow minister for children and early years  said: “Childcare is the fourth emergency service in this crisis  and I know that the government does not want the early years sector which provides it to collapse. So I am urging ministers to rethink this decision and come forward with a proper funding plan to ensure that childcare providers can stay open and survive this crisis.” The Early Years Alliance said providers had told it that local authorities were reducing the level of funding given to settings that had temporarily closed  in order to offer additional funding support to those which are open to key worker families and vulnerable children. Neil Leitch  the chief executive of Early Years Alliance  said it was unacceptable for the government to “continually move the goalposts” for the sector and deprive childcare providers of support they had budgeted for. “While we of course recognise the desire of government and local authorities to do all they can to support providers to stay open for key worker families and vulnerable children  this should not be at the expense of providers who have closed  given that many have had no choice but to take the difficult decision to do so ” Leitch said. A DfE spokesperson said: “Our first priority is ensuring that critical workers and vulnerable children are able to access the childcare places they need at this time. Local authorities will continue to receive free early education entitlement funding throughout the Covid-19 outbreak  and a wide range of support is available for early years providers.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1b330d3664704d167f39455e9552753f993c34/0_70_4719_2831/master/4719.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb2020ecafc3e51f355cf8ebdd85a445 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Early+years+education%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CChildcare%2CChildren%2CEducation%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus,world, Twin sisters  one a nurse in Southampton  two of the latest to die from coronavirus, Katy and Emma Davis among recent victims  who include a BNP member who found Islam, Children’s nurse Katy Davis  37  died at Southampton general hospital on Tuesday. On Friday her identical twin sister  Emma  died at the same hospital. Their sister  Zoe  told the BBC: “They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.” Zoe Davis said the “amazing” pair  who lived together  had underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time. Katy is the latest of more than 100 British health workers who have died from coronavirus. Paula Head  chief executive at University Hospital Southampton  said: “Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like  and that nursing was more than just a job to her. On behalf of everyone here at UHS  including our patients and the communities we serve  I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family.” Among some of the other recent victims is a former British National party member who found Islam and spent the last decade of his life as a respected social worker. Muhammad Islam  who grew up in the 1960s in Gateshead as John Ord  died on Thursday after contracting Covid-19. In 2005 he recounted to the Guardian how he had joined the BNP as a 16-year-old. He became a Muslim after stumbling on a copy of the Qur’an in 1989. He changed his name and settled in Birmingham  married a primary school teacher from a Pakistani background  and started a degree in social work. Since 2010 he had worked for Birmingham Children’s Trust  helping young people leaving care. Its chief executive  Andy Couldrick  said he died after suffering with Covid-19 for a few weeks. He said: “Muhammad was a well respected  well liked and highly valued member of our care leavers team who supported many young people in Birmingham.” Ruth Allen  chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers  said: “Social workers continue to work tirelessly  knocking on doors  delivering vital services out in communities.” The death of an 88-year-old woman in south Wales highlights the lack of protection against the virus in hospices  according to her family. John Hunt suspects that his mother  Elsie Hunt  contracted the virus in a hospice before she died earlier this month in Singleton hospital  Swansea. He said: “Already gravely ill  Covid-19 robbed her of being consoled by her family in her last days. In the hospice  no one wore masks. Even when Mum developed a classic dry cough and fever – and was moved to a single room – staff only wore simple paper masks  and no eye protection.” He said he could see his mother in her final days via FaceTime. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e9625e7615cf32c89bb7f1d4c26cb19549357b/21_0_618_371/master/618.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf8b445e96692cd6b079ef0261d749ed https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CSouthampton%2CUK+news%2CIslam https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/british-soldiers-to-get-insect-repellant-as-covid-19-protection,world, British soldiers to get insect repellant as Covid-19 protection, MoD placing order despite WHO guidance that product would not work, The Ministry of Defence confirmed on Friday that it plans to buy stocks of a product containing a lemon eucalyptus oil extract called citriodiol. But questions remain over its effectiveness  with British officials refusing to reveal any evidence it would work. After the news emerged  Public Health England confirmed the government’s guidance does not include using any such substance to protect against Covid-19 infection. Similarly  the World Health Organization said there was no evidence the virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes and that an insect repellant would therefore be ineffective. The use of citriodiol to prevent infection does not form part of its advice. “To protect yourself  clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also  avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing ” it said. It is understood that officials are in the process of buying stocks and plan to issue them to members of the army’s 20 000-strong Covid support force. According to a Sky News report  a source suggested it would be optional  additional to other measures. The broadcaster quoted an anonymous source as saying that  while the repellant may not help protect anyone  it is unlikely to harm them and  therefore  does not present a risk. The broadcaster added that personnel will also be given a disinfectant to use on themselves before washing and vitamin D supplements to support their immune systems. The measures do not replace physical distancing and other government advice  it said. An MoD spokesman said: “The protection and wellbeing of armed forces personnel is a priority. To help them remain healthy and available for duty the MoD is considering what additional measures can help their immune systems to stay fighting fit.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a3d62c7a666a43bc70e32bce4a2826fe98ea724/0_59_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d688d9cb33e018de649df013680400c9 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb8390f2e23d37f591f480337887d2adb8da84c/840_0_2450_1471/master/2450.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=946fd1c86f8843dd4bb97b0570041c8a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7fc738b561bf6392d54f992f60fcd7089c376c8/0_122_2814_1687/master/2814.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32bf81a0bf1b1958494b311e5a554dab https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f054dbd5a21869dc20ac26a222e599c55caab63/0_272_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad53f145a3f36651b92408e7ba9b1336 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2278c20a417c4332e340806b38a351a4f672c2f2/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a8326d47ead3929d96c1f51d705242c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CMilitary%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/vodafone-exec-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-video-revealed-pastor-luton-jonathon-james,world, Revealed: 'former Vodafone executive' in 5G conspiracy video is UK pastor, Jonathon James is previously unidentified individual who reached millions with false claims about Covid-19, In reality  the Guardian can reveal  the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy. Jonathon James  who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire  is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G. “It has nothing to do with biological warfare but is our bodies reacting to radiofrequency radiation ” he told listeners to the 38-minute recording  claiming the real cause of global deaths was new mobile technology causing cell poisoning. “They are using coronavirus to try to hide the fact that people are dying from the 5G frequency.” Although James was not the first individual to attempt to connect the pandemic and 5G  the popularity of his recording grew at the end of last month  just as people believing the conspiracy theory began to burn down phone equipment and harass telecoms engineers. In the recording he suggests that Bill Gates is involved in a plot to produce coronavirus vaccinations that will contain computer chips to track individuals  a move he claims will ultimately herald the destruction of society. “The coronavirus is not what’s killing people  it is clearly  categorically  unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people ” he told his audience without any evidence. “God has blessed me with the ability to bring disparate pieces of information together that puts the puzzle together and makes sense of it.” Although many copies of the recording have been deleted by YouTube for breaching its policy on dangerous disinformation  new uploads continue to be available. Delivered in the form of a sermon  it has also racked up millions of views across other networks and continues to circulate on WhatsApp. But until now the originator’s identity has been unknown. Much of the audio clip’s claims to credibility rely on James’s assertion that he is the former head of the largest business unit at Vodafone  supposedly giving him the inside track on new technologies at one of the world’s biggest telecoms companies. Vodafone insiders told the Guardian that while James had worked for the company  he was hired for a sales position in 2014 at a time when 5G was not a priority for the company and was unlikely to be in his remit. They said he ultimately left Vodafone after less than a year. Despite this  many of the leading online anti-5G groups repeatedly refer to the supposed censoring of a “former Vodafone boss” as a key source backing up their beliefs  with the recording spreading out of the UK and reaching large audiences in the US and Nigeria. International radiation watchdogs have cleared 5G as safe  while NHS bosses have called on people to stop spreading rumours linking the pandemic to 5G and threatening vital infrastructure. James’s identity was ultimately pieced together by researchers at the fact-checking startup Logically  working in conjunction with the Guardian. When the preacher was contacted he said he “was absolutely shocked that [a] somewhat ‘private message’ to a dedicated small community went viral and [was] ubiquitously covered [on] various social media platforms”. The preacher  whose WhatsApp profile picture shows him relaxing on a private jet wearing a monogrammed shirt  said: “For the record  I certainly wasn’t trying to vilify  incriminate or implicate any mobile network operator for their commercial endeavours to roll out their unified telecoms and next generation of mobile topologies in this regard. “Had I known my voice note would have gone to a wider audience I certainly would have contextualised my thoughts  been more specific on what I was sharing citing references  and far less explicit. I was simply trying to summarise what the ‘perceived truth’ was behind this bizarre pandemic in the interest of serving my community.” James  who regularly preaches at the Light City Christian Ministries in Luton  has apparently had a varied career since his time at Vodafone. He claims to have at one point advised central bankers in “the Congo” and Bangladesh on cryptocurrencies and he has posed with the South African president  Cyril Ramaphosa. In 2018 he was working as an economic adviser for a Zimbabwean opposition party  urging it to save the economy using Bitcoin-type products pegged to diamond deposits through blockchain technology. Asked if he had any final comment  James said he was unable to reply as he “had some rather pressing head of state engagement necessitating my full attention and time [for the] last 48 hours”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672306bb7d85152101e9291c1d04421824a19043/0_124_1418_851/master/1418.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6221fabe8caf2c9fffcdb15def6f84c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2C5G%2CLuton%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/dyson-will-not-supply-ventilators-to-nhs-to-treat-covid-19,world, Dyson will not supply ventilators to NHS to treat Covid-19, Engineering firm has been told by the government that their services are no longer required, Sir James Dyson  the company’s billionaire founder  said the company had already spent around £20m on the project but would not be seeking any public money to cover its costs. The government had lodged a provisional order with the company for 10 000 of a prototype ventilator called the CoVent  which the company designed in a fortnight. The order was conditional on the device receiving regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). While the MHRA is not thought to have rejected the CoVent  approval was expected to take some time and the NHS’ need for ventilators has so far proved lower than the 18 000 that health secretary Matt Hancock said might be required. “[Our] people welcomed the government’s challenge ” said Dyson  after the Daily Telegraph reported his company had been told to stand down. “Mercifully they are not required  but we don’t regret our contribution to the national effort for one moment. I have some hope that our ventilator we may yet help the response in other countries  but that requires further time and investigation. “The team have worked 24/7 to design and manufacture a sophisticated ventilator in a short timeframe – I hope they can spend this weekend with their families who will not have seen them for weeks.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “A number of devices are […] going through the necessary tests for regulatory approval. No decisions have been made on those devices and we will provide an update in due course.” The government commissioned several companies to supply 10 000 brand new ventilators each  awarding contracts to Dyson  defence company Babcock and a Cambridge-based group called Sagentia  a subsidiary of Science Group. But none of the companies has so far received regulatory approval for new devices. Dyson’s is the second project to be abandoned  after an effort involving the Renault and Aston Martin Red Bull Formula One teams was stood down due to a change in the specifications set by the government for new devices. The only group to have secured regulatory approval and supplied ventilators to the NHS in significant numbers is Ventilator Challenge UK  a consortium of manufacturers that focused on scaling up production of proven devices  rather than building new ones. The consortium has delivered more than 250 to the NHS  expects to reach production of 1 500 by early May and could supply up to 20 000 devices made by Oxfordshire specialist Penlon and Luton-based Smiths Medical. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9068355584a131e06f4e55894132d077847ccb3b/0_139_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31f6e7015d0c8cf398f04163654b77ba https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/238140503c709e23e5b0cac6740ad123937d76ff/81_0_2399_1440/master/2399.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4a295ee9652d2368526bc7881c5b08d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CWorld+news%2CScience%2CBusiness%2CJames+Dyson%2CDyson+Ltd%2CTechnology https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/who-will-be-entitled-to-a-coronavirus-test-under-new-uk-rules,world, Coronavirus tests: who qualifies for them now – and how do I apply?, Matt Hancock is aiming for 100 000 tests a day after including English key workers in target, Hancock is desperate to meet a target for testing 100 000 people per day by Thursday 30 April but appears a long way off achieving that. On Wednesday there were only 23 560 tests  still below an interim target of 25 000 tests by the middle of April. The 100 000 target has been dismissed as arbitrary and overambitious  but Hancock is determined to meet it. He claims the criteria can be expanded because there is now greater capacity for testing but too few people have been coming forward for tests. These would be tests for whether people currently have the virus  not antibody tests to show if people have previously been infected. Not yet  but Hancock claims the government is on course to meet the target in terms of capacity  if not the tests themselves. On Thursday he said capacity had increased overnight from 40 000 to 51 000 tests  which he claimed was ahead of schedule. Yes  according to Hancock. “Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test ” he said. Initially only patients in hospital could get tests. When Hancock pledged the 100 000 target by the end of April  he also announced plans to test NHS staff. Later he broadened the criteria to include care home staff. Up to 10 million essential workers and their families in England who are showing symptoms of coronavirus. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff  the list includes teachers  judges  some lawyers  religious staff  and journalists providing public service broadcasting. Also included are local civil servants  police  armed service personnel  fire and rescue service staff  immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets  those in food production  essential financial services and information technology  as well as those working in the oil  gas  electricity and water sectors. Employers of essential workers will be able to apply on the government’s website to get a test for any of their staff. From Friday any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on the website themselves. Hancock said: “This also applies for people in essential workers’ households too who need a test.” After entering your details on the government website  essential workers will then get a text or an email inviting them for an appointment. After taking a test  results will be sent out by text or email within about two days. Those testing positive with mild symptoms will be expected to follow the government’s isolation guidelines. There are regional test sites in around 30 locations across England  with more planned. The army will be providing mobile testing sites in more remote areas. And Hancock also promised home testing kits. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMatt+Hancock%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/no-checks-to-be-made-on-essential-worker-status-for-uk-covid-19-tests,world, No checks to be made on essential-worker status for UK Covid-19 tests, Government says booking system relies on public honesty rather than employment checks, Ministers said they were trusting the public to be honest about applying for essential worker tests. This leaves the system open to abuse  with one man who successfully applied for a drive-in test minutes after the scheme opened saying “any Tom  Dick or Harry” can get a test. The government insisted there was no evidence that high demand for tests was linked to fraudulent applications. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  promised on Thursday that up to 10 million essential workers and their families would be able to apply for a drive-in test or home-testing kit from 6am on Friday. Within two minutes  all the 5 000 available kits had been ordered. The government was forced to apologise after high demand for the drive-through appointments ran out before 8.30am. There was also a “technical problem” with the government website shortly after 8am. The transport secretary  Grant Shapps  said during the daily press conference later that 16 000 testing slots had been booked on Friday and dismissed suggestions that the website allowing critical workers to book tests had crashed: “We’ve seen in the last few days this difference between the capacity available (I think the last figure I saw was 51 000) and the number of tests done (28 000 yesterday)  and how important it is to make sure we’re using that available capacity  people being able to book online directly – that’s all the critical workers  10.72 million people with their families  are those who are able now to use that site. “I can tell you  16 000 of those [tests] were booked during the first period of that being online and the site has actually been brought back up around now for more people to go and book tests. It will then close off again  more tests will become available tomorrow and so on.” But it will be impossible to gauge whether only essential workers will benefit  as Hancock promised. Applications for a fresh batch of kits and drive-through appointments will reopen at 8am on Saturday. A spokesman said the government was relying on the public to be honest. “As with many aspects of the coronavirus response  we would expect the public to respond in good faith and that is what they have done with other aspects of the scheme and I think we would expect it to be the same here ” he said. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “It is a good thing that demand has been high and that 20 000 additional people are going to get a test. There is no evidence that the high demand is linked to people pretending to be key workers.” The problems with the website took the gloss off Hancock’s launch of the self-referral system  which he said was “critical” to increasing testing. One man whose wife is a primary school teacher expressed concern that no employer details were required in the application process. The man  who did not want to be named  said: “There was no requirement to put in my wife’s employers’ details. All she had to do was just choose a sector she was in and put in her name [and] date of birth.” The couple  who applied just after 6am  were given an appointment for a drive-through test at a lorry park in Portsmouth later on Friday. He said: “She is going to take her school ID just in case  but it doesn’t ask for that  so anybody could be doing this – it’s just open to any Tom  Dick or Harry.” A medical engineer from north-west England who had developed a cough said he successfully booked a test but could not take it up because he did not own a vehicle. “If I’ve got Covid-19 I don’t want to ask someone to drive me there ” he said. “So at the moment if you don’t have a car you can’t get a test. And there was no way of cancelling the test that they set aside for me  so they can’t make it available for someone else.” Hancock said he was still confident the government would meet his target of 100 000 tests a day by next Thursday. “The reason that the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month was because we’ve been building these systems to automate the testing  automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed. So we’re ahead of the plan  but you know  many a slip between cup and lip.” Shapps said getting “somewhere near” the 100 000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. “I think that if by the end of the next week  the end of the month  we’ve got somewhere near that goal of 100 000  I think in comparative terms internationally I think that’s a very high number.” He said there were now 31 regional drive-through sites for testing. The shadow health secretary  Jonathan Ashworth  said that questions needed answering as to “what mechanisms are in place to ensure everyone who needs a test gets one quickly  and whether a workable tracing strategy is being prepared.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15cc5f76deb1e2edd0146bc357f4960800cb081a/0_0_5204_3124/master/5204.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d5a79341842f6ebd6a14a0777b99be0a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path,world, The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine – a perilous and uncertain path, The pressing need to find a solution to the pandemic means risks and shortcuts may have to be taken, Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University’s human trials this week has to be put in context  and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood. The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell  but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill. So what is the path to success? Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus  similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future  helping prevent actual illness. The approach has led to some of our best vaccines  but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won’t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly – especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease. A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach. The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn’t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship  the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19  this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions  known as spike proteins  that form a halo or “corona” around the virus. Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists’ creativity in developing this defence. Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace  going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later. But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed  as this week’s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers. And then  potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found  who gets it first? First into clinical trials  just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January  was the US biotech company Moderna  with its RNA vaccine. RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA  coiled up inside the nuclei of cells  to the cell’s protein-making factories outside the nucleus. In this case  the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London’s team  this week backed by £22.5m government funding  is also developing an RNA vaccine  but in a form that hasn’t been tested before in people. “Some groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies ” said Prof Robin Shattock  who is leading the Imperial team. “We don’t have that luxury. It’s probably cost us one or two months  but it’s much better to be cautious and be sure you’ve got something that’s really safe.” Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics  and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert. Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don’t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as “non-replicating viral vectors”. These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases  such as Ebola  and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers  ready to go. A third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio  a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product  but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month. Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells  which gets transcribed into messenger RNA  which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein. This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade  but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important . “Clearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today ” said Joseph Kim  Inovio’s CEO. “But I think it’s just a matter of time.” Finally  a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself  and injects a dose directly into people. This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s  while GSK is providing an ingredient  known as an adjuvant  that boosts the immune response  which has also been tried and tested. It’s too early to say which option looks the most promising  according to Richard Hatchett  chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi)  which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates. “Some vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic  others have tremendous potential to scale up ” he said. “And the challenge that we face is that there’s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You’re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.” A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects. There is a chance none of them will work. For some illnesses  including other circulating coronaviruses  the immune system wages its battle  then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others  like chicken pox or mumps  trigger lifelong immunity. The truth is we’re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies. “Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year ” according to Marcus Lipsitch  a professor of epidemiology at Harvard  whose team recently predicted that  in the absence of a vaccine  social distancing may need to continue until 2022. “On the long end  it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.” On the positive side  Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically  meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter. This isn’t the case for flu  which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year. There are also questions around the type of immunity required. The body overcomes illness through antibodies  which see off the virus itself  and killer T-cells  which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses  antibodies do the heavy lifting  but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people. “An ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells ” said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines  which are delivered outside of cells  meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited. There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt  simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. “You need a certain hit rate in the population you’re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability ” said Miles Carroll  head of research at Public Health England’s National Infection Service at Porton Down. The possibility of “challenge trials”  in which people are deliberately infected  have been considered  but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. “There’s a lot of interest in this … because it would really accelerate vaccine development  but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting ” said Prof Andrew Pollard  chief investigator on the Oxford study. Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference. Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial’s RNA vaccine candidate  which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body. “We can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material ” said Shattock. “Many other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It’s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we’ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.” “If our vaccine were shown to be successful  if everything goes well – and that’s still a big if – we could deploy it in the UK this winter ” said Shattock. “All these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.” By September there could be a vaccine – maybe several – that appear broadly safe and effective. That’s not enough to get a vaccine licensed  but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups  potentially including millions of health workers  under “emergency use” rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval. There are precedents for this – in the 2018 Ebola outbreak  more than 200 000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019. “That might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people’s home  to say that for you  because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated  the risk-benefit balance is favourable ” said Sandy Douglas  an Oxford vaccine researcher. But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past – recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix  given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009  which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55 000 jabs. The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical  Douglas added. “In this case  that would include the fact that if you’re being offered a vaccine in October that didn’t exist in April  there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience  although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.” Individuals could be faced with tough choices – take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection. At the moment  many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine  but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK  as a joint force  are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support. But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety  so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021. Others urge a unified approach; governments  the UN  the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges. National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains. “If vaccine nationalism asserts itself  you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population ” said Hatchett. “It’s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can’t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can’t deal with this one country at a time.” Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. “In global health terms that’s a very big number ” he said. “But if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy  then that’s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that’s a really good investment.” • This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell  rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in “The frontrunners” section. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/04/12/Hannah_Devlin,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ca4791da48d463d45435ff32737863 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614a5bcdc09c3ad290c9fb323ac205de75a3982b/0_93_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aed24d45f7488240bd3a6b4cc05213e0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f/0_144_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=164bf677cb07108fbe8844eef927be26 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc/0_172_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f153a7d0a8cee8662854ce42f2b278de https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041/0_224_3582_2149/master/3582.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7db5b42cecad251e7af4e8fb448f41b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CMicrobiology%2CScience%2CWorld+news%2CResearch%2CPharmaceuticals+industry%2CHigher+education%2CEducation%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CVaccines+and+immunisation%2CHealth%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant,world, Coronavirus: medical experts denounce Trump's theory of 'disinfectant injection', Doctors warn US president’s musings on disinfectant as a cure for coronavirus could lead to death, At Thursday’s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing  the US president mused on new government research into how the virus reacts to different temperatures  climates and surfaces. Trump said: “And then I see the disinfectant  where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute! And is there a way we can do something like that  by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So  that  you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds interesting to me.” Dr Deborah Birx  the taskforce response coordinator  remained silent. But social media erupted in outrage at the president  who has a record of defying science and also floated the idea of treating patients’ bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light. Several doctors warned the public against injecting disinfectant or using UV light and a leading household cleaner manufacturer urged users not to inject it into their bodies. Reckitt Benckiser  the British-based maker of Dettol and Lysol  said in a statement: “We must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection  ingestion or any other route).” Political commentators joined the condemnation. Robert Reich  a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary  tweeted: “Trump’s briefings are actively endangering the public’s health. Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don’t drink disinfectant.” Walter Shaub  the former director of the Office of Government Ethics  added: “It is incomprehensible to me that a moron like this holds the highest office in the land and that there exist people stupid enough to think this is OK. I can’t believe that in 2020 I have to caution anyone listening to the president that injecting disinfectant could kill you.” Trump was already facing a backlash over his championing of hydroxychloroquine  an anti-malaria drug  as a therapy for the coronavirus  a quixotic effort amplified by the conservative network Fox News. Research has found no evidence that it is beneficial and a government vaccine expert has claimed he was fired for limiting its use. Undeterred  on Thursday Trump showcased an “emerging result” from Department of Homeland Security research that indicates coronavirus appears to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight  heat and humidity  raising hopes that it could become less contagious in summer months. Bill Bryan  the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology  said at the briefing: “Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus – both surfaces and in the air. We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well  where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus.” Researchers found that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions  and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise. Bryan said: “The virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.” He showed a slide summarising the results of the experiment that were carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. He also said tests had been carried out with disinfectants and isopropyl alcohol  specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids. “And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds  and that’s with no manipulation  no rubbing – just spraying it on and letting it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We’re also looking at other disinfectants  specifically looking at the Covid-19 virus in saliva.” Trump seized on the findings to refer back to a claim he made on 14 February that warm weather might kill the virus  like common flu  noting that he had been criticised by the media. “I think a lot of people are going to go outside  all of a sudden  people that didn’t want to go outside ” he said. And he asked Bryan an extraordinary question: “So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of  if you’re totally into that world  which I find to be very interesting. So  supposing we hit the body with a tremendous – whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light – and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked  but you’re going to test it. “And then I said  supposing you brought the light inside the body  which you can do either through the skin or in some other way  and I think you said you’re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.” Bryan responded: “We’ll get to the right folks who could.” UV rays are an invisible type of radiation that can penetrate and damage skin cells  and overexposure can cause skin cancer. How much sunlight would be needed to have an effect on the coronavirus is unknown. The virus has caused heavy death tolls in warm-weather areas such as Louisiana and Florida  and Singapore has seen a recent surge in cases. A Washington Post reporter asked if it was dangerous for Trump to make people think they would be safe by going outside in summer heat. The president turned to Bryan and said: “I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. “Maybe you can  maybe you can’t. Again  I say  maybe you can  maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor.” In a cringeworthy moment  he asked Birx if she had ever heard of heat and light in relation to the coronavirus. “Not as a treatment ” she said  explaining that the body responds to the virus with a fever. When the Post reporter pressed further  Trump retorted: “I’m the president and you’re fake news … I’m just here to present talent  I’m here to present ideas.” Experts questioned why the homeland security report had been promoted at the briefing. Dr Irwin Redlener  the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University  told MSNBC: “Everything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent  nonsensical  not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying. “First of all  people do get Covid  have been getting Covid in warm climates. Second of all  this issue with UV light is hypothetical  but also UV light can be very harmful and we did not hear anything resembling a balanced discussion of what the evidence is for and against UV light  but it’s certainly not ready for prime time.” He added: “The very fact that the president actually asked somebody about what sounded like injecting disinfectants or isopropyl alcohol into the human body was kind of jaw-dropping.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcba6d89643c2c0095044f7e6a6ce9a0d975e2af/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dba43f2bc16754ced0cdc509a04d0f73 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDonald+Trump%2CTrump+administration%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus,world, Revealed: leader of group peddling bleach as coronavirus 'cure' wrote to Trump this week, Mark Grenon wrote to Trump saying chlorine dioxide ‘can rid the body of Covid-19’ days before the president promoted disinfectant as treatment, In his letter  Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide – a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk – is “a wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body”. He added that it “can rid the body of Covid-19”. A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter  Trump went on national TV at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus. To the astonishment of medical experts  the US president said that disinfectant “knocks it out in a minute. One minute!” He went on to say: “Is there a way we can do something  by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs  so it’d be interesting to check that.” Trump did not specify where the idea of using disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from  and the source for his notion remains obscure. But the Guardian has learned that peddlers of chlorine dioxide – industrial bleach – have been making direct approaches to the White House in recent days. Grenon styles himself as “archbishop” of Genesis II – a Florida-based outfit that claims to be a church but which in fact is the largest producer and distributor of chlorine dioxide bleach as a “miracle cure” in the US. He brands the chemical as MMS  “miracle mineral solution”  and claims fraudulently that it can cure 99% of all illnesses including cancer  malaria  HIV/Aids as well as autism. Since the start of the pandemic  Genesis II has been marketing MMS as a cure to coronavirus. It advises users  including children  to mix three to six drops of bleach in water and drink it. In his weekly televised radio show  posted online on Sunday  Grenon read out the letter he wrote to Trump. He said it began: “Dear Mr President  I am praying you read this letter and intervene.” Grenon said that 30 of his supporters have also written in the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action to protect Genesis II in its bleach-peddling activities which they claim can cure coronavirus. On Friday  hours after Trump talked about disinfectant on live TV  Grenon went further in a post on his Facebook page. He claimed that MMS had actually been sent to the White House. He wrote: “Trump has got the MMS and all the info!!! Things are happening folks! Lord help others to see the Truth!” Paradoxically  Trump’s outburst about the possible value of an “injection” of disinfectant into the lungs of Covid-19 sufferers came just days after a leading agency within the president’s own administration took action to shut down the peddling of bleach as a coronavirus cure around the US. Last week the US Food and Drug Administration obtained a federal court order barring Genesis II from selling what was described as “an unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19”. The FDA also ordered a disciple of Genesis II  Kerri Rivera  to remove claims that MMS cured coronavirus from her website. Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning urging Americans not to buy or drink MMS  which it said was a “dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects”. Drinking MMS can cause nausea  diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death  the federal agency said. The Guardian contacted the White House asking whether Grenon’s letter had influenced Trump’s comments on disinfectant  but did not immediately receive a response. Another advocate of bleach as a miracle cure who has been seeking to interest Trump in the treatment is Alan Keyes. He is a former ambassador and adviser to Ronald Reagan who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for the US Senate and on three occasions for the US presidency. Keyes has featured Genesis II bleach products as a miracle cure on his online conservative TV show  Let’s Talk America. It is not known whether Keyes has discussed MMS with Trump. But the two men have overlapping interests. Not only have they both featured in Republican party and presidential politics  but they were both leading proponents of the Birther conspiracy theory that wrongfully suggested Barack Obama was born outside America. Keyes’s TV show is hosted on IAMtv  a rightwing web-based channel. IAMtv’s other leading anchor is Bob Sisson  who has also advertised Genesis II bleach products on air. In one of his shows  first reported by the Daily Beast  Sisson held up two bottles of Genesis II MMS and said: “Gonna meet Trump  it’s only a matter of time. President Trump’s gonna invite us up there  when he finds out about this stuff.” On Friday Trump claimed he was being “sarcastic” in his remarks but there is no evidence to back up that claim and he appeared entirely serious as he made them. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355ed881c8b7e9bcb5f97ac1e34ffb2894ece36d/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5590be9ae5994788d21d69176d3f1222 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDonald+Trump%2CUS+news%2CFlorida https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-sparks-perfect-storm-of-state-led-disinformation,world, Malicious forces creating 'perfect storm' of coronavirus disinformation, Russia and China among state and other actors spreading fake news and disruption  say experts, In the midst of a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people  analysts have witnessed a sharp rise in deliberate misinformation campaigns on social media  which have occurred in parallel with attempts to hack international organisations at the forefront of the coronavirus response. Senior executives from Facebook  Google and Twitter are scheduled to appear before UK MPs next Thursday to answer questions about the spread of coronavirus disinformation. A report published by the EU on Friday accused Russia and China of targeting European citizens  including Britons  during the pandemic  and provided a range of examples. Echoing other experts  the bloc’s foreign affairs wing  the European external action service  said there had been a “proliferation” during the month of April. “Despite their potentially grave impact on public health  official and state-backed sources from various governments  including Russia and – to a lesser extent – China  have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighbourhood ” the report sad. In the last week alone reports have emerged of hacking attacks on the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health. The WHO has reported a fivefold increase in cyber-attacks on both itself and on the public. While some of the activity has been criminal  or linked to “dark PR” firms who work with governments and the far right  other attempts to sow discord have been laid at the door of governments – including disruptive messaging to US mobile phones that has been blamed by US officials on China. In that incident  according to the New York Times  millions of mobile phone and social media accounts were bombarded with fake messages in March  including one saying the Trump administration was about to deploy troops to enforce a lockdown. While Russia and China have been the focus of scrutiny for some of the attacks  others have originated in the US and mirror misinformation and untruths propagated by Donald Trump and some of his most prominent supporters in the US media. The EU report examined material published in nine languages and found that even fact checkers were being fooled by false or highly misleading content that was reaching millions of people on social media. EU officials cited the fact that a third of UK citizens believe that vodka can be used as hand sanitiser as an example of the effectiveness of the disinformation. Conspiracy theories about 5G telecommunication masts facilitating the spread of Covid-19 were also being boosted by actors seeking to promote false narratives  the report said. “In the period covered by this report  it was confirmed that pro-Kremlin sources and Russian state media continue running a coordinated campaign with the twofold aim of undermining the EU and its crisis response  and to sow confusion about the origins and health implications of Covid-19/coronavirus”  the report said. The WHO and its director general  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  have been among the main targets for digital attacks since the outbreak began. The attacks have included racial abuse and the publication of cartoons of Tedros  an Ethiopian microbiologist and diplomat  as a dog on a lead being held by the Chinese president  Xi Jinping. Earlier this month  Tedros said he had been subjected to racism and death threats and said many of the attacks had originated in Taiwan  which has complained of being excluded from critical WHO deliberations. Tedros noted that Taiwan’s foreign ministry had not disassociated itself from the attacks  an observation Taipei rejected as “slander”. The attacks appear to have gathered momentum since Trump began blaming the WHO for the slow US response to the pandemic. First Draft  a nonprofit coalition investigating internet disinformation  carried out an analysis of 15 000 tweets in the week beginning 14 April which used the hashtags #tedrosresign and #tedrosliedpeopledied. About a sixth of a sample of 1 200 accounts contained the tag #maga  associated with Trump supporters. “Around 10% of accounts using hashtags attacking the director general were created in the last six months  the majority of those in 2020 ” First Draft said. Ron Deibert  the director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto  which studies digital threats to civil society  told the Guardian that while the rise in malign online activities reflected often different behaviours and interests  together they amount to a “perfect storm” of disinformation. “It’s hard to quantify how widespread it is but there is a threat analyst group I know of tracking 12 nation states and other organisations  both public and private  [who] are reporting a sharp increase. Deibert cautioned that such campaigns have been seen before  even in the pre-internet era  around for instance well-documented attempts by Russia to spread disinformation blaming the US for Aids. But a combination of global connectivity and anxiety has amplified the intensity of the disinformation war over Covid-19. “This is a global event that touches everyone directly ” Deibert said. “The heightened level of anxiety means citizens are dependent on getting access to health information  often working at home. That anxiety means people are more likely click on something malicious. “We’ve been tracking it closely and you can see several different strands connected in various ways. There are different aims and different technologies. But what you can say is they all work in a communications ecosystem which  by design  has created an environment almost irresistible to malicious actors trying to manipulate  confuse and spread disinformation. Everyone is trying to further their strategic aims.” Paul Barrett  a New York University expert in disinformation and fake news  has identified similar trends and said that some malicious actors are feeding off each other’s disinformation for their own ends. “It’s a three-ring circus of disinformation ” he said. “It is almost impossible to pick out one strain and isolate it  because simultaneously Russian and China and Trump are getting in on the act and imitating each other more and more. It is incredibly difficult for an ordinary citizen to navigate what’s true.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc640b85dfe81feb20d2717a2187292c25d056a3/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0f5f5b16b2af7cc9aaa02e36f257499 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CInternet%2CTechnology%2CCybercrime%2CWorld+news%2CCyberwar%2CEspionage%2CHacking%2CSocial+media%2CRussia%2CChina%2CUS+news%2CDonald+Trump%2CMedia%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+Health+Organization https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sweden-queries-basis-of-lockdowns-as-germany-keeps-its-guard-up,world, Sweden queries basis of lockdowns as Germany keeps its guard up, Looser regime means Sweden is better placed to face second wave  says chief epidemiologist, As several European countries continued to cautiously lift lockdowns  sending children back to school and reopening some shops and businesses  Sweden’s chief epidemiologist  Anders Tegnell  said their original measures looked difficult to justify. Sweden has favoured civic responsibility over mandatory rules  closing senior high schools and banning gatherings of more than 50 people  but asking rather than ordering people to avoid non-essential travel  work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or feeling ill. Shops  restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Polls show many Swedes support the policy  although the interior minister  Mikael Damberg  and the mayor of Stockholm  Anna König Jerlmyr  urged people not to relax as the weather turned warmer  warning that bars and restaurants that did not follow physical distancing recommendations risked being shut down. The strategy has also been heavily criticised by some senior members of the country’s scientific community and the country has recorded 2 150 deaths – giving it a per-million total much lower than Italy’s and Spain’s  but many times higher than those of its Nordic neighbours. Tegnell said in an interview with Nature magazine that it was “difficult to talk about the scientific basis of a strategy with these types of disease  because we do not know much about it and we are learning as we are doing  day by day”. The epidemiologist added: “Lockdowns  closing of border … Nothing has a historical scientific basis  in my view. We have looked at a number of EU countries to see whether they published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they started  and we saw almost none.” He told the BBC Sweden’s strategy meant it was better placed to face a second wave of the outbreak  because scientists estimated between 15% and 20% of the population were now immune – enough to slow and control the spread of the disease further. The strategy had worked in the sense that its aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so the country’s healthcare system did not become overwhelmed  he said. Sweden’s relatively high death toll was because “as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly  which have banned visitors” so it was “hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that”. In Germany  Lars Schaade  the vice-president of the country’s infectious diseases agency  the Robert Koch Institute  said citizens “should not lower our guard now”  echoing an earlier warning by the chancellor  Angela Merkel  that the country risked rushing out of lockdown and squandering its achievements so far. Germany  which last week allowed smaller stores  car and bicycle dealers and bookstores to reopen provided they observed strict distancing and hygiene rules  has recorded 150 383 cases and a relatively low death toll of 5 321. But Schaade said he was opposed to any further relaxation until the number of new daily infections fell. “It is a paradox that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very same measures are now being called into question ” he said. “More contact will mean more infections … which  in the worst case  could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.” Meanwhile  media in Italy – whose 25 000 coronavirus deaths represent the second biggest tally in the world after the US – said the government was set to gradually begin easing Europe’s longest and toughest lockdown  in place since 9 March  over the course of the next four weeks. “The next four Mondays will mark the country’s reopening ” the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. The country’s economy would emerge from lockdown at intervals from 27 April  it said  beginning with some factories  followed by clothing and other shops and concluding on 18 May with bars and restaurants. The economy’s gradual reopening would be accompanied by strict hygiene and physical distancing measures  the paper said  with only one customer at a time allowed in shops smaller than 40 sq metres and bars and restaurants obliged to keep a distance of one metre between clients. There was no official confirmation. Spain  which has Europe’s second highest death tally with more than 22 500 fatalities  hailed the fact that for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak  more people were now being diagnosed as cured than those falling sick. “With all the effort that we have put in  the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be ” said Fernando Simón  the health ministry’s emergency centre coordinator. Officials from the country’s 17 regions and central government were to meet later on Friday to discuss easing its six-week lockdown. In France  where schools and shops are due to begin reopening from 11 May  the finance minister  Bruno Le Maire  said on Friday no decision would be taken on bars and restaurants before the end of next month. “Nothing would be worse than to make a hasty reopening which would then force us to close again ” Le Maire said. The Czech Republic unexpectedly opened its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister  Adam Vojt?ch  said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine. Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June  but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country  with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather compared with a previous limit of two. Restaurants and pubs can fully reopen on 25 May  two weeks earlier than initially planned.

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nursery-but-not-as-they-knew-it-norway-adjusts-to-life-after-lockdown,world, Nursery  but not as they knew it ... Norway adjusts to life after lockdown, As the country follows Denmark in easing Covid-19 restrictions  pre-school has become very different for its younger citizens, Yellow smileys painted on the tarmac reminded everyone to keep 2 metres apart. Louise and Jonas were happy to be back  their father even more so: the family went into lockdown barely a day after the parents’ wedding. “It’s been a case of adjusting  to say the least ” said Bugge. “The challenge of working from home and looking after two small children has been immense. But we’re still married.” Several Covid-19 cases at his workplace forced them to isolate early. But as younger children in Norway this week followed some of those in neighbouring Denmark back to kindergarten  not all parents were relieved  despite the assurance of the education minister  Guri Melby  that “going to pre-school is safe”. As in Denmark  a Facebook group  “My child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19”  has been set up  and thousands have signed an online petition objecting to the reopening. A poll by the broadcaster NRK found 24% of parents did not want to send their children back to nursery and 13% were unsure. Those who did return found much had changed: no more toys from home; specially installed handwashing facilities outside; staggered drop-off and pick-up times; no parents in the school building. Once past the gates  children must spend the day in the same small groups of three or six  depending on their age. Pupils at Norway’s primary schools start returning from 27 April as the country  which has recorded nearly 7 500 cases and 194 deaths  reopens after a month of restrictions. Many shops have been allowed to stay open  but bars and most restaurants will remain closed and cultural and sporting events are banned until at least 15 June. At the Hullebergmyra pre-school  Tor Garshol  a teacher  said he had stayed in touch with children and parents online during the lockdown. Online videos produced by the education ministry have taught children what to expect and how to react. “We’ve also provided parents with ideas for activities as well as communicating visually with the children ” he said. Lena Løvik  the headteacher  said that while the children would spend most of their time outdoors  the school’s interior had been divided up into smaller areas and was subject to strict hygiene rules. “We’re loaded up with disinfectants  soap and paper towels ” she said. Surfaces and toys are thoroughly cleaned twice a day  and children taught what to do in terms of personal hygiene and physical distancing. Most seem familiar with the requirements; there is even a corner to go and cough. “Our view remains: focus on the children  not the virus ” Løvik said. She said the school community had been through a process of “speed digitalisation”  with online platforms allowing parents  teachers and children to stay connected and continue working. “The extraordinary circumstances have made us all more competent and actually brought us closer together in many ways ” she said. Denmark reopened schools and daycare centres last week after a month-long lockdown  but concerns that they might become breeding grounds for a second wave of cases have convinced many parents to keep their children at home. “I won’t be sending my children off no matter what ” said Sandra Andersen  founder of the Danish “My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig” Facebook group  which has more than 40 000 followers. “A lot of parents are thinking  ‘Why should my little child go outside first’.” The prime minister  Mette Frederiksen  defended the reopening for younger children  undertaken on the health authority’s recommendations  saying it would allow parents to return to work and “get the economy going again”. Christian Wejse  a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University  told Reuters he understood people’s concerns “because we’ve spent a month trying to avoid contact”. But any new infections would not cause problems in an age group “where few fall ill  and those who do won’t get very sick”  he said. Looking at neighbouring Sweden – which has kept its primary and junior schools open – it appeared that children were not major transmitter of the virus  Wejse said. In Denmark  as in Norway  strict rules apply in nurseries  where non-washable toys are banned and a small section assigned to each group of children. Authorities have recommended a floor area of 6sq metres per child for nurseries  2 metres between tables  and expect staff to supervise regular handwashing and disinfect surfaces such as taps  toilet flushes  tables  and door handles twice a day. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b715a36dd180e5c3347ad400983f1453d48ad8f/0_87_2599_1560/master/2599.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4109d6eb09a6c0d0920fa63c25f7ffb6 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5945e46fc13bef5b2df72f97b37d619b0f827abf/0_79_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0724bf6377c9eb34e502a1e1b4a359a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Norway%2CDenmark%2CSweden%2CEarly+years+education%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CChildren%2CEurope%2CEducation%2CSociety%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis,world, Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?, Plenty of countries with male leaders have also done well. But few with female leaders have done badly, Jacobs did not want to impose a strict lockdown  but she did want physical distancing observed. So she spelled it out: “Simply. Stop. Moving ” she said. “If you don’t have the bread you like in your house  eat crackers. Eat cereal. Eat oats. Eat … sardines.” The 51-year-old Caribbean premier may not have the global profile of Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern  but her blunt message exemplified firm action  effective communication – and showed another female leader getting the job done. From Germany to New Zealand and Denmark to Taiwan  women have managed the coronavirus crisis with aplomb. Plenty of countries with male leaders – Vietnam  the Czech Republic  Greece  Australia – have also done well. But few with female leaders have done badly. Ardern  39  New Zealand’s premier  has held Kiwis’ hands through the lockdown  delivering empathetic “stay home  save lives” video messages from her couch and communicating daily through non-combative press conferences or intimate Facebook Live videos  her favourite medium. Her insistence on saving lives and her kindness-first approach – urging New Zealanders to look after their neighbours  take care of the vulnerable  and make sacrifices for the greater good – has won her many fans  while her emphasis on shared responsibility has united the country. Choosing to “go hard and go early”  Ardern imposed a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering the country on 14 March and implemented a strict lockdown two weeks later  when fewer than 150 people had been infected and none had died. New Zealand has recorded just 18 deaths; public trust in Ardern’s government is greater than 80%. In Germany  Angela Merkel has been hailed for direct but uncharacteristically personal public interventions  warning that up to 70% of people would contract the virus – the country’s “greatest challenge” since 1945 – and lamenting every death as that of “a father or grandfather  a mother or grandmother  a partner …” Thanks to extensive testing from the outset  plenty of intensive care beds  and the chancellor’s periodic forthright reminders that Covid-19 was “serious – so take it seriously”  Germany has so far recorded fewer than 5 000 deaths  a far lower figure than most EU countries. With a doctorate in quantum chemistry  Merkel’s clear  calm expositions – a clip of her explaining the scientific basis behind the government’s lockdown exit strategy was shared thousands of times online – have also helped propel public approval of the fourth-term chancellor’s handling of the crisis above 70%. In nearby Denmark  meanwhile  the prime minister  Mette Frederiksen  acted equally firmly  closing the Scandinavian country’s borders as early as 13 March  and following up a few days later by shutting all kindergartens  schools and universities and banning gatherings of more than 10 people. That decisiveness appears to have spared Denmark the worst of the pandemic  with fewer than 8 000 confirmed cases and 370 deaths. Frederiksen’s no-punches-pulled speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised. She even managed to show a sense of fun  posting a clip on Facebook of herself doing the dishes while singing along to the 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation’s weekly TV lockdown singalong. The Scandinavian country’s youngest-ever prime minister  whose approval ratings have doubled to more than 80%  has now begun easing its lockdown. Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen responded equally fast  activating the country’s central epidemic command centre in early January and introducing travel restrictions and quarantine measures. Mass public hygiene measures were rolled out  including disinfecting public areas and buildings. In all  Taiwan adopted 124 control and contain measures in weeks  making a full lockdown unnecessary. It has reported just six deaths  and is now dispatching millions of face masks to the worst-struck parts of the US and Europe. Tsai’s warm  authoritative style has won her plaudits  even from political opponents. Norway  with 7 200 cases and 182 deaths  this week began relaxing its restrictions by reopening kindergartens. The prime minister  Erna Solberg  told CNN she had made a point of “letting scientists make the big medical decisions”  adding that she thought her country’s early lockdown and thorough testing programme had been key. Following an example set earlier by Frederiksen  Solberg also took the unusual step of directly addressing the country’s children  telling them in two press conferences – from which adult journalists were banned – that it was “permitted to be a little bit scared” and that she  too  missed being able to hug her friends. Meanwhile  Iceland  under the prime minister  Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s  leadership  has offered free testing to all citizens  not only those with symptoms  and has recorded 1 800 cases and 10 deaths. Some 12% of the population has taken up the offer  and an exhaustive tracing system has meant the country has not had to close schools. Finland’s prime minister  Sanna Marin – who last year became the world’s youngest head of government – also moved decisively to impose a strict lockdown  including a ban on all non-essential travel in and out of the Helsinki region. This has helped her country contain the spread of the virus to just 4 000 cases and 140 deaths  a per-million toll 10 times lower than that of neighbouring Sweden. Not all the women who have excelled in the corona crisis are national leaders. Jeong Eun-kyeong  the unflappable head of South Korea’s centre for disease control  has become a national icon after overseeing a “test  trace  contain” strategy that has made the country the world’s coronavirus role-model  with daily infections in single digits and a death toll of less than 250. Jeong  a former rural doctor dubbed “the world’s best virus hunter”  has delivered no-nonsense daily press conferences  including demonstrating the ideal way to cough. While these have won praise  her work ethic – she has left an emergency operations bunker only for quick visits to a food truck – has prompted concern for her health. Whatever conclusions we may draw from these leaders’ performances during the pandemic  experts caution that while women are “disproportionately represented to a rather startling degree” among countries managing the crisis well  dividing men and women heads of state and government into homogenous categories is not necessarily useful. Complicating factors may be at play. Kathleen Gerson  a professor of sociology at New York University  notes  for example  that women leaders are more likely to be elected in “a political culture in which there’s a relative support and trust in the government – and that doesn’t make stark distinctions between women and men. So you’ve already got a head start”. In addition  it may be harder for men to escape “the way they are expected to behave” as leaders  Gerson told The Hill website. And since the very best leaders are both strong and decisive and capable of displaying feeling  women could  perhaps  “lead the way in showing that these are not competing and conflicting attributes  but complementary – and necessary for good leadership”  she said. • This article was amended on 28 April 2020.

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nova-scotia-shooting-gabriel-wortman-replica-police-cruiser-girlfriend,world, Nova Scotia gunman used fake police cruiser to flag down victims, Gabriel Wortman also beat and handcuffed his girlfriend before the shooting  police said  which might have been ‘the catalyst’, Gabriel Wortman – who killed 22 people on Saturday and Sunday – also stole weapons from a police officer he murdered  switched vehicles and changed clothes to elude capture during his 12-hour killing spree. The grim details emerged on Friday as police released their first detailed timeline of Canada’s worst mass shooting. “I’ve been a police officer for almost 30 years now and I can’t imagine a more horrific set of circumstances  when you’re trying to search for someone that looks like you ” Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Supt Darren Campbell told reporters. “Obviously that was an advantage the suspect had on the police  on the public – and on every person he encountered through the course of his rampage.” Police said that before the shooting  Wortman beat and handcuffed his longtime girlfriend in a “significant assault”. Campbell said that an argument between the two might have been “the catalyst of events” over the weekend. The first victim found by police on Saturday night was a driver with a gunshot wound in the rural town of Portapique  set in thick forest. Fanning out across the crime scene  officers found several buildings on fire – and 13 other victims. Authorities soon realized the suspected gunman owned several decommissioned police cruisers  but officers initially mistakenly believed all were accounted for. Two were found on fire at his house  and officers in Halifax located the third at another one of Wortman’s properties. “We weren’t aware at that particular time and came  and became known to us later that he had a fourth vehicle ” said Campbell. “And that was the vehicle that he was using during his rampage.” It wasn’t until Wortman’s girlfriend escaped into the woods and contacted police  that they learned of the fourth vehicle. The police response was also hobbled by a mistaken belief that a single country road was the only way in and out of the first crime scene. It was not until a second wave of emergency calls on Sunday morning that officers learned that the suspect had escaped and was more than 60km away  Campbell said. “Our investigation has revealed that the gunman attended a residence on Hunter Road in the Glenholme area. At that location  the gunman killed two men and one woman and he set the residence on fire ” he said. “At least two of the victims were known to the gunman.” Wortman then went to another house  whose residents he knew. But as they saw him dressed as a police officer and brandishing weapons  they refused to answer the door  instead calling 911. Wortman then continued down the highway  at this point using his replica police vehicle to pull over drivers. “Witnesses described that the suspect had pulled over one of the vehicles and then shot one of the drivers ” Campbell. “He continued driving down that same highway and he encountered his second vehicle and he shot and killed that victim.” Police also gave the first detailed account of the death of constable Heidi Stevenson  a 23-year veteran of the RCMP. Stevenson and a colleague  constable Chad Morrison  both hunting for Wortman  had agreed to meet at a highway intersection. When a white vehicle with police markings approached  Morrison thought it was Stevenson. “The approaching police vehicle was actually driven by the gunman  said Campbell. “The gunman pulled up beside constable Morrison and immediately opened fire ” wounding Morrison. Morrison sped off  but Wortman then collided with Stevenson as she arrived at the scene in her cruiser. He shot her dead and stole her weapon and ammunition  before killing a passerby in a silver SUV. Wortman then set Stevenson’s patrol car and his own replica cruiser on fire  stealing the SUV from his latest victim. He drove a short distance to the house of a woman he knew  fatally shooting her. He then changed out of his police uniform  placed his weapons in her vehicle  and went towards a nearby gas station in the town of Enfield. Officers filling up an unmarked vehicle saw Wortman and drew their weapons. “There was an encounter and the gunman was shot and killed by police at 11.26 in the morning ” said Campbell. Police are still investigating how Wortman was able to obtain a number of firearms – a mix of pistols and long-barrelled guns. Only one of weapons has been traced back to Canada. The rest are believed to have originated in the United States. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/569c9eded6adce8328ca1eff160bc81f465a6190/86_0_3318_1991/master/3318.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e86bc69a180ae759e1a80d266c765b20 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Canada%2CGun+crime%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/nova-scotia-shooting-canada-new-details,world, Twelve hours of terror: how the Nova Scotia shooting rampage unfolded, New details have emerged in Canada’s worst mass shooting  raising fresh questions about the attack and authorities’ response, “Is there also a structure fire out this way?” one first responder asked his dispatcher. “We’re seeing huge flames and smoke.” Soon afterwards  when a number of gunshot victims were found  an emergency worker asked if the gunman had been detained. “No  not for sure ” the dispatcher replied. “They don’t know if they’ve caught him.” Audio recordings from the night of 18 April capture the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty as emergency teams grappled with the Nova Scotia mass shooting. The confusion partially explains how a dental technician named Gabriel Wortman was able kill at least 22 people  including a police officer  firefighter  nurse and teacher. For more than 12 hours  the gunman evaded police  traveling across the province before he was shot dead outside a gas station. As Canada reels from the worst mass shooting in its history  new details of the slaughter and its aftermath have emerged – raising fresh questions about the shooting and the response of the emergency services. Among the revelations is the fact that for nearly seven hours  authorities did not realize the murderer was disguised as a police officer and driving a replica police cruiser. Clinton Ellison and his brother  Corrie  were staying at their father’s home in Portapique when they heard a single gunshot on Saturday evening. Heading outside to investigate  the brothers spotted a large fire up the road. Corrie walked ahead  but he soon called his brother and told him to contact the fire department. When Corrie failed to return home  Clinton followed his path towards the smoke and found his brother’s body in the road. “I shut my flashlight off  I turned around – and I ran for my life in the dark ” Clinton told CBC News. Sprinting as fast as possible  Ellison turned up the driveway of a cottage. “I turned around and looked towards the road I had just run from to see a little flashlight flashing around  looking for me ” he said. Realizing the gunman was searching for him  Ellison ran blindly into the woods. For nearly four hours he hid among the trees – praying for help amid bursts of gunfire and explosions from the fires – before officers led him to safety. “To walk up and find my brother dead  and to be hunted by this fella that killed all these people  I’ll be traumatized for the rest of my life ” he said. Police have not yet identified the first victims  but a number of news outlets reported on Friday that it was his longtime girlfriend  who he assaulted and handcuffed following an argument. The woman  who has not yet been identified  survived his attack and managed to escape  hiding in the woods for hours as gunshots rang out in the dark  before finally emerging and contacting police. It was then that authorities received their most critical tip: the woman told authorities that their suspect in the shootings was dressed as a police officer and driving a replica police vehicle. She provided the RCMP a photograph of the car  kicking off the frantic  hours-long search across the province for Wortman. The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  Brenda Lucki  has said that several of the victims were known to the gunman – but that he later simply opened fire at anyone in his path. Late on Saturday night  an officer in tactical equipment arrived at Nathan Staples’ house to check on the Glenholme resident. “He came to apologize. He said: ‘We’re sorry we couldn’t have been there quicker.’ That’s when I got angry ” Staples told the Globe and Mail  uncertain why he was being visited by police. On Friday  the RCMP said that a number of people had been approached by officers who they believed might have been in danger. “We were contacting individuals who we believed could have been on a list or were potentially at risk ” RCMP superintendent Darren Campbell told reporters on Friday. “We were contacting them  we were bringing them to safety and we were interviewing them at that time.” During the manhunt  two officers discharged their weapons at a fire station in the town of Lower Onslow  leaving a string of bullet holes in the facade. Several people were inside the building but the suspect was not known to be in the area at the time. The serious incident response team – an independent body that intervenes after police shootings – is investigating. “We don’t know what they were firing at ” the SIRT director  Pat Curran  told the Toronto Star. Nearly 12 hours after police received their first 911 call  the murder spree came to an end at a gas station outside the town of Enfield  more than 50 miles from where the first victims were found. Jonathan Heffernan  a firefighter at the Halifax international airport  had pulled in to refill his truck. Thanks to the coronavirus lockdown  the station – usually bustling on a Sunday morning – was largely empty  but the quiet was soon punctured by an exchange of gunfire. “I had no idea what was going on ” Heffernan told the Guardian. “A guy was running around the corner of the building. He yelled to me that someone was shooting. We both hid behind my truck. We still had no idea what was happening. “I’ve been a firefighter for 14 years. Absolutely the most terrified I have ever been.” The two hid behind Heffernan’s truck as heavily armed police swarmed the area and helicopters circled overhead. Ten minutes later  the two men were told they could safely come out of hiding. It wasn’t until later that Heffernan realised that he knew one of the victims: Tom Bagley  a volunteer firefighter whose generosity and unflinching kindness were praised by friends and colleagues. “Learning that a former member of our fire family was also killed just added to the emotion ” said Heffernan. The maritime province has been deeply shaken by the killings. “There are just so many pieces left to pick up before people can even begin to start grieving ” said Tiff Ward  a lifelong resident of the region who knew several of the victims. Police believe Wortman acted alone – although they are investigating whether he was helped in obtaining firearms and the police uniform. The RCMP said Wortman did not appear to have a firearms licence. Because the coronavirus pandemic has prevented mass gatherings  community members have a planned an online vigil for Friday evening  said Ward. “Everybody’s dropped their work and they’re bringing their very best self too ” she said. “And we need this. We need a really big light to shine up into the biggest darkness imaginable.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca0928a366548cd2f46a832b01f1bb26291917f7/0_304_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fab81c569fcd0a41ee9caacb52da9432 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84164167b763b5b02b9aef6569b0be4425727d85/0_46_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10f7766efacb076fb5327217482c9a27 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Nova+Scotia+shooting%2CCanada%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CNova+Scotia https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/will-shoppers-return-to-the-uk-high-street-after-lockdown,business, Will shoppers return to the UK high street after lockdown?, Retailers fear the coronavirus pandemic could permanently change consumer habits, But there are growing fears that the lockdown may prompt huge changes in the way we shop  ushering in an era of fewer shops  more home deliveries  more local shopping and changes in the way we buy fashion. The temporary closure of the high street has “shaken people’s reality”  says retail analyst Richard Lim  adding that the situation has forced consumers to reassess how and what they buy: “Most people have no experience of this kind of disruption so it’s shaping their perception of what’s possible.” British retailers were battle weary after 2019 which was their worst on record. Sales fell for the first time in 24 years as growth in online shopping failed to offset the downturn on the high street and shoppers spent spare cash on leisure and experiences rather than clothes and homewares. It is estimated that the financial reckoning faced by the retail sector will result in 20 620 store closures this year – up from about 16 000 in 2019 – and trigger nearly 250 000 job losses  according to a new analysis based on a three-month lockdown by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Prof Joshua Bamfield  the CRR’s director  said the coronavirus was a “hammer blow” for retailers: “We expect more companies to go into administration followed by the current pattern of an acquirer purchasing a small number of well-performing stores plus the brand names and the rest of the stores to remain unsold.” The toll on jobs will be substantial. The demise of Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston alone has cost 3 000 jobs. Britons were already enthusiastic online shoppers but retailers including the John Lewis and Curry’s PC World chains reported a near doubling of online sales since the quarantine began  and Bamfield predicts that rapid growth will continue  causing even “greater problems for bricks-and-mortar stores”. This week Sharon White  the John Lewis group’s chairman  said the company feared sales at its department store chain could fall by a third this year despite increased sales through its website. The financial pressure created by the abrupt shutdown has already put Debenhams into administration for the second time in a year. White  who had warned of looming store closures and job losses before the pandemic said she would now have to consider “changes in consumer behaviour to come out of the pandemic  such as a more pronounced shift to online and a desire to shop in more sustainable ways”. Lim  who runs the consultancy firm Retail Economics  predicts the crisis will hasten changes already under way  resulting in half of all non-food spending moving online – up from around 30% today. Before the pandemic  only 7% of groceries were bought online – though capacity has doubled in recent weeks – whereas half of all electricals and books were already bought on the web. Lim says Covid-19 has forced shoppers who had never shopped on the internet to give it a try. “Sections of society are being forced to go on a customer journey they wouldn’t otherwise have embarked on. People who couldn’t be bothered to try online shopping are getting past the initial friction of setting up an online account and inputting their payment details.” Lim also believes the enforced holiday from consumption could lead to reduced materialism. “Two decades of importing deflation from China means we have had price falls in retail categories like clothing and footwear ” he said. “Arguably we’ve got an abundance of material possessions and we attach less economic value to certain products.” “The pause for reflection that consumers are making at the moment could lead to a reassessment of what’s important ” says Lim. “If I have sat here for the last three months and I haven’t bought a new pair of shoes or a handbag maybe it wasn’t as important as I thought it was?” Consumers may need coaxing back to shopping centres with financial incentives and reassurances that it is safe. In China  the authorities have been giving away shopping vouchers to encourage shoppers back into the malls. In Dubai  the reopening protocols for retailers include thermal scanners at mall entrances  time-limited shopping sprees and signs outside indicating when the safe limit of customers has been reached inside. Closer to home Curry’s intends to offer a “drive-through” service in its car parks for those who no longer want to linger. Primark  which is losing £650m in sales for every month its stores remain closed  said this week that it expects shoppers to be cautious about returning. John Bason  finance director at Primark’s owner  Associated British Foods  said he didn’t “expect deserted high streets to just go bang” but that trade would build over time. Diane Wehrle  insights director at Springboard which specialises in tracking shopper numbers  said that smaller high streets had hung on to more shoppers than bigger towns as people stayed local  but she does believe that shoppers will return to bigger towns and cities “if things work out and we don’t get a second rush of cases”. Springboard is working on an occupancy alert service for centre owners so they can use technology to manage crowds and keep shoppers in the loop. “Malls will need to be able to track occupancy ” said Wehrle. Customers will be kept up to date via social media. This week B&Q reopened 155 stores with “strict” safety measures that will make visiting a DIY retailer a chore even for the most avid enthusiast. Retailers such as John Lewis and Marks & Spencer will have a head start when the time comes to reopen as they have been able to use their food businesses to devise workable social distancing measures. Shopping for pleasure seems a lifetime ago. Amid fears that some high street brands may be forced to close permanently under the UK lockdown  the Guardian asked readers about how they think their shopping habits may change after the lockdown ends.  Breaking the takeaway coffee habit Andy Lee  36  from Warrington  estimates he will save about £50 a month. “I was spending so much money in Starbucks ” said Lee  who works as a local government worker. “My other half and I have discovered Nespresso though  and are using around 15 capsules a day between us.” “I can’t see myself going back to takeaway coffee but I miss not having meals out. It’s a bit embarrassing but the first thing I want to do after lockdown is get a McDonald’s.” Sarah Crooks  who lives in the Peak District  will also be be giving up her takeaway coffee habit. “Before I must have bought up to 10 coffees a week  often accompanied by a biscuit  cake or a sandwich ’” said the lecturer  who is in her mid-50s. “I did it so often that it was almost a reflex. “Breaking the habit and saving so much money is one of the positive side-effects of all this.” Fewer clothes – but more online Sharanya Basu Roy  29  an associate lecturer from Derby  said: “The lockdown has definitely made me less materialistic. I will be reducing my spending on eating out  clothing and fashion accessories. They are not environmentally sustainable and there are things in life that are more important.” Anna Oldbury  43  a food producer  from London. “I will definitely spend less on seasonal garments and fast fashion ” she said. “I’m not likely to shop on the high street anymore when you can buy it all online. However  I do still want to support independent shops and boutiques.” Shopping locally A 54-year-old reader from Buckhurst Hill  who preferred not to give her name  said she had a poor experience with one of the larger supermarkets getting deliveries organised for her elderly father  but that local retailers had helped. “I understand it’s a terrible time but smaller companies have really stepped up to the mark and I’d rather support them. They’re also more likely to need our custom to survive this.” Richard Stone  43  a managing director of a PR consultancy firm from Stafford  said he would also be shopping and eating more locally. “Our local plastic-free supermarket has been delivering throughout the crisis and when it’s over I plan to use them even more. “When the lockdown is over  I plan to visit all the local shops and restaurants I love  providing they’ve survived the pandemic – to help support them. I live in a small county town and if you don’t use it  you lose it  from a retail perspective.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcf6424158f70d8a6bba4763de08a06e71f8b63/0_276_3917_2350/master/3917.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0f6b0e64eb40f9491790976c1a806d8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dccbdef5eaf34688676f9a17d543a7f1f40125d7/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be21e5d237a8443e3db5ecef03592574 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc80bddd32a3a6fdcc0b4f50bd2d24efb73d43/0_63_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12967cd260e14ebccee49f998b60bd03 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9afa9833b957e328089cab6973de72fe16d116/461_51_3571_2973/master/3571.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e138eaacb32a07c08cef7695f6726107 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Retail+industry%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CConsumer+spending%2CLaura+Ashley%2CJohn+Lewis%2CStarbucks%2COnline+shopping%2CConsumer+affairs%2CEconomics%2CFood+%26+drink+industry%2CMoney https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/uk-lockdown-sends-retail-sales-to-record-low-but-alcohol-sales-rise,business, UK lockdown sends retail sales to record low  but alcohol sales rise, Economists predict bigger fall in April after panic-buying prevents larger March slump, Amid concerns the economy could experience its biggest contraction in several centuries  the fall in retail sales of 5.1% compared with the previous month exceeded the already downbeat expectations of City analysts  who forecast a 4% slide for March. Only panic-buying of food and freezers before the lockdown and household goods purchased bought online prevented a bigger slump  leading to predictions of a fall of up to 30% in April when the full impact of the government’s restriction measures will be felt. The Office for National Statistics said store closures had hit sales of furniture and home furnishings and especially clothing  which dived by 35% month on month. Petrol sales declined by 19% month on month. The latest blow to high street sales came after a torrid 12 months in which many chains have gone to the wall and others shut stores in towns across the country. Before the lockdown  retailers’ profit margins had been hit by a combination of competition  rising business rates and escalating rents. Brexit uncertainty  which dampened consumer confidence  had also hit sales of “big ticket items” such as cars. Last month the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  announced a raft of measures to protect businesses from the worst of the Covid-19 fallout  including a business rates holiday. On Friday  the government banned commercial landlords from “aggressive rent collection”. This should help many retailers that have fallen behind with payments over recent months. But the measures are not expected to prevent a further decline in the number of businesses on the high street after the lockdown is lifted. Shoppers  who have become used to shopping online  may continue to maintain deliveries of food and other items instead of visiting bricks and mortar shops. Revealing a strong divergence in sales  food  household goods and other non-food items all increased sales by value on the month by 15.3%  18% and 16.4% respectively  the ONS said. Supermarkets reported a strong increase in volume sales  at 10.3%  while off-licence sales of alcohol soared 31.4% in volume terms. Online sales jumped to more than 22% of all sales  compared with an average of 18% over the last year. Department store sales rose by 2.8% month on month  though the increase appeared to be due to purchases of food and other items online. The ONS said: “Comments from food store retailers suggested that panic-buying  or stockpiling during the coronavirus pandemic  was a big factor in the increased sales  particularly for supermarkets.” The ONS also confirmed that April was likely to bring even bigger falls. It said retailers responded to its survey between 1 March and 4 April 2020  meaning that two weeks of the five-week trading period were under physical distancing measures introduced before the lockdown. Thomas Pugh  an economist at consultancy Capital Economics  said: “With widespread lockdowns only beginning around the middle of March  retail spending looks like it will fall by much more in April  perhaps around 20-30% month on month. “Clearly there is huge uncertainty as to how deep the downturn proves and how long restrictions remain in place  a fall in the region of 25% in GDP over the next few months seems likely.” ?Ian Geddes  head of retail at Deloitte  said that while a rush to remote working fuelled sales of home office equipment  and consumers bought home gym equipment  the situation was dire for many retailers. “The combination of a UK-wide lockdown  closure of many physical stores  and consumer confidence at a historic low  has posed a significant challenge to all retailers  albeit with differing consequences across retail sectors. “Those trading in essential goods  particularly food  have seen sales increase by 3.9%  month-on-month  while the non-food category has seen the greatest decline as lockdown measures pressed an indefinite pause on the UK high street.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321a7cbaa7ad67b55ddfccc395eebacf4499e270/0_137_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5aa9b322fc8c3b5dc3e63f18459f5b76 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Retail+industry%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CSupermarkets%2CAlcohol%2COffice+for+National+Statistics%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/uk-treasury-mulling-government-backed-loans-smallest-firms,business, Treasury mulling 100% government-backed loans for smallest firms, Proposal follows slow take-up of bank lending by companies during Covid-19 crisis, The chancellor  Rishi Sunak  is believed to be close to making a decision about adapting the current scheme  which has come under criticism in the last week from business lobby groups  former chancellors and the governor of the Bank of England. Thousands of businesses have complained that the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS)  which is run by the British Business Bank  is cumbersome and includes financial hurdles that many businesses are unable to overcome. Currently  the government underwrites 80% of the value of the loan but is now giving serious consideration to raising that to 100%  in a development first reported by the Financial Times. The Institute of Directors has joined the CBI in calling for 100% state-backed loans to circumvent onerous commercial bank lending rules  saying this would unlock a system that is currently expanding at a slow crawl. The former chancellors George Osborne  Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid and the shadow business secretary  Ed Miliband  have called on Sunak to move to 100% government-backed business loans. The Treasury has already had to change its criteria to get money out more quickly to businesses that may otherwise fail to survive the lockdown. It has banned personal guarantees that put business owners’ property at risk  and scrapped a controversial requirement for banks to offer loans at commercial interest rates – reportedly as high as 12% – to any eligible businesses before offering a CBILS application. The latest weekly data released on Thursday by the banking lobby group UK Finance showed that lending under CBILS had reached 16 624 companies  which accounts for just 40% of the 36 000 formal applications lodged with banks so far. However  the amount of lending to small and medium-sized businesses under CBILS has more than doubled to £2.8bn over the past week. While approvals have increased from a rate of 21% a week earlier  critics are still concerned that banks are not able to get money fast enough to businesses that need it most. Germany and Switzerland have pushed out tens of thousands more loans to businesses after putting in place standard forms and common criteria for high street banks to follow. France has agreed €20bn (£17.5bn) of loans  which have a 90% state guarantee  to more than 170 000 businesses and expects to process a further €20bn by the end of the month. However  senior banking executives have played down the likely impact of the government giving 100% backing CBILS loans  claiming it would make no difference in the pace of approvals. “It wouldn’t have the impact that people think ” one senior banker told the Guardian. “The agreement with the government is very clear: we have to do our appropriate due diligence and ascertain that the business was a viable business pre-Covid.” UK regulations also require small business customers to undergo affordability checks so banks do not saddle them with an unaffordable amount of debt. Sources said those extra checks have “put off” some banks from offering loans worth less than £25 000. “So even if the government said [they would back the loans] 100%  the banks shouldn’t really be acting massively differently. I don’t think it would be good behaviour.” An executive at another major high street bank said the discussions about higher guarantees were a “distraction” in a wider debate about whether governments should be handing money directly to businesses. “An alternative would be a grant scheme where customers end up self-declaring their financial position through an application ” the banking executive said. In that scenario  banks would serve as a processing hub for government cash. “That’s a very different scenario which would be quicker for a borrower to access but clearly there are big implications in terms of what risk does the public sector and taxpayer take in this type of market ” the executive said. “If you want it to be quicker  faster  more straight forward  you therefore need to move away from the banks undertaking those credit checks ” he added. United States Washington’s Paycheck Protection Program is almost a hybrid of the UK’s CBILS and furlough schemes  providing forgivable loans that are meant to support worker pay. The PPP offers small businesses with less than 500 employees loans to cover staff wages for eight weeks  though a smaller portion can be used for mortgage interest payments  rent and utility costs  even if the companies remain shuttered. If all the criteria are met  the loans – which otherwise come at an interest rate of 1% – do not have to be repaid. The PPP was originally allocated $349bn (£305bn) but was increased by $320bn after the initial funding ran out out within two weeks of the scheme opening. More than 1.6m firms had loans approved. France France has so far agreed €20bn (£17.5bn) of loans to more than 170 000 businesses. It expects to process a further €20bn by the end of the month. In total  the government is backing up to €300bn of bank loans  with state guarantees ranging from 70-90%  depending on the size of the business. The loans are available to all firms  regardless of size  and are usually worth up to three months of the company’s revenues in 2019 and do not have to be repaid for up to 12 months. Like the UK  business are also being supported though a deferred tax payment arrangements and the government is also providing state subsidies for worker wages through employers during the lockdown. The French government has said it is willing to nationalise French companies if necessary. Germany Businesses have been able to apply for loans of up to €1bn  which are 80% and 100% guaranteed by the state depending on the size of the firm. The loans  which come with interest rates as low as 1%  are available to struggling companies that were viable before the Covid-19 outbreak. Depending on their size and creditworthiness  companies can access up to €1bn in emergency funding. While the process was working well for small businesses borrowing up to €3m  reports suggested there were initial difficulties in getting some loans out to larger firms. However  those hiccups seem to have been temporary. Authorities have also had to deal with fraudsters trying to exploit the generous programme  which has forced some German states such as North Rhine-Westphalia to temporarily suspend payouts. The total number of state-backed loans now approved in Germany – including between startups  medium-sized businesses and large companies – has reached 17 906 with €10.3bn (£9bn) granted to date  according to the German economic ministry. About 18 170 business have applied for emergency financing to date. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7fd339aad290b131a48a4b1c565afcda4335700/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84b1846bb9e7676bcc4fd69b490a4bb0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Small+business%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CRishi+Sunak%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CBusiness%2CGovernment+borrowing%2CEconomics%2CTax+and+spending https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/hays-travel-owners-no-regrets-thomas-cook-rescue-john-irene-hays,business, We'll survive! Why Hays Travel owners have no regrets on Thomas Cook rescue, Irene and John Hays remain upbeat about takeover of 555 branches six months before Covid-19 halted global travel, There was a widespread belief that the spectacular failure of the 178-year-old business showed that the traditional tour operator model was  in the words of Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary  “screwed”. Yet with their mixture of bonhomie and quiet confidence  underpinned by the enduring strength of their jointly owned business  Hays Travel  the married couple from Sunderland were beginning to win over the sceptics. Less than six months later  their deal of a lifetime has been cast into tumult by an unprecedented pandemic that has shut down global tourism indefinitely. Could this be the unluckiest timing in the history of deal-making? “Yes  it’s unfortunate ” says John Hays  with a degree of stoic understatement. “Two months ago things were going fantastically but it’s not anybody’s fault and in these circumstances  all you can do is make the best of it. “We’ll do what we can to protect our staff  protect the business and protect our customers. We’ve just got a positive attitude on life.” According to Irene  they have “no regrets” about buying Thomas Cook  even with the benefit of hindsight. And there are good reasons to believe them when they say they’ll survive. So far  two-thirds of the customers who have made a decision about holidays already booked have elected to reschedule  indicating a rebound next year if and when things return to normal. The duo’s optimism is also founded in part on the manner in which they had run their business before the pandemic struck. Hays Travel is a different animal to the souped-up  debt-fuelled  bonus-happy beasts of the City  such as Thomas Cook and Carillion. The travel agent and tour operator has no debts and the couple haven’t paid themselves a dividend for more than 10 years. “When you look at our balance sheet it’s incredibly strong and there are no shareholders to satisfy  just John and I ” says Irene. When it became clear that they were going to be badly affected by the outbreak  they both moved themselves on to the national minimum wage. “We said we’d work for nothing and then our payroll said they’d have to make us redundant in that case  so we changed our minds ” said John. Their mantra has been to “share the pain”. Landlords  including those owning the former Thomas Cook estate  have also shown willingness to do that  offering rent holidays on their travel agency premises. Yet it has proved impossible to protect their 5 700 staff entirely. Before the chancellor had announced a package of financial support for businesses  the Hays’ were left with little choice. They put essential staff on half pay while others had their hours cut  including 880 who went on to zero-hours contracts. “That was a really hard day ” says Irene. “We announced that personally on a video. It was really sad.” Now though  staff have been moved on to the government’s furlough scheme  which pays 80% of wages. Up to half have come back to work and more are to follow. They are determined to avoid redundancies. “The prospect of those folk from Thomas Cook going through this twice in one year does not bear thinking about ” says Irene. As staff get used to working from home  rather than the high street  the day-to-day working life throws up challenges familiar by now to workers across many industries. “We’ve got conference calls where kids are coming in and out and dogs are barking ” says John. “Someone sent in a photo of her home office  which was a laptop on the ironing board.” Such challenges have been relatively easy to manage but others have not. Hays has its own tours business but also acts as a middleman between holidaymakers and third-party operators. Some are dragging their feet about refunds. “We’ve stood our ground and if our customers want a refund  we’ll fight for them to get one ” says John. “If the tour operator isn’t willing or able  we’re giving it [refund to the customer] and then trying to get it back.” A 40-year veteran of the industry  John is used to reacting to sudden and unexpected disruption. He has steered Hays through the impact of 9/11 and the volcanic ash cloud that shut down European airspace in 2010  not to mention the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. “This one is of a totally different magnitude to anything we’ve ever seen ” he says. “Sadly  many good viable businesses will go under.” Back in late February  the true scale of the disaster hadn’t dawned on them. “We were thinking then: ‘This could be a fly in the ointment ’” John says. “The first three weeks of February our sales were fantastic. Then the last week  things started slowing down really badly and then just took nightmare turns.” Irene recalls watching the news on 22 February and seeing that an Italian doctor on Tenerife had tested positive  with 1 000 guests at the hotel in Costa Adeje forced into quarantine. “We were mainly worried about the potential damage that it would do to Tenerife  which is so reliant on tourism. We were thinking: ‘What a tragedy for them’ without realising how it would escalate ” says Irene. Before long  they had their own customers stranded off the coast of Japan on a Princess Cruises liner that became the subject of global attention as passengers came down with the coronavirus. “They were in an inside cabin  allowed out for fresh air every couple of days  really incarcerated ” says John. “We were checking on them every day to make sure they were OK. We had a lot of sympathy … but a lot of people in small flats with kids are now going through the same experience.” Hays staff were soon working 12-hour days in a desperate effort to get clients home from every corner of the world. “It was like a tsunami coming at us ” says John. “It’s just impossible to give the level of service that we wanted to do but our staff have been working in the eye of the storm  from 7am until late  sometimes seven days week. “It makes you feel so humble. I’d walk through the floor and I just felt even more proud than I did before.” The response of their staff  they say  is another reason to be confident that they’ll make it. “We’re not fools ” says Irene. “We know how difficult it’s going to be. But we’ll get there.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ddcae6480be8b25d1deb538e076049bda6c32c/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9a6f855f148f0e28031600b4dff6dcc https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Hays%2CTravel+%26+leisure%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CThomas+Cook%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CCorporate+governance https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-refunds-fans-ticket-policies,money, Coronavirus refunds: why fans are raging over ticket policies, With thousands of live events axed or rescheduled  many fans are finding it tricky to get money back, Theatre and music fans whose plans have been dashed are reporting long waits for refunds  with some claiming that companies are trying to fob them off with credit vouchers rather than giving them their money back. With the original dates for some events having passed  ticket firms  promoters and venues have been contacting affected customers – but they often seem to be reluctant to address the “R” word: refund. The UK’s Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) – to which almost all leading ticket companies belong – has made clear that if an event is cancelled customers are entitled to a refund of at least the face value of the ticket. The same is true if an event has been rescheduled and you are unable to attend the new date. Some acts have avoided leaving fans in limbo. On Monday  Bon Jovi axed their 2020 tour  saying that cancelling  rather than postponing  “will enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries”. But many concerts and other events have been rescheduled for later this year or 2021  with existing tickets valid for the new date. Many fans will be happy to stick with their booking. Glastonbury has offered the 135 000 people who had paid a £50 deposit for this year’s event the chance to roll it over  guaranteeing the opportunity to buy a ticket for 2021’s festival. Given the annual scrum to buy tickets  the vast majority will probably do that. But some who bought tickets for an event are now in a much more difficult position financially and want their money back as soon as possible. One of the companies facing criticism is ATG Tickets  part of the Ambassador Theatre Group that operates dozens of venues including many West End theatres hosting shows such as The Lion King  Wicked and Pretty Woman: The Musical. Many ticketholders have complained on social media that they have been waiting weeks for refunds. On Twitter there are scores of unhappy customers  some of whom say they have been sent credit vouchers they do not want. One  with the username Just Jack  claimed: “I’ve now had to ask @ATGTICKETS three times for a refund on my cancelled show from nearly three weeks ago because they’re dodging the issue or offering freebies so they don’t have to give me my money back.” The same day another  Dan Clarke wrote: “I made my refund request several weeks ago but have still had no reply.” AndMeg Potter tweeted: “I’ve been on hold for nearly an hour trying to get a refund for my performance that has been rescheduled for two years’ time! Is there any other way I can get my refund?” On the Theatreboard forum  several ATG customers have complained  including one who said he had about £500 worth of cancelled events and was still waiting for his money. Another called for people who were having problems getting refunds from the company to contact him as he was “looking to start [a] civil action against them”. ATG is responding to people on Twitter  telling them that if they have emailed in a refund request  this will be processed and they should disregard any vouchers. But you would not know that from the long statement and Q&A about Covid-19 on the firm’s website. At the time of writing it does not mention refunds once – it talks about either switching to a future performance or receiving a credit voucher. And calling the company is not easy: on Monday  Guardian Money rang customer services and was put into a queue. We gave up holding after 55 minutes. Asked about customer complaints  an ATG spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry about the delay. At the moment we are dealing with approximately 300 000 individual bookings  which means we are taking a little longer than we hoped to react to every customer. We have brought in additional teams to respond as quickly as we can.” ATG said it was prioritising ticketholders for performances that had been due to take place up to 2 May  so customers with events beyond that date may not have received an email yet. In the US  Ticketmaster has been at the centre of a row over allegations it changed its terms on refunds after the coronavirus shutdown began. While that relates only to the US  the Covid-19 statement on Ticketmaster’s UK website this week said little about refunds  other than that because of the high number of cancellations and rescheduled events  “we encourage you not to reach out directly with a refund request”. Again  unhappy customers have been tweeting about their experiences  with many saying they are waiting for refunds for cancelled perfomances and that their emails to the company have been ignored. Ticketmaster UK says that for cancelled events customers will automatically receive a refund on to the card they used to buy the tickets – they do not need to do anything. If a show is rescheduled  tickets will remain valid for the new date  though if the booker cannot attend they can ask for a refund. Ticketmaster says all refunds have either been processed or are being processed  and that for rescheduled shows  currently 98% of fans are opting to keep hold of their tickets for the new date. While scores of ticket companies and venues are signed up to Star and abide by its code of practice  there are smaller festivals  local theatre shows and other events where the organiser is not a member and will have its own terms and conditions. In some cases these will be facing a precarious future. Some people have donated the value of their tickets to venues to keep them going. Ultimately  if you want your money back and the firm cannot or will not pay up  you can turn to your credit or debit card provider to seek a section 75 claim or chargeback. This right could be useful if an event has been postponed but the firm goes bust before the show is due to take place. In terms of what is a “reasonable” period within which refunds have to be made  one ticketing expert says normally it would be about 14 days  however  these are extraordinary times. While many events have been cancelled  others are still scheduled to take place but with no guarantee that they will  leaving some ticketholders in a quandary. Some would argue that summer festivals now look less likely to take place after the government’s chief medical officer said on Wednesday that social distancing will be needed until at least the end of the year. At the time of writing  the Latitude festival in Suffolk was still scheduled to take place on 16-19 July  with headliners including Liam Gallagher and the Chemical Brothers. Inevitably  this is causing some concern. On 21 April  one fan  Elisa Schwarz  tweeted “… Latitude festival have mine and a lot of others’ ticket money and have not communicated with anyone if they will cancel and refund  £240 is a lot of money to some of us”. It is a similar story with the Reading festival  whose headliners include Stormzy and Rage Against the Machine. However  this event is scheduled for 28-30 August  so it could still proceed as planned. The websites of both festivals stated that the events would go ahead as planned  although the organisers were monitoring the official guidance from the relevant bodies. The Latitude website added that “there are no refunds  other than for cancellation or significant alteration of the festival”. The Reading website issued a similar warning. There is no guidance on how much notice of cancellation has to be given  though one small consolation is that in most cases  particularly with bigger shows  events are not being axed at the last minute. But for the time being  most ticketholders will have to wait and see.

25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/25/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-working-from-home-coronavirus-lockdown,technology, Best noise-cancelling headphones for working from home, Owning a decent headset can really help if you need some peace during the coronavirus lockdown, If you can’t get away physically  a set of noise-cancelling headphones could be just the ticket to isolate you just enough to concentrate. From amazing value to truly fantastic sound  at a price  here’s a guide to the best available. RRP: £50 Most cheaper noise-cancelling headphones are terrible  but the Lindy BNX-60 are actually pretty good. They’re a little old  originally released in 2016  but having been reduced to just £50 they offer incredible value. The noise-cancelling handles background drone fairly well  while the ear cups enclose your ears to help quieten the rest of the world. They have a reasonable set of controls on the outside too  but two different volume levels that can be a bit confusing. They’re a bit cheap-feeling  and fairly tight on the head. They also don’t fold up particularly compact for travel  which probably isn’t a concern right now. The battery lasts for up to 12 hours and charges via the older microUSB. You get a choice of a solid Bluetooth 4.1 connection  with support for AAC and aptX Bluetooth audio standards  or an included 3.5mm audio cable. They sound better with noise cancelling turned on with bright and punchy audio – better than you would expect for £50 – that’s a little over accentuated in the treble. Verdict: A cheap and cheerful bargain. RRP: £220 – deals from £170 Want noise cancelling without the bulk of headphones or a cable? Sony’s WF-1000XM3 are the best sounding  most effective noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds you can get. They feature impressive noise-cancelling technology that rivals the best full-size headphones. They sound fantastic  have steady Bluetooth connection with support for AAC  and solid touch-panel controls on each earbud that now include volume adjustment. The earbuds last up to six hours of continuous playback with noise cancelling active  with more than three full charges in the case for a total of 22 hours  all in making them some of the longest-lasting true wireless earbuds available. Built-in support for Google Assistant  Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri is the icing on the cake. All that technology makes the earbuds massive – but get the fit right and they’re worth it. They even undercut rivals on price too. Verdict: Amazingly effective noise cancelling without the bulk or wires. Alternatives: Libratone Track Air+ (£179)  Apple AirPods Pro (£250)  Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (£279) RRP: £250 – deals from £219 Bose pioneered the first noise-cancelling headsets in 1986 and has been a market leader ever since for good reason: its products offer excellent active noise cancellation. Now in their second iteration  launched in 2017  the QC35 II combine excellent noise suppression with good sound  simple operation  reliable connectivity and supreme comfort. Though they do not support the latest audio standards  they still have SBC and AAC and a stable connection. You can connect to two devices at once  such as your phone for calls and your computer for work  and the headphones last for up to 20 hours between charges. You can use a headphones cable too when the battery runs out. Good playback and volume controls  plus a button for adjusting noise cancelling or a voice assistant round out a simple  understated design. They are built to last  fold neatly for travel and sound pretty good too. The best bit is their unparalleled comfort: light and airy with good adjustments – ideal for long work days. Verdict: Effective  comfortable and built for the road. Alternatives: Jabra Elite 85H (£170)  Marshall Monitor II (£270)  Beats Solo Pro (£270) RRP: £350 If price is no object and you want the very best sound in a set of noise-cancelling headphones that will work wireless  wired and even over USB-C  with practically every option ticked including top-tier comfort  you want the B&W PX7 from the upmarket British manufacturer Bowers & Wilkins. The big  cushioned ear cups and padded headband provide all-day comfort. The noise cancelling is as good as Bose at blocking out the world  while the battery lasts for up to 30 hours. A 15-minute quick charge gives you up to five hours playback too if you run out. A rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connection is backed with the very latest in audio standards  including AAC for Apple devices and aptX Adaptive for Android or Windows. Plus they can connect to two devices at once  while call quality is great. For a cabled connection you have a choice of a standard 3.5mm audio cable or a USB-C cable straight from your phone  tablet or computer. The best bit is how they make whatever you are listening to sound: simply fantastic  producing the sort of quality audio that will enable you to discover new elements in well-worn tracks. Verdict: Big and expensive  but the PX7 are worth every penny. Alternatives: Sony WH-1000XM3 (£240)  Bose Noise-Cancelling Headphones 700 (£300)  Sennheiser Momentum 3 wireless (£300).

25/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/25/hope-savers-cuts-interest-rates-accounts-uk,money, UK savers urged to switch after brutal cuts to interest rates, Some accounts are now paying as little as 0.01% but there are still some reasonable deals to found, The financial information firm Moneyfacts said savings deals were being “pulled left  right and centre” as banks and building societies reacted to the emergency measures to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Providers have been cutting already low rates. For example  NatWest’s instant-access primary savings account currently pays between 0.1% and 0.25% depending on the balance. From 8 June this will plummet to a flat 0.01%. Best-buy accounts have also had a rates cut: on 17 April  the online provider Marcus  a division of Goldman Sachs  said it was trimming its savings account rate from 1.3% to 1.2%. However  that is still a top rate for an easy-access account. Rachel Springall  a finance expert at Moneyfacts  said: “If savers are hoping to secure an attractive rate  then applying quickly has never been so crucial. Savers must also review any accounts they currently have and switch if they are on a poor rate.” Vanquis Bank is paying 1.6% on its one-year fixed-rate account  while RCI Bank is paying 1.9% on its five-year fixed-rate product  according to Anna Bowes  the co-founder of the Savings Champion website. At the time of writing  the best savings rate available was with United Bank UK (UBL)  whose seven-year fixed-term deposit account pays 1.95%. However  this involves tying up your money for almost a decade  and the minimum deposit is £2 000. Someone putting away this sum would  at the end of the term  have a balance of £2 289. There was some good news a few days ago  when National Savings &and Investments said it was cancelling planned rate cuts on a range of its accounts and would delay plans to make its premium bonds prize fund less generous. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d048f4f09cfac43329c4cd27ae44922f82dc50/0_55_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e8ee6839e90f8bdb7c04837d85e426c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Savings%2CSavings+rates%2CBanks+and+building+societies%2CMoney%2CCurrent+accounts%2CConsumer+affairs%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
27/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/27/why-did-ryanair-stop-refunds-and-start-offering-only-vouchers,money, Why did Ryanair stop refunds and start offering only vouchers?, At first it said it would give the money back  but then it said this would only be after the coronavirus crisis, Today we received an email which seems to only offer replacement vouchers. In the small print  Ryanair states that it will only consider refunds after the Covid-19 emergency is over. Can I hold Ryanair to its original promise? KC  Enniskillen Readers have been contacting us in their droves this week asking exactly the same question. Having previously said it would offer refunds – and unlike the other airlines put in place a website to make it happen – Ryanair has now changed its mind. Instead of the refund  passengers have been sent a link telling them how to use its vouchers to purchase alternative flights over the next 12 months. They can still request a cash refund  it states  but will be placed “in the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed”. Readers are understandably frustrated and  in many cases  very angry. The rules are clear: full refunds are due if the airline cancels the flight  to be processed within seven working days. Clearly  the easiest option is to take the vouchers. But be aware that they are  inexplicably  only valid for 12 months. If you would prefer  or need  the money  apply to be put into the queue and see how it develops. Sooner or later  regulators are going to have to get involved in this dispute. In my view  the Civil Aviation Authority needs to give the airlines a month to start making refunds  and to warn those that don’t that they will have their licences to operate in and out of UK airports  withdrawn. However  the CAA does not have a great record in this area. The other option consumers have is to file a chargeback/section 75 claim request with their card provider. The banks will often try to bat these away  so you will have to persist. If the emails sent to us are anything to go by  consumer patience over this issue is starting to wear rather thin.

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/24/weatherwatch-thousands-in-lockdown-rescue-rainfall-records,news, Weatherwatch: thousands in lockdown rescue rainfall records, Climate scientists asked for volunteers to transcribe millions of UK rainfall measurements from 1820 to 1950. And they volunteered in their thousands!, So how does this compare to the UK’s wettest month on record: October 1903? The records show that 227mm of rain fell during October 1903  but the observations are not detailed enough to show precisely where and when the most intense rainfall occurred. That’s because thousands of meticulous weather observations are recorded in copperplate hand-writing  but haven’t yet made it to digital form. Now they have! A call for volunteers to use Covid-19 lockdown time to help rescue rainfall records has resulted in over 15 000 people transcribing all five million UK rainfall measurements recorded between 1820 and 1960  in the space of just three weeks. Once the data has been double checked scientists will be able to compare exceptional months like October 1903 and February 2020  and understand the variation in British weather.

On Thursday the government insisted it was on track to meet the target  increasing the tests from less than 10 000 at the start of April and just 23 000 tests on 14 000 people on Wednesday. Deloitte was hired to help scale up testing nationally  and is understood to be handling logistics across a number of the sites  working alongside other private firms such as Serco and Boots. Deloitte says it does not run or manage the testing centres  but supports the Department of Health. In revelations that raise concerns over the rapid outsourcing of testing during the pandemic  chief executives at hospitals in south-west London are understood to have had talks about removing Deloitte and running the Chessington drive-in testing centre themselves. The alarm was sounded when doctors and nurses complained that test results never arrived  or that they had been sent someone else’s results. In other cases  the test centre  which is about 12 miles south-west of central London  was unable to ring through with the diagnosis because of a failure to record correct phone numbers. In an email written in early April  and seen by the Guardian  the chief executive of Epsom hospital said: “Deloitte who have been commissioned by the Department of Health directly for this are not running this as well as we would like … [We] are asking whether we can take over the running of the Chessington centre because we really need it to work much better than it is.” It is understood that the request to remove the firm was made in the first week of April  but that it was set aside after performance improved. The Department for Health said late Thursday that 49 people had experienced delays  and 39 had now received their results. The ministry said it would continue to investigate the remainder and offer any workers still waiting a new test. “We are also implementing further processes within the department to ensure rapid investigation of outstanding test results that are not provided to those tested within 48 hours ” a spokesman said. However  Epsom hospital stopped sending staff to Chessington 10 days ago after finding a more convenient alternative  it said. Staff are now swabbed at work and the samples sent to the laboratory at St George’s hospital  south London for analysis. Epsom could soon be able to do the analysis itself  having ordered four machines made by a company spun out from Cambridge University  which can complete the process in 90 minutes. The Chessington centre’s problems appear not to have been entirely resolved. A paramedic for the south-east coast ambulance service  who asked not to be named  said he had been tested along with a group of colleagues on 3 April. They were still waiting to hear from Chessington. “None of us from my place of work  tested on that Friday  have had our results ” he said. “We were told our samples were taken to a lab in Southampton. It’s three weeks since the test and I don’t think I’m ever going to get the result. No one’s been in touch other than my managers to say they’re chasing it.” The paramedic questioned the involvement of Deloitte  which specialises in management consultancy  tax and accounting but has little experience in running public services. “I’m not sure what is essentially an accountancy company can bring to this.” A doctor at Epsom hospital  who was among the first to be tested at the end of March while self-isolating at home with symptoms  said she was still waiting to hear; after making enquiries she was told Deloitte could only release information to the person being tested  and not the organisation referring them. She has since been tested by her hospital. Asked to comment  Daniel Elkeles  who runs Epsom  and its sister hospital  St Helier  in Carshalton  Surrey  said there were “clearly teething problems at Chessington at the start of this contract”. “We are now assured that those teething problems are fixed and that the service is reliable. But it’s much more convenient for our staff to be swabbed [at the] Epsom and St Helier sites  and for us to send the swabs to St George’s for testing. This means our staff don’t have to travel to Chessington and also means the facility has more capacity for other parts of the health and care system.” Normally  government contracts over a certain value are advertised publicly and awarded after a competitive tender. However  it is understood that the health department appointed Deloitte without competition  under an obscure piece of legislation introduced in 2015 which ministries have been told they can use during the pandemic to avoid lengthy tendering processes. A Deloitte spokesman said: “Deloitte  alongside many other public and private sector partners  is supporting DHSC (the Department of Health and Social Care) to help accelerate and scale testing capacity for the national Covid-19 testing programme.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b63d217b410530e61e1a0e8d8f6d954e50ed1/5_0_5245_3148/master/5245.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0d7844eedde49909c3d926d4e6232ce https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHospitals%2CNHS%2CDeloitte%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPrivatisation%2CConservative+leadership%2CHealth%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/jaguar-land-rover-and-aston-martin-among-uk-firms-planning-return,world, Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin among UK firms planning return, Carmakers announce new safety measures  as B&Q reopens sites and Taylor Wimpey plans to resume work, Carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin joined Taylor Wimpey in announcing they would restart work with social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The DIY retailer B&Q opened 80 sites on Thursday  taking its total this week to 155 as it rolled back the blanket closure of its estate last month. Vast numbers of companies across the UK have stopped operations during the pandemic  but with no end in sight for physical distancing rules  companies have been forced to consider new ways of working. Jaguar Land Rover  the UK’s biggest carmaker  plans to gradually reopen some factories on 18 May. The company’s Solihull plant  which employs 9 000 workers making its Range Rover models  will reopen with a quarter of its workers at first  alongside SUV plants in Slovakia and Austria. This month Vauxhall said it was ready to reopen its Ellesmere Port site on the Wirral after setting out socially distanced production lines  break areas and restrooms. “We are developing robust protocol and guidelines to support a safe return to work ” said JLR. “We will adopt strict social distancing measures across our business and are currently evaluating a number of different measures to ensure we protect and reassure our workforce when they begin to return to work.” Aston Martin Lagonda said it would reopen its factory in St Athan  south Wales  on 5 May with new safety measures similar to those planned by Vauxhall. The carmaker hopes to ramp up production of its new sports utility vehicle  the DBX. The new car is crucial to reviving the fortunes of the company  recently bailed out by a consortium led by a billionaire investor. Its chief executive  Andy Palmer  and board members also said they would take a voluntary 35% pay cut. The pay of other executives at the company will fall by 20%  in line with the reduction for workers furloughed under the government’s job retention scheme. B&Q has gradually reopened just over half its stores this week and could open more next week after introducing a number of safety measures. The DIY chain is classed as an essential retailer under the government’s high street lockdown rules but nevertheless closed stores last month. However  it has now reopened 155 outlets  following the example of supermarkets by limiting the number of customers in stores at any one time  switching to card-only payments and installing perspex screens at checkouts to shield staff. “Having watched other essential retailers support social distancing in their stores  we are now following their best practice and are re-opening some stores with strict social distancing measures in place ” said a B&Q spokesperson. Supermarkets  deemed essential retailers by the government  have stayed open with measures including 2-metre markers on shop floors and protective screens for checkout staff. Taylor Wimpey and Vistry  formerly known as Bovis  also announced plans on Thursday to start building again. Vistry said it would resume building homes on Monday  while the first Taylor Wimpey workers will return on 4 May. While Taylor Wimpey has drawn up a Covid-19 code of conduct to which all staff  subcontractors and suppliers have to sign up  many construction workers have taken to social media to complain of unsafe working conditions. They say the 2-metre physical distancing rule is almost impossible to adhere to on building sites and in work canteens. To try to allay these concerns  Taylor Wimpey said it had designed and started manufacturing a bespoke face shield  which will attach to a construction hard hat and will be used on all its sites for two-person tasks. Pete Redfern  Taylor Wimpey’s chief executive  said: “We are now confident that we have clear plans and processes in place so we can safely start back on site in a phased way beginning on 4 May.” The construction firm Mace started reopening some of its 90 sites in early April after a two-week shutdown  and the French firm Bouygues said earlier this week that it would restart construction in the UK “progressively”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216d9bfcde58d194eaa76694b5965768c40e54d6/0_160_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69b27d7e00ea47ca7dd5129361fccf77 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CManufacturing+sector%2CJaguar+Land+Rover%2CAston+Martin%2CTaylor+Wimpey%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial,world, First trial for potential Covid-19 drug shows it has no effect, WHO draft put online states remdesivir does not benefit severe coronavirus patientsCoronavirus latest: at a glance, The drug is in short supply globally because of the excitement it has generated. It is one of the drugs Donald Trump claimed was “promising”. In a “gold standard” trial of 237 patients  some of whom received remdesivir while others did not  the drug did not work. News of the failure was posted on a World Health Organization clinical trials database  but later removed. A WHO spokesman said it had been uploaded too soon by accident. “A draft document was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments ” said Tarik Jasarevic  a WHO spokesperson. The drug  made by the US company Gilead Sciences  is an antiviral that was trialled in Ebola  but which failed to show benefits in Africa. In the race for drugs that might work against Covid-19  many doctors have given remdesivir to patients on “compassionate grounds” without waiting for trials. Because of the interest in it  the world’s biggest trial of possible treatments for Covid-19 at Oxford has not been able to include it  because researchers could not obtain supplies. The trial of the drug in China  on patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms  may give some doctors pause. Gilead  however  claimed there were still signs that it could be useful  possibly in patients with milder versions of disease. In the trial  158 patients were randomly assigned to be given remdesivir  while 79 others had standard care with a placebo instead. There was no difference between the groups with respect to recovery time. Just under 14% of those on remdesivir died  compared with nearly 13% of those not taking the treatment. “In this study of hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19  [which] was terminated prematurely  remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits ” said the report on the WHO website. The report added: “Remdesivir was stopped early in 18 (11.6%) patients because of adverse effects  compared with 4 (5.1%) in the control group.” There were no details in the short report of the side effects. Just a week ago  it emerged that researchers in Chicago were excited by the results of a Gilead-run trial of remdesivir in 125 patients. Nearly all those people were discharged within a week  according to STAT News  which follows the pharmaceutical industry. However  there was no placebo group  which meant researchers could not be sure that it was the drug that made the difference  and not something else. Remdesivir is one of a handful of drugs that have been enthusiastically backed by doctors and politicians as potential cures for Covid-19. There has also been a rush to give patients hydroxychloroquine  a less toxic version of the antimalarial chloroquine. That has led to shortages for people who need to take it for lupus  a disease that affects the immune system. Scientists who want to see proper trials conducted are likely to point to the remdesivir trial failure as strong evidence of the dangers of giving out even tested drugs on compassionate grounds for a disease that is so novel. • This article was amended on 30 April 2020. An earlier version said that the remdesivir trial had been stopped early because of side-effects. Although some patients were taken off the drug because of side-effects  it was stopped early because they did not recruit enough patients. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f351efc1ea1cbbaa746a4253198e9e0e5ed334b/0_61_2964_1779/master/2964.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6f29d69c1cc28b03e829f35361a0b2b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+Health+Organization%2CDrugs%2CMedical+research%2CInfectious+diseases%2CScience%2CMicrobiology%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news%2CChina%2CHealth https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/23/britons-are-reading-more-in-lockdown-says-survey-for-world-book-night,books, Britons are reading more in lockdown  says survey for World Book Night, The Reading Agency  which runs the annual event going ahead on Thursday in curtailed form  says there has been a particular spike among younger readers, Marking the annual World Book Night on Thursday  the survey from the Reading Agency of more than 2 000 people in the UK found that 31% were reading more since lockdown began  with the charity noting a “particular spike”  of 45%  among young people aged between 18 and 24. “It takes me to another  better place and allows me to escape the current situation for a while ” one 67-year-old female respondent told the Reading Agency. Total physical book sales in the UK jumped 6% in the week before the national lockdown began  with sales monitor Nielsen BookScan noting a 35% week-on-week boost for paperback fiction. Adult non-fiction  however  was down by 13%  as readers sought solace in imaginary worlds. That same week  Waterstones  the UK’s biggest book chain  reported that its online sales were up by 400% week-on-week. The survey is also backed up by figures from libraries around Britain. Although branches are shut  there has been a boom in registrations  according to the Local Government Association  with Hampshire county council reporting a 770% increase in new digital users  Cornwall a 630% increase and Hertfordshire an increase of 332%. A curtailed version of World Book Night will kick off on Thursday night  as the annual giveaway of thousands of titles – which this year ranges from Raynor Winn’s memoir The Salt Path to Angie Thomas’s young adult novel On the Come Up – has been postponed. More than 50 000 books had been set to be distributed to prisons  hospitals  youth centres  care homes and mental health groups  but following government advice this will now take place later in the year. Instead  5 000 free audiobooks will be sent to members of the public for the first time. The Reading Agency  which runs World Book Night  is holding a Reading Hour from 7 to 8pm BST on Thursday  and inviting the country to spend the time reading with family  by themselves  or discussing books online using the hashtag #ReadingHour. One contributor will be the novelist Patrick Gale  who is reading Anne Enright’s “compelling and utterly convincing” Actress. “Lockdown is not making me read more – I still read in bed every night – but it seems to be making me pay closer attention ” said Gale. “I haven’t turned out all my cupboards during lockdown. I haven’t baked a single cake. I haven’t learnt a new language ” said children’s author Jacqueline Wilson. “But I’ve read a great deal  and very randomly. I’ve read two Dickens  The Secret Garden  a new Anne Tyler and an old favourite  an Adam Mars Jones  Cecil Beaton’s Bright Young Things  and a brilliant new biography of the Beatles.” “I would have thought I’d be in need of comfort reading  but instead I’m looking for answers in books in a way I haven’t for years ” said author Sadie Jones  who is reading Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet  which was shortlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction this week. Jones called it “a wonderful book in many ways  not least the fresh  vital evocation of 16th century  a time just like ours  when the tiniest microbe could end a beloved human life  and change the course of millions”. World Book Night  which was set up to inspire people to read more  is also asking readers to recommend or send a book to a friend. “This year’s World Book Night celebrations provide the perfect opportunity to showcase the proven power of reading to connect people. Never has this connectivity been needed more than at this anxious time of social distancing ” said the Reading Agency’s Debbie Hicks. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6c1edef1ba291ef667290b8b792b7d7a0e15a0/0_333_4236_2543/master/4236.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b80caa75f517bd36258e2d0dbbe15d6b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=World+Book+Night%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CLibraries https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/24/at-the-drive-in-eno-to-stage-coronavirus-lockdown-friendly-opera,music, At the drive-in: ENO to stage opera at a safe physical distance, Live performances planned at Alexandra Palace for audience in cars (or on bicycles), Planned for the first three weeks of September  the idea is to stage live performances in the grounds of Alexandra Palace  north London  with musicians and singers spaced out to conform with physical distancing guidelines. If successful  ENO hopes to roll out the “Drive & Live” concept to other parts of the UK. Stuart Murphy  ENO’s chief executive  told the Guardian it was part of the company’s mission of “opera for everyone”. He said: “It is a bit of an experiment and if it works it might be a way of bringing the artform to people in a totally different and authentic way.” Murphy said the company had been thinking about the concept before the coronavirus outbreak  but had accelerated the plans. People are desperate for communal experiences  he said. “The odd thing for all of us is the lack of social contact at the moment. If I see one more Zoom thing of 50 musicians singing … I now find it cold. “I miss seeing my brother and sister  seeing my mates close up  and I miss seeing something live. It is human nature to yearn for that. Hopefully we can offer that universal  collective experience in a safe environment.” The idea is that the audience would be in 300 cars  with the bigger vehicles at the back. People on motorbikes and pedal cycles would also be allowed. Then windows go down and the audience watches the live performance unfold on a specially constructed set. The audience reaction could be interesting  Murphy said. “Instead of clapping or shouting ‘bravo’  it might be that people flash their lights or honk their horn. As long as it’s authentic  we’re not going to force it. “I think it could attract a whole new generation to opera  people who love their car  see it as an extension to themselves  as well as reassuring an audience they can turn up totally safe.” Murphy said if the concept worked then he could see drive-in operas being staged at racecourses or historic properties. “We’ve also had a couple of really productive conversations with international opera houses who think we’re on to something. It is an attempt to square the circle and let people have a big collective moment while staying safe.” The first 12 performances will be a shortened 90-minute version of Puccini’s La Bohème and a one-hour family-friendly version of Mozart’s The Magic Flute. The first show will be free for NHS and frontline workers. The concept does  of course  depend on lockdown driving restrictions being lifted. “We’re following all the developments ” said Murphy. “A report came out yesterday from the EU which said private transport use would be one of the first things lifted … so we feel as confident as anyone. But things change every day.” Murphy  who joined ENO in 2018 after a career in TV  including working as launch controller of BBC Three  said the company was still planning to open Hairspray at its London Coliseum home in September  and would soon announce details of its 2020-21 opera programme for the autumn and next spring. He said all arts companies needed now to be “nimble and quick” and react to circumstances  but at the moment ENO was not planning for seats being empty. “To be honest we’re trying to test the temperature every day.” Some countries have allowed drive-in cinemas to remain open during the lockdown. Germany  for example  has two year-round operations  in Essen and Cologne. According to the Hollywood Reporter  both have sold out for every screening since Germany’s lockdown was declared. Makeshift drive-ins are also popping up around the country. In the US  the spiritual home of the drive-in  fewer than 25 of the nation’s 320 drive-ins are reportedly open for business  but that could change. The New York governor  Andrew Cuomo  said last week he would consider allowing drive-ins to reopen. “Where is the public safety issue? It’s a drive-in theatre. You’re in the car with the same people ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cd7efe9aed20faed1df00ad5a3e795e2b025e50/0_10_4205_2524/master/4205.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7346da5f13787ad754576cb8aef79c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ead9d69198860e6441cb67df0a4d3456ed1d341d/0_3_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f3ed9dd67f8d25935c90d5e9c0d884ba https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=English+National+Opera+%28ENO%29%2COpera%2CLondon%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CCulture%2CUK+news%2CMusic%2CClassical+music https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/what-would-year-physical-distancing-mean-for-uk,world, Coronavirus: what would a year of physical distancing mean for the UK?, Some restrictions likely to be gradually eased but older people may be stuck at home, But what would a new normal of physical distancing look like? Construction and manufacturing are likely to be at the forefront of a phased return that would be based on a traffic-light system  particularly given the pressure from Conservative MPs. The government recently issued guidance saying such work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules “wherever possible”. Shops could return next  subject to reduced opening hours and strict rules on customer numbers at any one time    including DIY retailers and garden centres  plus hairdressers. In terms of non-essential services  they could be followed by restaurants and pub  though again with physical distancing on tables and a cap on customer numbers. Last to come back would be arts and culture  including cinemas and theatres  while Premier League football matches would initially be played behind closed doors  perhaps with some screened on free-to-air TV. The National Theatre is hoping to reopen in July while planning for scenarios that might push it back as late as January or beyond. The government said in March it would be contacting 1.5 million people to tell them they should be “shielding” on account of being at a higher risk due to factors such as their age or underlying health conditions. That number could grow. The increase would be driven by information provided by GPs tasked with finding out more about other patients. If such groups have to confine themselves to their homes for another year  or until a vaccine is ready  then enhancements are likely to be made to processes including the employment of an army of volunteers and online delivery systems. One approach that has been discussed by policymakers  and proposed by researchers such as those at Warwick University  involves a youth-first policy allowing for younger worker in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents to return to work first. While younger groups are not impervious to Covid-19  they are regarded as the most resilient. Such an approach has led some to joke there could even be a maximum drinking age in the bars that might open at the same time. By contrast  vulnerable and older people – specifically those aged above 70 – might have to remain in their homes for at least another year or until a vaccine is developed. While there is a case for reopening smaller schools first  one proposal is for secondary schools and above to open initially  as older students would be more likely – in theory – to abide by physical distancing and travel by themselves. In England the most likely are years 10 and 12 - the first years of GCSE and A-levels respectively. In terms of primaries  one idea floating around government is that year 6 – comprising 10- and 11-year-olds – could be allowed back. Other proposed measures include staggering opening times  capping numbers and hours  altering term times and providing protective equipment for staff in some instances. Britons have not been ordered to wear masks in public  although this could become more commonplace if mayors including London’s Sadiq Khan continue to back the measure. But it appears other measures  including floor markings inside and outside supermarkets  are here to stay and may well be expanded. Temperature screening  of the type that customers in China’s shops and travellers at some international airports have become used to  could also appear. A concept that could gain traction again is that of immunity passports for people who have antibodies after previously contracting coronavirus. But this is complicated  not least by problems with testing  unsettled science around immunity and fears some may want to become deliberately infected. Amid an unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance  many might also be concerned by steps towards tracking of the type credited in South Korea with helping to suppress the pandemic there at an early stage. An NHS app is being tested that would allow people to report their symptoms and then anonymously alert other users that have been in contact with that person in recent days. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSchools%2CBusiness%2CEducation%2CSociety%2CRetail+industry https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/tories-urge-government-to-reveal-details-on-easing-uk-lockdown-coronavirus,world, Senior Tories urge government to reveal plans on easing UK lockdown, More transparency ‘desperately needed’ by businesses and the public, Influential Conservatives  including former ministers  have said No 10 needs to be more transparent with the public and businesses on potential exit strategies and must deliver a statement on the issue soon. Nicola Sturgeon used her daily press conference on Thursday to explain how Scotland might lift restrictions on some businesses and allow pupils to return to school. Northern Ireland’s first minister  Arlene Foster  has also suggested she could lift restrictions before England. Iain Duncan Smith  the former leader of the Conservative party  told the Guardian on Thursday: “The UK government now needs to recognise that the time is now. They need to bite the bullet and do it.” The government has so far said it does not want to give details of how the country might come out of the lockdown because it might lead to people no longer obeying the rules. Duncan Smith said: “My concern is that people are already beginning to do that. I’ve already noticed shops opening. I think they need to explain that we are not ready to come out yet but when we are  this is what’s going to happen.” He said Matt Hancock  the health secretary  was wrong to think that the government would lose control of restrictions by giving the public more information. Talks were going on within government privately on the way out of a lockdown  he suggested  and it was essential this was conveyed to the public as soon as possible. Theresa Villiers  the former environment secretary  said government advisers now needed to come forward with more details of what they perceived to be the exit route. She said: “We need a roadmap for a release from lockdown. I’m of course not saying that we should dispense with the advice of scientists and medics  but I think that ministers need to be more transparent now about how we will get to the point where the lockdown can be lifted because we need to give that hope to businesses who have been severely impacted by the crisis. “There is a case for a more transparent approach on all of this. I think the time has come where we need a clear signal about how and when we are going to return to a degree of normality.” Charles Walker  the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs  said the government had not got its strategy wrong yet but “it’s got more to do to get it right”. Most prescient was bringing business leaders into the debate  he said. “It’s time to make them part of the conversation. Now is the time. That doesn’t mean ending lockdown tomorrow  but businesses need reassurance. The economy is lives – it’s not mutually exclusive.” The justice select committee chair  Bob Neill  said Boris Johnson should deliver the message himself when he has recovered from the coronavirus. He said while he remained concerned about a second wave of infection should restrictions be lifted  it was an appropriate time to have the discussion. “There comes a limit to people’s tolerance. People will go along with things if they know where we are. Ultimately scientists and medics are there to advise  but these are policy decisions so ultimately that means politicians are accountable and have to take that decision on board. Hopefully Boris Johnson will be back in the harness by then.” Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  a backbencher  told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed garden centres and DIY stores could be reopened with physical distancing measures. He said he accepted that opening up the country again could risk infection but businesses desperately needed support or could cease trading. “I think on behalf of the businesses of this country  begin to give them a little bit of hope as to when we might be able to get back to normality.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b49a18be7cd5774242c0c47cdf6ef30fc583219/1253_40_1158_695/master/1158.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e4b95a8f8e8bf239aa4b97f544b3313 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CConservatives%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science,world, Scientists criticise UK government's 'following the science' claim, Ministers accused of abdicating political duty to narrow field of opaque expertise on Covid-19, They also raised concerns that the views of public health experts were being overlooked  with disproportionate weight given to the views of modellers. “As a scientist  I hope I never again hear the phrase ‘based on the best science and evidence’ spoken by a politician ” Prof Devi Sridhar  chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh  told the Guardian. “This phrase has become basically meaningless and used to explain anything and everything.” The government has repeatedly said it is being “led by the science” on decisions ranging from banning mass gatherings to closing schools  the use of face masks and  most recently  the prospects of lifting the lockdown. However  Sridhar and others argued that scientific views on these topics could be wide-ranging and dependent on a scientist’s field of expertise. The diversity of scientific views was apparent in March when case numbers were rising rapidly but the government chose not to ban mass gatherings or introduce wide-reaching physical distancing. “World Health Organization advice  and what we’ve learned from lots of previous outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries  is that the faster you move at the start  the better  because it’s exponential growth ” Sridhar said. “In public health  a test  trace and isolate campaign would’ve been where your mind first went.” Instead  she said  the government appeared to be basing policy on the presumption of a binary choice between two scenarios  played out in computer models  of either eradicating the virus or it becoming endemic. Prof Mark Woolhouse  an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh  said modelling had had a disproportionate influence. “I do think scientific advice is driven far too much by epidemiology – and I’m an epidemiologist. “What we’re not talking about in the same formal  quantitative way are the economic costs  the social costs  the psychological costs of being under lockdown ” he said. “I understand that the government is being advised by economists  psychiatrists and others  but we’re not seeing what that science is telling them. I find that very puzzling.” Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority  the idea of doing this at any cost was naive. “With any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What’s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.” Others expressed concern about the lack of transparency around the evidence affecting decision-making. “We don’t know who sits on Sage [the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies]  we see very little of the papers that go to Sage ” said Prof Sheila Bird  the former programme leader of the Medical Research Council’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge. “That scientific underpinning is not evident.” Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages  which may have diverted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment  she said. The concept of shielding the most vulnerable “looks beautiful” in models  she said  but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. “You can’t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph ” she said. “There’s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background  the same field  the same institutions; that can lead to blindspots and groupthink ” Sridhar added. “Diversity is clearly important for better decision-making.” Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise. “The government isn’t using expertise simply to validate claims  it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy ” Prof Christina Boswell  a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh  wrote this week. “If things go wrong – and the curve gets too steep – it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.” Prof Chris Whitty: the truthteller Chief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind  often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty  however  has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him – or even a step behind. On Wednesday  Whitty  a practising NHS consultant physician  told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year. Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naif Vallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George’s  University of London  researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology  and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018  he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline  where  unusually for the industry  he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies. He left to become the government’s chief scientific adviser  but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government’s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity  saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak  not suppress it completely. “Also  because the vast majority of people get a mild illness  to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.” Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal; it was simply an outcome. Neil Ferguson: the workaholic Ferguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis  which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College. He has a long history in modelling epidemics  originally with Roy Anderson’s unit at Oxford University  where they worked on BSE  vCJD  foot and mouth  Sars and swine flu – sometimes attracting controversy. Ferguson is a mathematician  an epidemiologist and a workaholic who  before the lockdown  moved seamlessly between Downing Street  university and press briefings. Even while recovering from Covid-19 himself  he gave evidence to MPs and did interviews. His team’s work is at the heart of the lockdown strategy  predicting the numbers of deaths it will save. Dr Jenny Harries: the ‘national treasure’ The deputy chief medical officer has been called a “national treasure” by Vogue  which may reflect the fact she is a rarity – a woman on the Downing Street briefings podium. With degrees in pharmacology and medicine  she joined Public Health England in 2013. Like her boss  Whitty  she is independent-minded  and she warned at the end of March that the lockdown could last for six months or longer. She also suggested couples living separately could “test the strength of their relationship” during the lockdown by moving in together. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam: the flu expert Jonathan Stafford Nguyen Van-Tam is a widely published expert on influenza and the vaccines and antiviral drugs used to treat it. Now one of the government’s two deputy chief medical officers  he is regularly deferred to by Hancock. He spent four years in the pharmaceutical industry before returning to the public sector to head the pandemic influenza office of the Health Protection Agency  which is now part of Public Health England  and was a member of Sage during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic. His grandfather Nguy?n v?n Tâm was the prime minister of Vietnam in 1952. Prof Stephen Powis: the NHS’s defender A kidney specialist  Powis is a professor of renal medicine at UCL and was the medical director of the Royal Free hospital until 2018. Now the medical director of NHS England  his job is to defend it against the threat of Covid-19. As such  his comments at Downing Street briefings have not always stuck to the medical need. With Michael Gove on 4 April  he criticised people sabotaging 5G phone masts under the illusion they were implicated in the spread of the virus. “I’m absolutely outraged  absolutely disgusted  that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c0e97028a48c1df6675eb1e95caabe2eb713b1/79_275_3013_1808/master/3013.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=004be38df8c5e3ab218201cd11b78702 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/952914849a306d5757dbb8d1e5a70d3df48b7bc5/81_1_970_582/master/970.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de8a7a71577d7a97fca1cd32ae1c1733 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74639fa4dbcd8db4ddf90c1095ecd1d59f8b4b51/1166_158_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d6835300e347859cbe271dd49306297 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5777c380cd8d31a70d84df8db1cf8f8c544ddab3/267_136_1987_1191/master/1987.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6805406e438bd7151b3ae70f32f91705 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d8596cdc5261ea2708b30d3416f8ccc8f67e59/0_28_3138_1883/master/3138.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ee73c2be319f470c72754e5e76d7cf1 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CScience https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/why-the-uk-is-finding-it-so-hard-to-reach-100000-covid-19-tests-a-day,world, Why the UK is finding it so hard to reach 100 000 Covid-19 tests a day, A slow start  a top-down approach and long-term cuts to local services meant target was always going to be ambitious, “I’m now setting the goal of 100 000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I’m determined we’ll get there ” said the health secretary  who had tested positive around a week earlier. It amazed many observers  but it wasn’t the most ambitious testing target the government had put forward. On 25 March  under pressure on testing and claiming the UK was doing better than other countries  the prime minister said: “We are going up from 5 000 to 10 000 tests per day  to 25 000  hopefully very soon up to 250 000 per day.” But even the lower numbers have never stacked up. With less than a week to go until his self-imposed deadline  and in spite of buoyant talk by ministers and advisers  many believe that the 100 000 target to which Hancock so firmly committed himself will also be missed. A massive effort to set up big new laboratories and engage smaller ones  the “little ships”  to help  along with a plan for 50 drive-through centres  has increased capacity. But with a week to go  the UK finds itself with capacity for 40 000 tests a day – and only half that number being carried out. It is well short of the pledge and  more importantly  if the intention is for the UK to test its way out of lockdown  it is not enough. If the target is missed  there is a risk that blame may be deflected on to the tens of thousands of health workers and key workers themselves. Hancock has already said that they are not turning up at the drive-through centres in the numbers expected. But in fact nurses and doctors have ended up self-isolating because of the long distances they would have to drive to get tested – and there have been stories of some being turned away when they get there. And as strategists and politicians start to map out the exit from lockdown  the question of resources for local public health teams that have been stripped back over a decade of austerity will become increasingly urgent. The regular – perhaps weekly – testing of those on the frontline and tracking down contacts has to be done locally. It cannot be run  as so much of the epidemic response has been  from Westminster. But to understand how that pledge has begun to seem so out of reach  it is essential to look at how the government’s approach to it began: slowly. The UK started ramping up testing too late  having abandoned it as a core principle on 12 March  when Johnson declared the virus could no longer be contained. People with symptoms should just stay at home  he said. Only hospital patients would be tested. Thus Britain went to the back of the queue for testing kits  reagents and other commodities that the world was scrambling for. Testing  followed by contact tracing and quarantine  is the standard public health response to an infectious disease epidemic  supported loudly by the World Health Organization  whose director general said it should be “the backbone of the response in every country”. The UK had other ideas  but as the numbers admitted to hospital rose and NHS staff began to stay at home because they or their family fell ill  the calls for testing became more vocal. Promises began to be made. In an odd disconnect  NHS and Public Health England had said they intended to reach 10 000 tests a day on 11 March  the day before Johnson declared the containment phase over and said people with symptoms should stay home untested. Just 1 215 people had been tested by that stage. The issue got hotter. On 18 March  Johnson declared the UK would do 25 000 tests a day  but did not say when. On 29 March  Hancock tweeted that they had reached the 10 000 target and were on course for 25 000. The watchdog organisation Full Fact  however  later said the data did not support the claim. The highest number tested in a day in England at that time had been 9 114. On 2 April  Hancock made the pledge that threatens to “come back and bite him”  according to the Telegraph this week  citing “a No 10 insider”. They would do 25 000 tests a day by mid- to late April  and 100 000 tests a day by the end of the month. With the prime minister in isolation in Downing Street with symptoms  and a need to quash difficult questions about why the UK lagged behind  the health secretary made some admissions. Unlike Germany  the UK did not have a huge diagnostics industry  he said  so had been “catching up”. He acknowledged that global demand had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed but “we are still tackling the reagents issue  which is a global challenge”  he said. In a rare moment  he admitted that the government had not got everything right: “There will be criticisms made  and some of them will be justified.” But he also had a reassuringly substantial-sounding plan for what was next  from bringing in commercial partners to scaling up Britain’s diagnostic capacity: the “five pillars”. However many pillars there were  100 000 tests a day was such a big number that it was assumed the government was including antibody tests to demonstrate people had been infected in the past  as well as the PCR swab tests for people with symptoms. The government had been enthusiastic about the possibility of a fingerprick antibody test that anyone could do at home  like a pregnancy test. Johnson on 19 March said: “To give you an idea of what is coming down the track  we’re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test  as simple as a pregnancy test  which can tell whether you have had the disease. It’s early days  but if it works as its proponents claim  then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game-changer.” Public Health England’s director of infections  Prof Sharon Peacock  elaborated on 25 March  telling the science and technology committee of MPs that a simple home test would be available within days. But it wasn’t to be. Oxford University scientists have been evaluating some of the 3.5m antibody tests Hancock bought from a number of companies. He had placed orders for a further 17.5m. The best of them are 70% accurate. Most are only right half the time. Having previously claimed that it had struck deals which meant no payment would be made until the tests were proven  the government is now trying to get its money back. So the 100 000 tests are PCR swab tests for current viral infection only  and all the stops have been pulled out to get there. On Wednesday  the Department for Health and Social Care hailed the “biggest network of diagnostic labs in British history”  built in five weeks flat. Three mega-labs would process samples from 27 of the planned 50 drive-through centres. Dozens of universities  research institutes and companies were lending equipment. The UK’s two biggest drug companies  Astra Zeneca and GlaxoSmithKline  are collaborating on a fourth lab in Cambridge. And yet  only half the daily 40 000 test capacity is being used. Hancock talked of lower than expected demand and has opened the scheme to other key workers outside the NHS  including social care workers  police  prison officers  social workers and benefits staff. But there is a fundamental problem. Key workers don’t want a long drive at the end of a gruelling shift to get tested. “What I’m hearing from the frontline is that nurses are driving up to two hours  feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus  to testing stations  and sometimes if you haven’t got an appointment you’re turned away and told to come back another time ” Dame Donna Kinnair  general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing  told the health and social care select committee. The British Medical association estimated on Wednesday that nearly 100 000 health workers were self-isolating because the testing sites were not easy to get to. Prof John Ashton  former regional director of public health for north-west England  said the government’s battle plan against Covid-19 had been so centralised and top-down that they hadn’t asked people what would work for them in their locality. “You have to go to them. They should be testing them as they leave work ” he said. “It’s the same issue with immunisation.” Offering nurses flu jabs in the hospital as they arrive or go home has successfully raised rates in the past. Importantly  testing is not an end in itself. When the UK attempts to lift the lockdown  testing  tracing the contacts of anyone who is positive and ensuring they isolate themselves is essential. Key workers running higher risks may have to be tested weekly. That needs to be run locally  by people who understand the community they live and work in. But regional public health teams have been decimated. Local authorities were given responsibility for public health in the Andrew Lansley reforms. Cash-strapped town halls have raided the public health budgets  which are down by at least 30%. Public health teams “are a shadow of what they were”  said Ashton. In the 1970s  Liverpool had 6 000 public health staff  including community nurses  health visitors  food hygiene staff and many others. “Now they’d be lucky to have 30 or 40 staff ” he said. “Bolton has got four in its public health team.” The epidemic will not behave in the same way in every part of Britain. Once out of UK-wide lockdown  cases will flare in one region or another  and the best firefighters will be local public health teams. These are people who know their communities. It is the local teams  says Ashton  who could have made the next chapter less disastrous than the current one. “They are the ones that should be leading on contact tracing and testing programmes ” he said. “This can’t be done from Whitehall.” The problem is  in many cases  they barely exist. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5453f5d5b00e1ccd5a0b0906ff914971429827e8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ae5ed72739115463b6f841a8be10588 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3fdcdd234514357c1d5617b6494c31de6a21c3/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ffb12f2ba9895a68bf615282dc484a0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CLocal+government%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CHospitals https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sick-care-home-residents-not-tested-despite-uk-government-pledge,world, Sick care home residents not tested despite UK government pledge, Leaked email reveals delay 10 days after Matt Hancock said any resident with symptoms would be checked for coronavirus, With a worsening crisis in care homes for the elderly  where thousands have died  the health secretary pledged on 14 April that all residents would be able to get a test  not just an initial five people in an outbreak at each home. He claimed again on Thursday that “anybody in a care home who has symptoms now gets tested”. However  a leaked email from Public Health England (PHE) to a care provider said on Wednesday that “the processes to undertake this have still not been established”. Asked why it could not test more care home residents  PHE initially said its policy was still only to test residents in an initial outbreak  despite the position of Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) being that all symptomatic residents should be tested. A PHE spokesman said: “If there is a brand new outbreak and a care home needs to establish if there is an outbreak  they contact their local public health team and the local health protection team will arrange testing and do a risk assessment for that care home. That is done at PHE labs or one of our partner labs in the NHS. “If after there is an established outbreak they suspect there are more individuals who are symptomatic and may need testing  from a public health point of view  because we have already given advice on what to do  the public health advice doesn’t really change. “So it isn’t really beneficial from a PHE point of view. So PHE wouldn’t then further test any people in that care home. But the DHSC is rolling out greater testing  so that’s when they get involved.” However following that explanation  a PHE spokesperson later issued a statement saying all sick residents and staff will get tested as soon as possible: “PHE would like to apologise if our letter has caused confusion to the care home. All residents and staff will be tested and we will arrange this straight away.” PHE’s earlier stance meant that care homes are having to rely on the DHSC’s commercial testing capacity at 28 drive-through sites across the UK  which are not appropriate for most care home residents to access. There are also four mobile testing units for England and a small number of home testing kits being piloted  although Prof John Newton  who is coordinating testing efforts  said this would be scaled up to 50 in the coming week. Peter Kyle  the Labour MP who obtained the leaked email  said a care home in his East Sussex constituency was refused tests for further residents beyond an initial outbreak of a handful of people. “The outbreak in this care home has suddenly worsened with another five symptomatic patients who cannot be tested ” he said. “There are staff who are sick and staff who are refusing to come to work. “A month ago  the prime minister promised that testing would be rolled out into care homes and personal protective equipment (PPE) would be there by the end of that week. Thousands of people have died since then. “I’m convinced the loss of life in care homes could have been limited. They could have tested  got the right PPE  and stopped workers working between multiple homes. They put the NHS on battle stations but they left social care as business as usual … It has been criminal neglect.” Care home providers have pleaded for more testing and warned that the pandemic is still spreading in their sites  after official figures showed more than 1 000 people were confirmed to to have died in care homes from the virus in the week to April 10. Prof Martin Green  the chief executive of industry group Care England  said on Tuesday that the number of fatalities in care “could easily exceed what’s [happening] in hospitals”  where 17 337 people have already died. He has estimated that at least 7 500 people have died of Covid-19 in care homes. A source at a major care home provider confirmed there are still widespread problems with residents getting tests but it had been promised by the government that this would be resolved. A week ago  the government said 10 000 care home residents had been tested. That figure did not appear to have grown by Wednesday  when Helen Whately  the care minister  gave the same figure of 10 000 for how many care home residents had been tested. Liz Kendall  the shadow care minister  said the problem extended beyond the issue of care home residents being tested to difficulties getting care staff tested as well. “I’ve been sent reports of carers being asked to go from Norfolk to Sheffield  from Peterborough to Stansted  from Oxford to Twickenham and from Leicester to Beeston. And they are booked on to it by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) the next day – what good is that when they have families and may not have a car? “Matt Hancock was very clear in the social care action plan that all residents should be tested if they have symptoms. It’s one thing testing the carers that the CQC is doing. My understanding was PHE was doing the testing of residents. It’s a good question for the secretary of state.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0291361424d3e8ddd0be81c1f19588aa6678279c/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=806e46b7598398ecbadaa25a11c9833d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSocial+care%2CMatt+Hancock%2CSociety%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-testing-to-be-offered-to-england-key-workers-and-families,world, Coronavirus tests to be offered to key workers and families in England, Millions of workers and relatives will be able to book appointment online from Friday, The system  unveiled at Downing Street’s daily press conference  involves a dramatic expansion of the people who can be tested for the virus  as the government continues to try to reach its target of 100 000 daily tests by the end of April. The government estimates that there are 10 million key workers in the UK who will be eligible for the swab test  which has previously been available only to health workers. The tests will also be offered to the families of key workers  and it is expected that the devolved administrations will follow suit. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  said: “We can make it easier  faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test. “Any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves directly. This applies for people in essential workers’ households too  who need a test. It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.” The main focus for tests  available from Friday  will be the antigen variety  which tells people whether they currently have the illness. Antigen swab testing can show medics what treatment a patient should receive and who should isolate and who is able to return to work. An antibody blood test showing whether someone has had the illness in the past  which some have argued is more useful  will be used by the government in its forthcoming survey of the disease. The government has so far been under fire for setting an ambitious target of 100 000 tests a day by the end of the month  while drive-through testing facilities have been shown to be underused and difficult for care workers to access if they do not own a car. Capacity currently stands at 51 000 tests a day. In the last 24 hours  23 560 tests were carried out on 14 629 people. Professor John Newton  director of health improvement at Public Health England  who is coordinating testing  told the press conference that the government was on track to meet its 100 000 target. Contact tracing will be rolled out on a “large scale” with a new NHS app  Hancock said. If you are unwell  you can inform the app  which can let other people with it downloaded know that they have recently been in contact with someone with suspected coronavirus. To “kickstart” tracing  the government will hire 18 000 people  including 3 000 clinicians and public health experts  who will be trained over the coming weeks. The range of jobs classed as essential is extensive  and includes teachers and support staff  people in the justice system  charities  workers delivering key frontline services  transport workers and those working for local government. The process is free and results will be sent out by text  with a helpdesk set up to deal with queries. The shadow health secretary  Jonathan Ashworth  said Labour had consistently asked for a testing and tracing strategy. He said: “It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers such as care staff are now able to access testing. “We will continue to hold the government to account for the promise it has made of 100 000 tests a day by the end of the month.” Teaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will be able to access coronavirus testing  with some calling it an essential precondition before schools are reopened. Paul Whiteman  general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers  said: “School staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety. “If testing can be delivered effectively  then it will be welcomed by the education sector.” Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested  and that so far the government had been slow to respond. The number of drive-through test centres will increase from 30 to 48 and the army will run 48 mobile testing units  which will be used to target care homes. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/23/scots-must-accept-life-alongside-covid-19-as-new-normal-sturgeon-lockdown,uk-news, Scots must accept life alongside Covid-19 as new normal – Sturgeon, Scottish government planning for cycle of lockdowns being lifted and reimposed, Announcing daily data indicating a continuing drop in hospital admissions and intensive care cases  Sturgeon on Thursday urged the Scottish public to read and respond to the 26-page document  which stresses that Scotland may break with the current “four nations approach” if expert advice recommends this. Within five hours of being posted online  the PDF of the document had been accessed 170 000 times  the Scottish government later confirmed. The document places testing  tracing and isolation at the heart of the continuing strategy  and emphasises the need for innovative approaches to continued physical distancing as well as “unprecedented” public compliance. It states: “If  after easing any restrictions  the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus  then we will have to reimpose them  possibly returning to lockdown with little notice. While we will do our best to avoid this  it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.” Sturgeon said the lifting of the lockdown was not “a flick of a switch”  and physical distancing and limited contact with others was likely to continue “for the rest of the year and maybe beyond”. She said group gatherings  for example in pubs or at public events  were likely to be banned or restricted for some months to come  and some form of shielding would be required for the foreseeable future as well as “stronger surveillance for those coming into the country”. The first minister also raised the prospect of redesigning workplaces and schools to allow people to remain two metres apart  with the possibility of some groups of pupils returning before others or on different days of the week. Asked whether these long-term restrictions were likely to affect family Christmas celebrations  Sturgeon said: “I’m not cancelling Christmas. Christmas is still a quite a long way away – I know it comes round quicker every year. It may happen slightly differently depending on where we are  but we will take these things in a calm  considered way.” The document says the Scottish government will assess easing restrictions for specific geographies and sectors  for example parts of the rural economy. This would happen only if it did not undermine the “simplicity of the message”  Sturgeon said. It likewise drives home the importance of stabilising below 1.0 the virus’s reproduction number (R0)  which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates  and ensuring that the impact of any easing of restrictions did not raise the number above that figure. Sturgeon said when the lockdown began  Scotland’s R0 was above 3  while the best estimates suggested it was now between 0.6 to 1. She said the continuing uncertainty over the infection rate was part of the reason why she was not lifting restrictions immediately. Scotland’s interim chief medical officer  Dr Gregor Smith  also would not specify an exact figure he wanted to see the number stabilise at  saying that in principle it should be “as low as possible”. The document also raises the prospect of using digital tools to assist contact tracing  and while it does not directly refer to the controversial approach of “herd immunity”  it says there is no such thing as “acceptable loss”  adding: “We are clear that an assumption that there is a proportion or section of the population that it is safe or acceptable to allow to be infected forms no part of the Scottish government’s policy or approach.” While the document is clear that Scotland could take a different path from the rest of the UK if the science requires it  Sturgeon said: “Most of what I’m talking about today I want to do on a UK-wide basis as far as it makes sense  but I have a responsibility as first minster to use the powers I have in a way that is right for Scotland.” No 10 said there was no indication so far that the four nation approach was crumbling. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “As far as I’m aware  the Scottish government have stressed they want to continue to operate within the four nations UK framework and align any decisions which are taken as far as possible. That is obviously the approach of ourselves.” The Scottish Conservative leader  Jackson Carlaw  said any divergence from the four nations strategy on ending the lockdown would require compelling evidence  “in the interests of ensuring clear and consistent advice to the public”. In contrast  the Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie said he welcomed the “recognition that a one-size-fits-all exit strategy for the UK was inappropriate”  but he said far more detail was needed on plans for an effective testing  tracing and isolation strategy  “especially when Scotland is not using the testing capacity it currently has”. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Scottish+politics%2CScotland%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CNicola+Sturgeon%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/lockdown-may-be-lifted-earlier-in-northern-ireland-than-rest-of-uk,world, Lockdown may be lifted earlier in Northern Ireland than rest of UK, Arlene Foster makes statement as it emerges extra critical care capacity not expected to be needed, The death rate in Northern Ireland is half that of England  and the projected death toll from coronavirus in Northern Ireland was revised down this week to 1 500. Earlier modelling had suggested a worst-case scenario of 15 000 deaths. The health minster  Robin Swann  said on Thursday: “For the time being our latest data modelling indicates that further critical care capacity will not be required during the first wave of transmission in Northern Ireland.” A virologist at Queen’s University Belfast has put the lower than expected death toll down to Northern Ireland’s low population density compared with other parts of the UK. There have been 263 deaths in Northern Ireland to date  a rate of 14 deaths per 100 000 population  compared with England’s 30 deaths per 100 000  based on the latest daily figures on hospital deaths published by NHS England. The three smaller UK nations all recorded their first deaths later than England  which may mean the disease began circulating later  while less urbanisation in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland could also be a contributory factor. But Swann warned against complacency in any moves to ease the clampdown on social  business  travel and other activities over the next few weeks. Foster said lockdown measures would be eased when scientific and public health criteria were met and she would give no timetables or dates. Foster told Cool FM radio on Thursday that any lifting of the lockdown would have to be “set down and agreed” with both the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive and the government in London. “And because of that  you could well see different parts of the United Kingdom move in different time to other parts  because it will be criteria-led ” she said. “What do I mean by that? We will have to look at the amount of admissions to hospital  the admissions to intensive care units  the number of deaths we have  what it means for us in terms of the science.” Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer  Dr Michael McBride  said local health officials had recorded a flattening of the Covid-19 infection curve in the region. Dr Lindsay Broadbent  a virologist and research fellow at the Wellcome/Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine at Queen’s University of Belfast  said there were some grounds for optimism that aspects of the local lockdown could be lifted. “There may be regional differences to ending the lockdown across the UK and Ireland. This will have to be guided by the science ” she told the Guardian. Broadbent said Northern Ireland’s lower projected death toll from the coronavirus was “due to population density and hospital and ICU capacity  for example”. Another factor was that “stricter measures may have been in place longer than somewhere like London.” All of Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 17 March. Swann  appeared more sceptical about lifting restrictions compared with the first minister. He said it was too early for his department to confirm that the number of Covid-19 deaths had peaked in the region. “While there are grounds for hope that the outbreak can be brought under control  the outbreak has not reached a point where some of the measures can be relaxed ” he said. One of the most controversial measures of Northern Ireland’s lockdown has been the closure of all cemeteries. Members of the public unable to visit loved ones’ graves have complained that while cemetery gates are locked  large queues snake outside off-licences  which remain open. The Northern Ireland executive remains split over cemetery closures  with Sinn Féin in favour of keeping them closed while the Ulster Unionists have argued they could be reopened with strict distancing measures. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06619cc956babf6fa85e7f2c873ff62e39d9254/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d60ab3063952c946b4e16eb85000cb3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Northern+Ireland%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CArlene+Foster%2CPolitics%2CNorthern+Irish+politics%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/23/encouraging-signs-in-wales-but-lockdown-should-stay-says-nhs-chief,uk-news, Welsh first minister to set out plans for lifting country's lockdown, Mark Drakeford will announce proposals to ease restrictions as number of new cases stabilises, The Labour politician will announce on Friday a new framework for easing restrictions and seven questions that need to be addressed to help lead Wales out of the pandemic. England remains the only nation without proposals to ease restrictions after Scotland’s first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  published a report on Thursday and the first minister of Northern Ireland  Arlene Foster  suggested she could lift restrictions at a different pace to the rest of the UK. On Thursday the head of NHS Wales cautioned against any partial lifting of lockdown measures despite “encouraging signs” that the country’s coronavirus outbreak may have peaked. Dr Andrew Goodall said the number of new confirmed cases in Wales was stabilising and the daily number of deaths was in decline. Public Health Wales reported 17 new fatalities from coronavirus on Thursday  down from a peak of 38 on 13 April  bringing the total number of deaths in Wales to 641. The number of new cases fell to 234  taking the total to 8 358. In a televised briefing from Cardiff  Goodall said there had been a drop in the number of coronavirus patients in hospitals and intensive care units. More than half of Wales’s critical care beds and 47% of acute hospital beds were currently free  he said. “I think these are encouraging signs  now reinforced by a pattern that is stronger over recent days ” he said  adding that experts in Wales “probably didn’t expect to see” such a fall in confirmed cases and deaths at this stage of the pandemic. However  he cautioned against any early lifting of physical distancing measures and said it was wrong to “assume that everything can return to normal” when the lockdown is next reviewed in a fortnight. Goodall said: “We have some concerns that we could have a second or possibly even a third peak. Our actions at this stage are intended to make sure that we can keep things stable and improving  but we will need to continue working with the public at large.” Earlier  Wales’s chief medical officer  Dr Frank Atherton  said the lockdown measures introduced on 23 March were working. “In the current wave of transmission that we are in  we haven’t just flattened the curve  we’ve completely squashed the curve ” he said. “That’s been done by the lockdown – it means that our transmission within the community is much less and we’re already seeing some plateauing in the kind of figures we look at.” Dr Andrew Freedman  the head of Cardiff University’s school of medicine  said it was difficult to compare Wales’s experience of coronavirus with that of neighbouring countries due to differences in population size and spread. However  he said the spread of the disease in Wales may have fallen sooner because it had relatively few cases when the lockdown was introduced. There were 662 confirmed cases of coronavirus in a population of 3 million people when Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown on 23 March  compared with more than 11 000 cases in England  with a population of 56 million. With 641 deaths reported as of 5pm on 22 April  the Welsh death rate equates to 20.4 deaths per 100 000 people  which is around the same as Scotland’s (20.6 deaths per 100 000) and lower than England’s  where there were 30 deaths per 100 000 based on the latest NHS England release. In Northern Ireland  the figure of 263 deaths so far works out as 14 deaths per 100 000. The three smaller nations all recorded their first deaths later than England  which may mean the disease began circulating later  while less urbanisation in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland may also have been a contributory factor. “There were predictions that we would have a much higher peak and that our NHS and our [intensive care units] would be overwhelmed  and by and large that hasn’t been the case. The numbers have been a lot lower than some predictions ” said Freedman  who is also a consultant physician in infectious diseases at the University hospital of Wales. “The lockdown measures were brought in when [Wales] was relatively earlier in the epidemic  we had fewer cases. There were fewer infections  fewer transmissions going on compared to other big cities  where it had already taken off.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/192dc1b713e71cbdadb7fd7f20bd351e4dd2a5ed/0_230_3959_2376/master/3959.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=049b96b63831419902a9e9d3c81ac56a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Wales%2CWelsh+politics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CMark+Drakeford%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/24/how-outer-hebrides-scotland-perfectly-primed-tackle-coronavirus,uk-news, How Outer Hebrides were perfectly primed to tackle coronavirus, Residents of Western Isles  which have yet to record a Covid-19 death  have plenty experience of isolation, Unlike Scotland’s other island groups  such as Orkney and Shetland  the Western Isles have had remarkably few confirmed cases: so far  only six people out of a population of nearly 27 000 are known to have contracted coronavirus. Official data confirmed this week that for 13 days there had been no new cases in the Western Isles  an archipelago that stretches from Lewis and Harris through the Uists and Benbecula down to Barra and Mingulay at its southern tip. The remarkable figures suggest an early decision by Scottish ministers to begin restricting all non-essential ferry travel  alongside issuing urgent appeals for city dwellers to stay away from the highlands and islands  may have paid off. CalMac and NorthLink  the country’s main ferry operators  started preventing holidaymakers and non-residents from using their ferries from 19 March  the day before the UK and Scottish governments ordered the nationwide lockdown  and on 27 March they introduced an emergency timetable. Only essential workers and lorry drivers have been allowed to travel since then. On Easter Sunday this year  only 146 people used Hebridean ferries  compared with 12 000 people on Easter Sunday last year. CalMac’s traffic has fallen by 95%. Dr Alasdair Allan  the Scottish National party MSP for the Western Isles  Na h-Eileanan an Iar in Scottish Gaelic  cautioned that many more cases on the islands might have gone undetected  but said islanders were quick to embrace the lockdown. “People on the islands were instantly aware of how dangerous that was because they knew their health services couldn’t cope with that situation ” he said. “There was a high degree of compliance despite the fact that the effects economically are very precarious  for areas with a seasonal economy.” Orkney and Shetland have had a tougher experience: official data from National Records of Scotland (NRS) shows that Shetland has had six deaths since the outbreak began  a rate of 2.6 people per 10 000 population  and 52 confirmed infections. Orkney has recorded two deaths  a rate of 0.9 per 10 000  yet has only had six confirmed infections. Alongside the Western Isles  it was the last place in Scotland to record a new infection  on 8 April. NRS data suggests the lockdown has protected other parts of rural Scotland too. The Highland region has had 50 deaths  but at 1.6 per 10 000  and the death rate in Grampian  which includes the Cairngorms  Speyside and Aberdeen  is 1.5 per 10 000. By contrast  the rate in Greater Glasgow and Clyde  which has the country’s most deprived and closely packed populations  is at 4.4 per 10 000 and at 3.5 per 10 000 in Lanarkshire. The Western Isles figures were highlighted because of a mistake that briefly caused alarm on the islands. After a patient died in Stornoway’s hospital from suspected Covid-19  that was put on his death certificate. But a test sample came back negative from Glasgow and the NHS board has asked for the NRS to change its records to record zero coronavirus deaths in the Western Isles. Gordon Jamieson  chief executive of NHS Western Isles  said it planned to greatly increase testing with a new machine that is expected to become operational on Monday  allowing it to test for the virus more widely among key workers and in the community. “I can fight it much better that way ” he said. It has allocated 60 “surge” beds for Covid-19 cases and capacity for eight intensive care patients in Stornoway – capacity that has not yet been needed  according to Jamieson. Their testing in the community suggested that  so far  the virus had not yet established itself. “When you’re living in fairly remote island communities  you find that people come to terms and adjust very rapidly to anything that happens up here ” he said. “At the very beginning there was an immediate and very high level of compliance with social distancing and with staying at home. It has been clear and it has been consistent; people have been very disciplined  and supportive and cooperative.” Allan remained cautious  however. He hoped greater testing would confirm that the lockdown has worked. But he added: “I don’t think anybody here is complacent about the possibility that we may just be at an early stage here. We might just be one of the last places in Europe to be affected. I’m hoping with more testing in the few days  we will get a complete picture of that.” Shetland has had a similar response from its residents. Past experience with infectious diseases  such as the recent swine flu outbreak and tuberculosis many decades ago  meant many islanders had voluntarily locked down early on. Dr Susan Bowie  a GP In Hillswick  a village in the far north-west of mainland Shetland  said her community self-isolated as soon as they heard the virus had arrived  earlier than in other parts of Scotland. Hillswick is 43 miles (69km) along difficult roads from the islands’ only hospital  in Lerwick  increasing the sense of vulnerability. Preparing for bad weather is instinctive. “People have been amazing at self-isolating  and they went into self-isolation at least two weeks before the rest of the UK ” she said. Her neighbours “keep a lot of full freezers. We always have quite a lot in the larder.” • This article was amended on 24 April 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly gave the fatality rates in percentages for Greater Glasgow and Clyde (4.4%)  and Lanarkshire (3.5%). This has been corrected to 4.4 per 10 000 and 3.5 per 10 000 respectively. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0161bef9686534498c0e652decbad3b989f0fd/0_376_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e41950951ce4ac7ea28d4d5eac0e275c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9bfc79d6148c3c015c8592b82c19fe68ebd678/0_0_4504_2703/master/4504.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0dec7ca14e7a69aa62e37e909d8a20ad https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Scotland%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/toxic-air-over-london-falls-by-50-at-busiest-traffic-spots,environment, Toxic air over London falls by 50% at busiest traffic spots, Lower pollution levels must persist after lockdown says capital’s mayor  Sadiq Khan, Figures released by the London mayor  Sadiq Khan  show that anti-pollution measures introduced from 2017 had already led to a 35% drop across the capital of the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide  NO2 – rising to a 44% reduction inside central London’s ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ). In the last four weeks of lockdown there have been further big reductions  with NO2 falling by a further 27% across London  and by almost half at some of the worst pollution hotspots. Khan welcomed the decline in toxic air  but said that once the lockdown was over it was essential that the efforts to improve London’s toxic air continued. “This cleaner air should not just be temporary. So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover  our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.” Although the figures show a big reduction in NO2  particulate pollution  which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture  and which is very harmful to human health  remains a severe threat in London. Elizabeth Fonseca  an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe  said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people’s health. “Nitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down  but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks’ or months’ improvement of just one pollutant doesn’t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.” There is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution  through lung disease  heart attacks  asthma  effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels. Research published on Monday also found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy  Spain  France and Germany accounted for 78% of all reported Covid-19 deaths in those areas. Another study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. In the UK NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last 10 years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones – such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London – where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils delay the planned introduction of clean air zones. Many cities across Europe  and some in the UK  have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits  in terms of cleaner air and safer streets  that have come about amid the lockdown. Gary Fuller  an air pollution expert at King’s College London  welcomed Thursday’s figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled. He said: “Breathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners’ health for far too long … but even before the Covid lockdown  London’s air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better. “Nitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we’ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city’s air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.” Prof Stephen Holgate  an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians  said that although Covid-19 had wreaked havoc  the “dreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus”. He added: “We’re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted  and once it does I sincerely hope we’ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we’ve developed.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b15405a1265d31d546269b6ceb7a01e0c8a05ba/0_361_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9bedd6b59ab30ab9a6533f688bd96318 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e05e7bb4f68158199f30d7aae103d22143ff040/0_308_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=708ebc3ce4187761117c100e9698f195 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9aa43c97a1de9a14cda85cb7c25217ceddf9640/188_637_2628_1577/master/2628.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fdcc697ee922ceea44b88647e0d593a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4710472d2d974d01eb923f0c9a3adabf3f0822/0_0_7203_4322/master/7203.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b89d4c6350a9c9e8c1d9e559a2908247 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff6a7c58c4a4e7bb314dcaa325a2b50c14a87fd/597_829_3998_2399/master/3998.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e747acc1b4a0c51b2cd2c79f412ef35a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Air+pollution%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CPollution%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEnvironment%2CGreenhouse+gas+emissions%2CSadiq+Khan%2CTransport%2CRoad+transport https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/23/mps-call-for-covid-19-grants-to-help-students-in-difficulty,education, MPs call for grants to help students in difficulty, Cross-party campaign says some students have lost jobs and can’t rely on parents to pay bills, They are part of a cross-party campaign seeking to alert the chancellor to the students’ plight and calling on him to offer financial support to those who have lost jobs and are not entitled to claim universal credit. Layla Moran  the education spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats  who is leading the campaign  said students from low-income backgrounds  without parents to fall back on for financial support  were among the most economically vulnerable in society as a result of the crisis and were in need of government support. “They are not eligible for universal credit  and many who do work throughout their studies have fallen through the cracks in the government’s furlough scheme ” she said. “That’s why I  along with 13 other cross-party MPs with university constituencies  have written to the chancellor calling on him to introduce a maintenance grant to help poorer students through these tough and stressful times. We cannot allow the most vulnerable in our society to fall through the gaps.” The Covid-19 pandemic has caused huge disruption in universities  where teaching has moved online and student life has been brought to a standstill. Most students have travelled home to be with family while others remain stranded by the lockdown. Students from low-income backgrounds who work throughout their studies in low-wage  zero-hours jobs to top up maintenance loans have been hard hit. Most have lost their jobs as the pandemic has closed businesses  yet they continue to have to pay rent and bills. A survey of 250 university and college students who have been in care or are estranged from their family found they were most worried about being able to earn money to pay for rent and bills (62%)  finishing their course (62%)  mental health due to isolation (55%)  and getting essential food and medical supplies (50%) during the lockdown. While many universities have set up hardship funds  the Scottish government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support to help students facing . Campaigners would like Boris Johnson’s government to do the same. Becca Bland  chief executive of Stand Alone  which campaigns on behalf of students estranged from their parents and was one of three charities that carried out the survey  said: “Many students who are estranged from their family remain on campus as it is their primary residence. “We want the government to recognise  as the Scottish government has done  that losing income for students in this position will impact their ability to feed themselves  pay their rent and subsequently their chances of graduating.” The MPs’ letter to Rishi Sunak  the chancellor  warns that businesses relying on temporary student labour will find it far easier to hire a new cohort of students to fill vacancies when the shops  pubs and restaurants reopen  rather than furlough students that may not even be resident in the same city when the pandemic subsides. “Many of these students will not be able to find another job but will still be paying bills and rent. Full-time students are also not entitled to benefits through universal credit. Instead  they must rely on the generosity of their parents or guardians  some of whom will not be in the financial position to support their children.” Among those MPs who have have put their names to the letter are Caroline Lucas  from the Green party  Labour’s Clive Lewis  Claire Hanna of the SDLP in Northern Ireland  and Wera Hobhouse of the Liberal Democrats. The Treasury and the Department for Education have been contacted for comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14087518175df8136d41c126ed265a59181e38e7/0_170_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9004745068d4b8c2ed75fbca32636e7 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Students%2CEducation%2CHigher+education%2CSocial+exclusion%2CSociety%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CEducation+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/georgia-businesses-wary-governor-brian-kemp-reopen,us-news, 'It's way too early': Georgia businesses wary of governor's invitation to reopen, Critics say Brian Kemp’s decision to let nail salons  bowling alleys and restaurants open is political and not based on medical advice, The conservative Republican governor  Brian Kemp  has announced Georgians will be able to get a tattoo  go bowling and get their nails done starting on Friday and sit at a table in a restaurant at the start of next week. But Manuel’s Tavern posted a notice on its Facebook page with a blunt response. “All of our experience and the wisdom of some really smart people that work at the tavern think it’s way too early. As much as I would like to be open  it’s not happening. Being closed has not been fun  but it’s been the safest  best thing we could do for our staff and our customers.” The restaurant  where the former president Jimmy Carter announced his gubernatorial campaign in 1970 and Barack Obama played a game of darts in 2015  said to its fans  “Don’t hate us for being safe.” The opposing sides taken by the owners of Manuel’s – and many others like them in Georgia – and the state’s Republican leaders  backed by a few rightwing protest groups  are a microcosm of the controversy starting to play out across the US as some states push to reopen their economies in the face of dire warnings by many healthcare professionals. Across Atlanta  businesses are balking at the thought of allowing people into their establishments as Georgia’s coronavirus cases and deaths show no sign of following a sustained downward trajectory yet. According to federal recommendations  Georgia should not be opening up businesses until sometime in June. Critics of the governor call this a purely political move in a year in which he has faced much opposition  including from his own party. Kemp has been at odds even with the Republican-majority legislature this session for his decision to place Kelly Loeffler in a US Senate seat  and he is looking towards an election year when demographics point to the red  southern state swinging left. Critics say he is making decisions with politics uppermost in his mind  stirring a rightwing base in the hope of retaining power – much like Donald Trump. “This is absolutely a reckless political decision made to appease the president  despite the fact that experts tell us Georgia has neither enough widespread testing nor enough medical resources to reopen without endangering many lives ” said the Georgia Democratic party chair  Nikema Williams. The Guardian spoke with a dozen business owners and residents across the city and not one agreed with the new state guidelines. Even Kemp seems aware of the risks of reopening. When asked if the the state legislature’s session – suspended since 12 March – would also resume  the governor told WGAU’s Tim Bryant lawmakers were “waiting to come back until it’s a safe environment to do so  and have the proper protocols where  you know  we can make sure that that’s not a dangerous situation for anyone that would need to be at the Capitol”. He also mentioned in the same interview that he had asked his mother and his wife to stay home due to pre-existing conditions. Many of the governor’s critics say his decision to allow certain businesses to reopen will affect minority communities disproportionately  giving the dispute a racial tinge in a region already rife with such issues. “This virus has disproportionately impacted the lives of black and brown people. We cannot and will not stand silently by and watch the premature opening of businesses that are mostly in the African American communities ” the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus (GLBC) said in a group statement. Bernice A King  daughter of Martin Luther King Jr and Coretta Scott King  who is also on the governor’s outreach taskforce  only found out about the decision when a friend texted her  she said on Twitter. Killer Mike  the Atlanta-based rapper and barber shop owner who has been an advocate for the city’s African American community  said his business would not reopen. “Our first concern is ensuring the safety of our employees and patrons. While we obviously want to reopen  and we have an incentive to do so as business owners  we do not want to contribute to the spread of the virus ” he said in a statement to the Guardian. Kemp’s office did not respond to a request for comment  though he and Loeffler held a teleconference town hall on Wednesday. “We feel like we can create a business model while keeping tables separated and protecting our employees as well as our customers  so I think you will see some of that starting the first part of next week in a limited way ” Kemp said. “We’re asking people to continue to not travel or run errands unless they need to. Certainly they can go to these establishments that I just talked about and other ones that are necessary ” he added about soon-to-be open nail salons and bowling alleys. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/633fa97d8c4eec5f064a146defd07deb5316ef87/0_135_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9268aee176897c0ef57927a230078099 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e7b9232b9ae2b69a9019286c5d89f23e6e4455e/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3ae415fc32ec8fed988386118f5751f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e989edc1da45e95f1f92bed15c11c63ef2d476/0_53_4948_2969/master/4948.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67cdf20faa8064e79af676a19ee1e042 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Georgia%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CRepublicans%2CDemocrats https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus,world, Top vaccine expert says he was fired for resisting Trump on hydroxychloroquine, Rick Bright  who directed key government agency  tells New York Times refusal to embrace unproven treatment led to departure, Rick Bright was this week ousted as director of the US health department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  or Barda  and as the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response. In a stunningly candid statement  Bright highlighted his refusal to embrace hydroxychloroquine  a malaria drug relentlessly promoted by the president and Fox News despite a lack of scientific studies. “Specifically  and contrary to misguided directives  I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  promoted by the administration as a panacea  but which clearly lack scientific merit ” Bright said. “While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments  I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.” Asked about Bright at the White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday  Trump said: “I never heard of him. If a guy says he was pushed out of a job  maybe he was  maybe he wasn’t. You’d have to hear the other side. I don’t know who he is.” Trump repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as therapy for coronavirus  pointing to a Democratic state representative in Michigan who claimed it benefited her and frequently asking: “What do you have to lose?” But on Tuesday an analysis of the drug’s use in US veterans hospitals found no benefit. Bright added: “I insisted that these drugs be provided only to hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 while under the supervision of a physician. These drugs have potentially serious risks associated with them  including increased mortality observed in some recent studies in patients with Covid-19. “Sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis.” Bright has reportedly hired lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks  whose clients have included government whistleblowers and Christine Blasey Ford  who went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court nomination in 2018. On Wednesday  Ronald Klain  who led the Obama administration’s response to an Ebola outbreak in 2014  tweeted: “Dr Bright is a professional – an expert on vaccines – who I met during the Ebola response. If this is true  it … represents an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to put politics ahead of science and safety.” Dr Bright said he would request that the health department inspector general investigate the way in which the Trump administration has “politicised the work of Barda  and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections and efforts that lack scientific merit. “Rushing blindly towards unproven drugs can be disastrous and result in countless more deaths. Science  in service to the health and safety of the American people  must always trump politics.” Bright  whose entire career had been spent in vaccine development  had led Barda since 2016. He was moved to a less influential post at the National Institutes of Health. He told the New York Times: “I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions  and not in drugs  vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus  science – not politics or cronyism – has to lead the way.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/365395d208f8fb51a16ce944b87f89365fb6f42b/0_107_3217_1930/master/3217.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=593d858374a5da5307085cb31cc583d2 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CDonald+Trump%2CUS+politics%2CTrump+administration https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back,world, 'We’re in a prison': Singapore's migrant workers suffer as Covid-19 surges back, Singapore was lauded for its swift action to suppress infections but crisis has shone spotlight on how it treats marginalised migrants, Inside  the men who carry out backbreaking work to build Singapore’s infrastructure  sleep on bunk beds  crammed into rooms with as many as 20 people. The biggest dormitory complex houses up to 24 000 workers. In recent weeks  as the coronavirus has ripped through the facilities  their unsanitary and overcrowded conditions have quickly become the subject of international attention. Singapore  recently lauded for its gold-standard approach to testing and tracing  now demonstrates both the dangers of neglecting marginalised communities  and the vulnerability of nations to a second wave of infections. On Wednesday  the number of cases surpassed 10 000. This compares with just 200 infections recorded on 15 March  when its outbreak appeared to be nearly under control. Almost all new reports involve migrant workers. Last week  the country extended a partial shutdown that was introduced at the start of April  with people told to stay indoors as much as possible. All migrant workers have been told not to leave their dorms  and are instead having food delivered by authorities. “It feels like we’re in a prison. [It is] too difficult. [There is] too much heat in the room ” says A  who asked to remain anonymous  fearing that he might face repercussions for speaking to the media. Outside  the sound of ambulance sirens could be heard  he adds. None of the hundreds of people living on his floor has tested positive. When the coronavirus outbreak in China began to escalate in January  it was feared that Singapore  a major regional business hub  would be especially vulnerable. The country acted quickly to minimise the risk of transmission: border restrictions were introduced  an exhaustive contract-tracing programme rolled out and a home quarantine system was strictly enforced. Tests were also made free for all. The country  which avoided sweeping shutdown measures throughout March  appeared to have contained the virus. But rights groups say little attention was paid to migrant workers who  despite the pandemic  continued to live in close quarters  and spent hours a day travelling on the back of crowded lorries to get to and from construction sites. “The way the workers were stacked in [on the back of lorries]  it was like the way goats are stacked in when they are taken to a slaughter house ” says B  a second worker  who also asked to be anonymous. Activists say they raised concerns about the risks posed by the virus to migrant workers as early as February. In March  the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said the risk of an outbreak among this community was “undeniable”. When clusters began to emerge  the government moved 7 000 workers  mostly people who do essential jobs such as working on power plants  out of the buildings. About 293 000 remain housed in such facilities. Authorities say they will prioritise relocating older people. Cleaning services have been increased to improve hygiene  officials say  and meals are also being delivered to prevent workers needing to use communal kitchens. The outbreak has brought to the surface the glaring inequality in Singapore  which relies heavily on a workforce of about a million migrant workers to build its famous skyscrapers  and clean its gleaming shopping malls. Most have travelled to the country from Bangladesh  India and other south Asian countries  in the hope of sending money back home. Their lifestyles are a stark contrast to the country’s wealthy elite and financial workers. Kokila Annamalai  a local activist who supports migrant workers  fears that the spread of Covid-19 within the dormitories has fanned the flames of xenophobia and racism. She points to comments made online and in the media. “On top of [the view that] ‘it’s their fault for not being clean and for their eating habits’ and things like that  there is also this almost worse mindset of ‘they’re driving our numbers up and it makes us look bad on the world stage  and they should go home’ ” she said. While such remarks have been condemned by Singapore’s home affairs and law minister  Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam  campaigners say official messages have also been unhelpful. Workers have been urged to “be responsible”  wear face masks at all times  report symptoms to their dormitory operators and stay at least one metre from one another. A recent study by Mohan Dutta  a professor at Massey University in New Zealand  suggests such guidance is often just impractical. The overwhelming majority of about 100 workers surveyed said they were unable to maintain such a distance at all times. More than half described their rooms as unhygienic. Just last week  workers reported that they did not have enough soap to wash their hands. Workers are generally reluctant to voice complaints. Most take out huge debts in order to work in Singapore  often to find on arrival that they will be paid less than promised. A typical salary is around S$500-750 (£285-£425) a month. They are required to hold temporary work permits  but these are tied to their employer  making them extremely vulnerable to exploitation. B sold his family land and took loans so he could afford to pay an agency about S$7 000 to work in Singapore  where he hoped he would earn a high salary. As the eldest son  he is responsible for supporting his extended family  as well as his own wife and children. He knew that he would be required to work hard in Singapore  but his body was unprepared for the long hours of heavy lifting on construction sites. He did not expect that he would live  initially  in a container with eight others. “[I] had no idea that I would have to live like this and be in this much pain ” he said. Now  about a decade later  he says he is at least lucky to share a dorm room with just 12 people – fewer than many of his peers  and a contrast to his previous room  which had virtually no natural light. A also shares a room with 12 others. The heat is so suffocating  that everyone sleeps on the floor  he says. He is afraid to use the communal toilets  which are unclean. Many in Singapore are sympathetic towards the workers. “They deserve more. They deserve what every Singaporean deserves ” says William Lai  a photographer. “I don’t know what is going through the minds of these people [who blame workers] ... It is not their fault. They don’t want to be affected by this.” In a speech this week  Singapore’s prime minister  Lee Hsien Loong  said migrant workers would be cared for in the same way as Singaporeans: “We will look after your health  your welfare and your livelihood.” Almost all the migrant workers infected have only mild symptoms  he added. Dutta believes the crisis could present an opportunity to reform how migrant workers are treated  but he added that small tweaks would not be enough. “Substantive changes are needed in how Singapore looks at migrant workers  what rights migrant workers have  and how they are able to advocate for their own health and wellbeing ” says Dutta. B says that  for a start  migrant worker dormitories should be more strictly controlled  with caps on the number of workers allowed per room and per bathroom facilities. “It is not like Singapore cannot regulate it.” “This entire city is built on our labour and on our hard work ” he adds. “That tells you what you need to be told about the culture that we bring  and how our culture makes up the clean and sparkling facade of the city.” Workers  he adds  do not expect special kindness  just their basic labour rights.

23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-pandemic-is-becoming-a-human-rights-crisis-un-warns,world, Coronavirus pandemic is becoming a human rights crisis  UN warns, Report released on authoritarian responses  surveillance  closed borders and other rights abuses, Government responses to the crisis have been regarded as disproportionate in countries including China  India  Hungary  Turkey and South Africa. Guterres has already called for a global ceasefire  and has warned of a growth in domestic violence as a result of the virus  but the UN collectively has been criticised for failing to have an impact in the crisis. In his latest intervention  he warned “the virus is having a disproportionate impact on certain communities through the rise of hate speech  the targeting of vulnerable groups  and the risks of heavy handed security responses undermining the health response”. In its new report on Covid-19 and human rights  the UN highlighted the use of phrases such as “foreigner’s disease” to describe the virus  saying such remarks can lead to discrimination  xenophobia  racism and attacks. Releasing the report  Guterres called for any states of emergency to be proportionate and time limited  with a specific focus and duration. Freedom of movement needed to be curtailed  he accepted  but he said the scale of such restrictions can be reduced by effective testing and targeted quarantine measures. He reported more than 131 countries have closed their borders  with only 30 allowing exemptions for asylum seekers. Thousands  the UN said in its briefing paper  “have been pushed back or deported to dangerous environments since the crisis began. Refugees  IDPs [internally displaced persons] and migrants live in overcrowded conditions with unlimited access to sanitation and healthcare”. The UN pointed out that sometimes under the pretext of fake news  journalists  doctors  healthcare workers and activists or political opposition were being arrested. Online surveillance and aggressive cyber policy were on the increase. “Sweeping efforts to eliminate misinformation or disinformation can result in purposeful or unintentional censorship that underpins trust ” it said. The best solution  Guterres said  was for governments to be open and transparent about their efforts to constrain the virus  including by allowing their opposition or civil society groups to scrutinise the executive online. Although the UN acknowledged new technologies can help the fight against the virus  including by analysing its spread  “the use of artificial intelligence and big data to enforce emergency measures or to track impacted populations raise concerns ” he warned. The UN’s report further notes that “the potential for abuse is high: what is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed. “Without adequate safeguards  these powerful technologies may cause discrimination  be intrusive and infringe on privacy  or may be deployed against people or groups for purposes going far beyond the pandemic response.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a82ef3889f3e8598975d1390053a6664b00550d7/0_417_5355_3215/master/5355.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2bdbe71a09345b2354709b9716371791 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUnited+Nations%2CHuman+rights%2CWorld+news%2CGlobal+development%2CSurveillance%2CRefugees%2CMigration https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online,world, EU leaders clash over trillion-euro Covid-19 aid in online meeting, Virtual summit debates rescue package to protect single market from slumpEU summits swap huddles and wine for muted mics and pop art Coronavirus delivers a ‘moment of truth’ on the meaning of the EU, Meeting via video-conference summit  as the confirmed Covid-19 death toll passed 108 000 lives across the European Economic Area and UK  the 27 leaders instructed the head of the EU executive  Ursula von der Leyen  to draft a recovery plan. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the group that the health emergency had become an economic and social emergency  “but now we are facing a political emergency as well”. Italy swung behind Spain’s €1.5tn plan for grants for the hardest-hit countries  funded by “perpetual” (non-maturing) bonds. French president Emmanuel Macron also threw his weight behind the idea  saying: “Europe has no future if we cannot find a response to this exceptional shock.” He said the scale of the crisis demanded financial transfers to the hardest-hit states  and not just loans. But Germany  Sweden  the Netherlands and other northern countries are wary of financial transfers  preferring loans. The divide between grants and loans has superseded the previous EU split between countries seeking jointly issued EU debt and those opposed – a divide that also loosely fell on north-south lines. The European council president  Charles Michel  who chaired the meeting  did not ask EU leaders to sign off a formal summit text  to avoid hours of rows over a single line in a document as happened at the previous EU virtual summit. Von der Leyen said that “arguments have been exchanged tonight but in a very constructive manner”. She noted: “There will certainly be a sound balance between grants and loans  and this is a matter of negotiation within the group of member states” and added that both had pros and cons. The commission president also warned that the “health situation is not yet fully under control and many member states have not yet reached the peak”. Her economic rescue plan is likely to draw on a €2 trillion proposal drafted by her officials that includes a potential €323bn recovery fund  raising funds on capital markets  and agreeing the tortured question of the EU’s next seven-year budget. German chancellor Angela Merkel said a recovery fund was in Germany’s interest  and that her country would have to make higher contributions to the EU budget. “In the spirit of solidarity  we should be prepared to make completely different  that is to say significantly higher  contributions to the European budget over a set period ” Merkel told the Bundestag before the summit. Joining the leaders on the call was Christine Lagarde  the head of the European Central Bank  who warned leaders of the risks of doing too little too late as she forecast that eurozone output could drop by 15% in 2020 in the worst-case scenario. As expected  the leaders endorsed a €540bn rescue package drafted by their finance ministers earlier this month. Part of that agreement gives countries the right to borrow from the eurozone bailout fund  the European Stability Mechanism. But Italy  the country hardest hit by the pandemic  is reluctant to turn to the fund  which critics say stigmatises the borrower  and Spain has said it does not need to. Along with other southern European nations  they are seeking transfers to rescue their economies. The debate on “perpetual” debt issued by the EU institutions is likely to be fraught  especially when allied to the search for compromise on the EU budget for 2021-27  which is already behind schedule after leaders failed to reach an agreement in February. The commission is now urging EU leaders to agree the budget by June 2020. “[The word] ‘perpetual’ when it comes together with ‘debt’  that is difficult to swallow for some of our member states ” said a senior EU official ahead of the summit. “The difficulty here is that every leader also has a domestic public opinion  which means public opinion and also a parliament. These leaders are ready to go to some efforts  but they have to face their own domestic problems.” Senior politicians fear the EU’s unity could fracture if the divide widens between the strongest economies and the weaker ones which have struggled to emerge from the financial crisis. “The crisis risks damaging permanently the growth potential of member states  which already face bottlenecks to growth ” an internal commission paper  seen by the Guardian  states. Germany  which takes over the EU rotating presidency from July  is backing calls for any recovery plan to be integrated into the next EU budget. In a less contentious moment  EU leaders approved guidance from Brussels on lifting the lockdown. The commission  urging caution  has set out three criteria for judging how and when to end restrictions: stable and significant decline in the spread of the disease; health system capacity; and availability of widespread testing and tracing systems to monitor future outbreaks. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ce36705a5a0212dfeb99f85e1cb9d5caea6842/0_75_4960_2978/master/4960.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=774890f77e26bf506c0499abda0f16c4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8721779e2aae5195d2ff32d48a608737a99d66e/0_77_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4985b53ef2cdc3d6180229eed97e6e1d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Larry-Elliott,-R.png https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEuropean+commission%2CEurope%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEconomics%2CEconomic+recovery%2CSpain%2CItaly%2CNetherlands%2CGermany%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/eu-summits-swap-huddles-and-wine-for-muted-mics-and-pringles-pop-art,world, EU summits swap huddles and wine for muted mics and Pringles pop art, Virtual meetings bring technical problems  differences in decor and questions of trust, On Thursday European leaders were holding their fourth virtual meeting in seven weeks. It is a format far removed from the norm  where prime ministers and presidents hole up in the modern oak and glass Europa building in Brussels for the best part of 24 hours  and political rows and textual wrangles are accompanied by gourmet dinners and fine wine. A virtual summit means none of the air kissing and back-slapping that usually happens when leaders get together in person. It also makes the meetings shorter  although finance ministers got bogged down on a video call for 16 hours this month as they failed to agree on an economic rescue plan. (They resolved their differences on a separate call two days later.) The video conference does provide a glimpse into the chancelleries and presidential palaces of Europe. For most leaders  the conventional backdrop is the national and European flag side by side. An image of the first video summit showed that only Hungary’s Viktor Orbán did not have the blue and gold-starred flag in shot. Luxembourg’s prime minister  Xavier Bettel  has the most eye-catching decor – a large pop art painting of the beaming face of the Pringles logo  by the Luxembourger artist Milli Schlesser. The work is part of Bettel’s private collection  which also includes images of Marilyn Monroe  Andy Warhol and a ceramic bust of Tintin (sadly not in shot). The summits are not broadcast  so any technical glitches disappear into the encrypted ether. It’s a different story at the European parliament  which has been running virtually since the pandemic took hold. One recent meeting between the parliament’s civil liberties committee and two Greek ministers showed how painful video-conferencing can be. “Señor Chrisochoïdis  are you there? Can you speak please ” the committee’s Spanish vice-chair  Maite Pagazaurtundúa  asked Michális Chrisochoïdis  the Greek minister for citizen protection  who was due on the line. “Please just press the button  that way you can speak. Press the button and then you can speak please.” The problem was not immediately resolved. “Please press the speak button and try again.” Meeting by video conference poses more than just technical problems. Luuk van Middelaar  a former adviser to the European council president and a scholar of EU crises  thinks the format makes it impossible to build trust in difficult moments. “The recipe of EU decision-making at summit level is that [leaders] are meeting in person. They can look each other in the eye  they can speak de vive voix [personally]. It’s not about states meeting  it’s about people meeting ” he told the Guardian. Current insiders tend to agree. “It’s not like you can work something out in the margins of the council – and that is where the real music plays ” one EU diplomat said. “Some of the leaders  some of the advisers get together and try to sketch a way forward  but this is not possible in a video conference  at least not in the same way.” When things get difficult at a regular summit  leaders and their most trusted advisers gather around tables in small groups or huddle in corridors  searching for common ground or writing and rewriting text – diplomatic heavy lifting captured in a rare photograph in March 2019. Some sources think it will be near impossible to agree one of the most contentious items on the EU agenda  the next seven-year budget  without a face-to-face meeting. The exercise will involve reconciling spenders with savers in the middle of a major economic downturn. “When you talk about this huge negotiation  it is going to be difficult to do this by video conference ” a senior official said. “At one point  in the endgame  maybe a physical meeting will be needed.” But for now  leaders will have to dial in for compromise. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/12/26/Jennifer_Rankin,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e12882f2580d0f8384b06b108a89b53f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01cbc71b699baa176fd7a8e64e4ad8167bd32328/98_31_1162_698/master/1162.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c2cc552bfdbc192ecd1bb4fe61ee2b54 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-delivers-a-moment-of-truth-on-the-meaning-of-the-eu,world, Coronavirus delivers a 'moment of truth' on the meaning of the EU, The issue of recovery funds shapes up as an acid test of commitment to the union, It is a perennial question found lurking in the background of all EU negotiations over long-term budgets  not least the most recent inconclusive and toxic talks in which north was pitted against south. But it comes now at a time of dangerously raw emotional upheaval when popular opinions on the worth of institutions are peculiarly malleable. The question being posed by events is whether there is enough of a sense of kinship among EU citizens for national governments to back the most radical of the burden-sharing plans proposed to rebuild the eurozone economy as one. And if not  can the Italians  in particular  be convinced of the added value of the union? For all the inevitable prevarication  ill-concealed by a smokescreen of Eurojargon and acronyms  we are approaching what Emmanuel Macron has described as a moment of truth. The European economy is in a slow-motion car crash with the coronavirus. Initial impact has been made. The full scale of the damage will not be clear for months to come. There will be a vast number of deaths. There will also be a savage economic recession. Analysts predict a near doubling of unemployment in the EU  with whole swathes of industry collapsing. The depth of the crash and its repercussions in the political sphere will be decided to a significant degree by the nature and range of spending in the immediate months and years. That will involve huge debt  and with that comes the question of where liability for it lies and who controls how the money is spent. If governments try to come out of this crisis through national borrowing alone  it is possible  even probable  that the debt accrued by the least productive economies will come to be seen as unsustainable by the markets. Economies could slide into despair  risking further joblessness  hunger  destitution. Some countries might seek to restrict their borrowing for fear of such an outcome  but they risk their economies shrivelling in relation to their EU neighbours. In either scenario  the EU would be in a dangerous predicament in which cries of betrayal would be strongly heard as some stride out of the pit of the crisis for which all European countries are equally blameless. The Italian answer to this has been the so-called coronabonds under which eurozone countries would  from now  commonly raise debt on the markets and be jointly liable. That concept goes some way to presuming there is an EU community of people in support of a transfer union  where the richest help pay the way for the poorest and the countries more strongly positioned in this crisis sacrifice for the weakest. “Europe has to come up with an answer ” the Italian prime minister  Giuseppe Conte  demanded. The Netherlands  Austria  Finland and Germany are opposed to the concept of coronabonds. They raise the issue of moral hazard in that such a policy would seemingly punish those countries that had saved for a rainy day  and say it could risk further fiscal irresponsibility. Angela Merkel  the German chancellor  has raised the issue of democratic accountability by suggesting there is not sufficient political union among the 27 for such shared debt. The Dutch prime minister  Mark Rutte  well aware that the forces in support of “Nexit” – led by characters such as the Eurosceptic politician Thierry Baudet – could make mischief  has said such bonds would be in breach of the EU treaties. There are ways out of this dilemma  as there have been in the past. Should Italy stop presenting agreement on coronabonds as a test of solidarity  the commission has suggested a €300bn recovery fund in the 2021-27 budget. The commission would also borrow €320bn from the capital markets for targeted spending. Perhaps Italian and Spanish voters will regard this as satisfactory. Their leaders have  however  set a high bar for the EU  which it is not at all clear it is able to meet. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09b8808e86751d86d7a3d39a8738777bd3a1f39f/0_57_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=081bfec1904db953e8b7999cc05cb224 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58672bd09f9d352bc9de500a1a6aa54d713d3b3a/0_290_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6f72b64406b65050c399c913b996af0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7f6b92ffb214678c9c165df6709c9b4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd15ba3734af2baadd0bae01d5af5f35fde115c9/212_0_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ca00fb30b8e354c5966ebc9ec0ce54f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1884d395d61e37a249940f1e0ab785d0bbc5d5d/0_129_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=96e7299e901492267665ab09ead109b4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CGermany%2CNetherlands%2CItaly%2CGlobal+economy%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/23/itll-cause-a-water-war-divisions-run-deep-as-filling-of-nile-dam-nears,global-development, 'It'll cause a water war': divisions run deep as filling of Nile dam nears, Despite Egypt’s fears of ‘hydro hegemony’ and concerns it will worsen water shortages in Sudan  Ethiopia’s controversial dam project is close to fruition, This conviction led Mufti  a prominent human rights lawyer and water expert  to quit the Sudanese delegation that is negotiating Nile water issues with Egypt and Ethiopia. He was angry at Ethiopia’s decision to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam (Gerd)  a $4.5bn (£3.6bn) mega-project on the Blue Nile river that runs from Lake Tana in Ethiopia to meet the White Nile in Khartoum  flowing north into Egypt. The dam project will affect water levels downstream  depending on how fast Ethiopia fills its 74bn cubic metre reservoir. “I believe in one  two  10 … 100 years  this will cause instability in the region. These are the germs of instability  and it will cause a water war ” he says emphatically. “If not under this government then under another  as no population will see itself dying of thirst when they know that there is water very close by. This was my position when I quit  and every day since then I find more evidence that supports this.” Ethiopia is due to begin filling the dam’s reservoir later this year  following a decade of fraught negotiations between the Nile Basin countries. In early April  Ethiopia’s prime minister  Abiy Ahmed  declared that construction would be completed despite the challenges of the pandemic  with the reservoir to be filled during the rainy season that starts in June. “Saving lives is our priority  while second to this we have the Gerd ” he told Ethiopians. Sudan’s prime minister  Abdalla Hamdok  proposed “joint management” of the dam  which will deplete Sudan’s water from the Blue Nile while potentially providing much-needed cheap electricity in future. Further downstream  however  Egypt has long seen the Gerd as an existential threat that could deprive its 100 million people of the water they need to survive in a changing climate. Some Egyptian officials have even discussed bombing the dam. Ethiopia and Sudan say the dam’s hydropower is essential for their citizens to develop and thrive. Mufti fingers prayer beads as he talks: “I believe that within one year of the filling of the dam’s reservoir  shortcomings will start to appear ” he says. “This dam is endangering rights – the right to life and the right to work.” He also fears the dam itself risks collapse. “There will be a shortage of water  and a lack of safety of the dam abrogating [the] human right to life of the Sudanese people.” Mufti left Sudan’s delegation to the talks in 2010 after Ethiopia declared it would continue building. Now  in addition to his human rights work  he spends his days touring farming communities to warn them of the risks of the Gerd and working on a newsletter that follows dam developments in minute detail. He has written several books on the subject. “This one is intended as a record  so that when things go wrong I can say the information was there ” he says  pushing a paperback over his large desk. In January  the tense discussions between the three nations came to a head in Washington. US-mediated talks had secured a preliminary agreement between the trio  including an understanding that a staged filling process would be undertaken in the wet season. The three countries also said they needed to reach agreement on the later stages  not least on the thorny issue of how to manage during dry times. Much depends on the Blue Nile  which has been impacted by the changing climate. When Egypt and Sudan returned to Washington to negotiate and sign the final deal in February  Ethiopian negotiators declined to attend  stating that more time was needed to deliberate. The US secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  said a final agreement on the dam could take “months” to resolve. Ethiopia’s position fuelled an escalating war of words. Egypt accused Addis Ababa of “intent to exercise hydro-hegemony”  raising the issue with the Arab League and Donald Trump. Ethiopia claimed the US president had “inaccurate and inadequate information” about the issue  while Egypt’s foreign minister conducted a Middle East tour to rally support. Egypt has repeatedly tried to win Sudan over to its position on the dam  even taking steps to end a decades-long border dispute. Sudan hopes the dam will provide cheap electricity  and has long attempted to strike a balance between Egypt and Ethiopia  attending talks in Washington but declining to sign an Arab League statement condemning Ethiopia. Mufti has seen Sudan’s stance as a fool’s errand  pointing to a declaration of principles signed by the three nations in 2015. “What this says is that if there is excess  if  then downstream countries like Sudan will get priority to buy it! If!” he says furiously. “No specific quantity  no prices  nothing – if! And the potential generation is expected to be 6 000 megawatts when this was written down  but initially engineers are saying production won’t exceed 2 000  so there will never be excess. If there’s an excess  this will be sold at regular prices – and right now Egypt is giving Sudan electricity.” Mufti believes that  in the end  regional politics has won  and Sudan has been sold a lie of cheap power. “This is what has been sold to the Sudanese people – it’s not true.” On the bank of the Blue Nile  farmer Abdullah Ali points at the river. The water doesn’t cover the riverbed  exposing a wide streak of brown sandy earth. Ali has extended a pump from his dry farmland to catch some of the river water closest to the bank  but soon he will have to extend it much further. “The water level is down – even today ” he says. He is 65 and has been a farmer for his entire adult life  but this is new. “It’s never been this bad before. Last year at this time  the water was plentiful.” The Blue Nile offers a terrifying picture of the climate crisis – not just for Sudan’s water resources but for the entire region. Ali walks over cracked soil as he points at the remaining crops with his cane  his long white robe billowing in the winds. As Sudan  Egypt and Ethiopia argue over the Nile Basin’s waters  the climate crisis is encroaching. Ali wants the river to sustain his crops  which this year featured much more alfalfa because it can be grown in dry areas. But this meant fewer profits; alfalfa does not generate as much profit as the tomatoes and okra he sells in Khartoum. The lack of water also meant money was needed for a diesel-powered pump for irrigation. He knows the exposed riverbed means that communities downstream will experience drought. The water levels were so low  he was convinced that the Ethiopian authorities had begun filling the dam’s reservoir  decreasing the flow to the Blue Nile. “I think the dam is affecting us here ” he says  repeating the fears of other local farmers. The lack of water is already displacing people. “I know farmers who have given up their land and have moved to work with others who can afford pumps ” says Ali  who fears the same fate if he can’t keep up with the increasing costs. “We have never been tired like this year. With this amount of water  how can I farm? We don’t go to the government for the solution ” he says bitterly. Further up the bank  cotton farmer Hassan Khallafallah was proud of this year’s crop  but worried about next year. His fields of cotton rustle in the wind  with fluffy white buds stretching up to the clear blue sky. “I’m worried for Sudan ” he says. “Right now  I’m not affected [by the lack of water]  but in future I will be.” He is concerned about the Gerd the progress of which he has followed closely in the news. Khallafallah has already noticed shifting weather patterns and lower water levels in the irrigation channels. On the banks of the main channel that supplies water to his fields  he says: “You see – there’s less water in the channel. We expect that after April  there just won’t be enough.” Khallafallah has been buoyed by Sudan’s transition to democracy  and says he would like to push the government on the issue of water in future. “This is a problem for the irrigation ministry. I would go to Khartoum to talk to them.” Yet Sudan’s Gerd negotiator  Salih Hamad Hamid  of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources  is confident the country can handle some loss of water resources while reaping the benefits of cheap hydropower. “Sudan seeks to secure its water rights and achieve optimal benefit from the shared Blue Nile waters. The Sudanese proposal optimises the power generation from the Gerd – Ethiopia’s objective – and minimises harm during filling and operation to both downstream countries of Sudan and Egypt ” he said in a statement to the Guardian. Hamid stressed that the countries had “agreed on a filling timetable of seven stages. This can increase or decrease from seven years”  according to drought and water levels  lengthening the timetable if the water levels of the Blue Nile are lower than average. A shared filling timetable is needed because the dam will create a reservoir twice the size of the Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead  the largest reservoir in the US  decreasing the flow of the Blue Nile by up to 25% and potentially decreasing the power of Egypt’s Aswan dam. While the preliminary agreement mentions potential dry periods  there has been extraordinarily little mention of climate change  an undeniable threat to water resources. Sudanese supporters of the dam say the annual rainy season that helps the Nile flood provides more than enough water. In their eyes  the Blue Nile and Sudan have water to spare  which could be traded for hydro electricity. But studies show that Nile Basin countries will be subject to longer dry periods. Scientists from the American Geophysical Union have warned that  “despite projected increases in regional precipitation due to climate change  the frequency of hot and dry years is likely to also rise due to warming. These increased hot and dry extremes will stress regional agriculture  and coupled with rapid population growth  they will exacerbate water scarcity across the Upper Nile Basin in the coming decades”. Two of those scientists  Ethan Coffel and Justin Mankin  have sounded the alarm about how people are at risk. “At present  around 10% of the basin’s population faces chronic water scarcity due to the region’s seasonal aridity and highly unequal distribution of water resources ” they said. Water is already a scarce resource in parts of Darfur and other desertified areas of Sudan  with conflict over the precious resource potentially exacerbated by climate change. They warned that by 2040  up to 35% of those living in the Nile Basin countries could be facing water scarcity. “That’s more than 80 million people without enough water to function in their daily lives ” they said. On the Fenti Golf course just outside Khartoum  concerns about water resources appear distant. Sprinklers spray the turf  which is surrounded by verdant flower beds  and date palms ring artificial lakes filled with carp and topped off with several fountains. “These are all drains  so any surplus water goes straight into the water table ” says owner Osama Daoud Abdellatif  pointing to a grate in the grass across the 120-acre course. He is Sudan’s most famous tycoon  and he supports the Gerd project. As our golf buggy splashes through puddles on the paths around the course  he points to areas earmarked for exclusive housing. Abdellatif declined to say how much water his course uses  insisting the vast majority of water is recycled. “Look at the amount of water and the impact of having a green area.

23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/nova-scotia-shooting-emergency-alert,world, Nova Scotia shooting: residents ask why authorities didn't send emergency alert, Residents say emergency alert during shooting spree could have saved lives as gunman drove around the province for over 12 hours, A week before Canada’s worst-ever mass shooting  all residents of the province received a mobile phone alert asking them to remain at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many argue that a similar warning during the shooting spree could have saved lives. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Wednesday that the active shooter situation over the weekend was “dynamic” and “fluid” as officers scrambled to locate the gunman  delaying an emergency message broadcast to the public. “We were in the process of preparing an alert when the gunman was shot and killed by the RCMP ” Chief Superintendent Chris Leather told reporters. The first reports of gunfire came late on Saturday  and police officers were dispatched to a home in the town of Portapique. At 11.32pm  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent out a tweet asking residents to “stay in their homes with doors locked at this time”. But for the following eight hours  the Twitter account was silent  even as gunman Gabriel Wortman prowled the province in a replica police vehicle. Police believe the first victims were targeted  but Wortman went on to attack anyone on his path. It wasn’t until 8.02am on Sunday that the police sent another tweet  warning that there was an “active shooter situation” and that Wortman was probably disguised as an RCMP officer. Residents were once again asked to stay home and lock their doors. But by then  a number of residents – many of whom had heard about the incident the night before – assumed police had cleared up the situation. Nick Beaton told CTV news that as he and his pregnant wife Kristen started their day  in the town of Truro  they believed the incident had long passed. “We thought he was taken care of ” Nick Beaton said. By the time he realized the gunman was still at large  Kristen had left to begin her shift as a care worker. Nick desperately texted a picture of Wortman to his wife – but she never received he message. Her body was recovered later on Sunday. “If I had known he was on the loose I would have not let my wife leave the house that day ” Beaton told CTV. Lillian Hyslop was also killed by Wortman as she walked along a familiar stretch of country road on Sunday morning. Friends have also said that an alert would have kept Hyslop at home. On Tuesday  Nova Scotia’s premier  Stephen McNeil  said the province had activated the emergency management office by Sunday morning – which includes preparing for the release of an emergency alert to all telephones in the province – but the RCMP never requested an alert be sent. “In this case  the RCMP has to ask for that alert to go out  because quite frankly  we need the information from them. McNeil said  having previously told reporters that we wasn’t prepared to “second-guess” decisions that were made in a rapidly evolving situation. Such comments have angered many locals. “If that is not an emergency  what is? The death toll is rising. He has not been taken into custody. At what point do you decide that people need to be warned?” said Maggie Rahr  a freelance investigative journalist in Nova Scotia  told the Guardian. Meanwhile  the Canadian Press has reported that the US consulate in Nova Scotia emailed citizens on Sunday  warning of an active shooter. “It’s our protocol – when emergencies occur – to alert US citizens in the area of the situation ” said a consulate spokeswoman  Marcia R Seitz-Ehler. The RCMP previously defended their decision to use social media channels on Facebook and Twitter for their “instantaneous” way of communicating. “We’re aware that we have thousands of followers in Nova Scotia and felt that it was a way  a superior way to communicate this ongoing threat ” Ch Supt Leather told reporters on Monday. Police have yet to determine what motivated the shooting spree  and the death toll is expected to rise still further as 16 crime scenes are investigated. The head RCMP initially said Wortman was not “known to police”  but court documents show that in 2002 he pleaded guilty to assaulting a 15-year-old boy in the parking lot of a denture clinic. Wortman was ordered to undergo counselling for anger management and banned from possessing firearms  explosives and any prohibited weapon for nine months. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/193bb28c01c4226eeb48adeaa38930e4910e606b/0_0_3000_2207/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c34a4a9a2eae4056c09969eb498b9cfd https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Nova+Scotia+shooting%2CCanada%2CAmericas https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/uk-seeks-to-borrow-225bn-to-fund-huge-surge-in-public-spending,business, UK seeks to borrow £225bn to fund huge surge in public spending, Borrowing for just four months nears annual peak figure for 2009-10 financial crisis as coronavirus ravages economy, In an early indicator of the soaring financial costs of the crisis  the Treasury said its debt management office – which sells bonds to finance the government’s spending requirements – would offer investors £180bn worth of gilts to buy between May and July  on top of £45bn already planned for April. Taken together the borrowing requirement in the first four months of the new year comes close to the annual peak in gilt sales recorded during the financial crisis  when Britain sold £227.6bn of bonds in 2009-10. Before the coronavirus struck  the government had planned to sell about £160bn worth of bonds in 2020-21 to fund its expenditure and service its debts. The Treasury said it expected the bulk of gilt sales this year to come in the four months to July  given the “immediate financing needs resulting from Covid-19”  and that it hoped higher levels of bond issuance were not required for the remainder of the financial year. The government’s gilt sales to City investors and overseas asset managers are typically higher than the budget deficit – the annual shortfall between public spending and income from tax receipts – as it includes raising money to refinance existing government bonds. However  the vast increase in gilt sales suggests that borrowing is expected to balloon  as the state pays workers’ wages and as more people claim unemployment benefits. The government’s independent economics forecaster  the Office for Budget Responsibility  has said that Britain’s budget deficit could rise to £273bn this year if lockdown measures are maintained for three months  more than £200bn higher than previously expected. Figures published earlier on Thursday showed Britain borrowed £48.7bn last year  around £1.3bn more than expected  indicating that the government finances were already deteriorating before the coronavirus struck. The Office for National Statistics said the budget deficit had increased by £9.3bn compared with 2018-19  as public spending increased by more than tax receipts  including on the government’s financial settlement to boost NHS funding. Although the deficit had steadily fallen since a peak of almost £160bn during the financial crisis a decade ago  the ONS warned that the increase last year was the largest annual rise since that point. Thomas Pugh  UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics  said the plan to ramp up gilt sales was the first concrete sign of higher borrowing emerging amid the coronavirus crisis. “The government measures to combat the economic fallout of the coronavirus at the same time as revenues are hit by the huge contraction in economic output is a double whammy for the public finances ” he added. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf13da788e592c19ddd4ee850f99e4424c581f25/0_335_5896_3543/master/5896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7f3db16a9d38033b81e1aac3a213a8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Government+borrowing%2CBudget+deficit%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomics%2CManufacturing+sector%2CRetail+industry%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CPublic+finance%2CBonds%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CTax+and+spending%2COffice+for+Budget+Responsibility%2CFinancial+sector%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/thousands-of-firms-may-fail-if-rescue-schemes-not-expanded-says-cbi,business, Thousands of firms may fail if rescue schemes not expanded  says CBI, More grants and loans needed to help small businesses weather Covid-19 lockdown  say leaders, The CBI said ministers needed to address shortcomings in the loans scheme for small and medium-sized businesses  under which 16 624 firms have borrowed £2.8bn to date  up from £1.1bn a week earlier. Carolyn Fairbairn  the director general of the CBI  said that without an extension of the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) and a fresh round of grants for small companies that failed to qualify for loans  the Covid-19 crisis would push thousands of previously solvent firms to the wall. Fairbairn said a scheme for the smallest companies that need to borrow less than £25 000 should be created and supported with 100% government-backed loans. A scheme offering loans of up to £500 000  with 80% covered by the state  should be upgraded to have 100% of the loan covered by government guarantees  she said. The latest weekly data released by the banking lobby group UK Finance on Thursday showed that lending under CBILS had reached 16 624 firms. That is just 40% of the 36 000 formal applications lodged with banks so far. While approvals have increased from a 21% rate a week earlier  critics are still concerned that banks are not able to get money fast enough to businesses that need it most. UK Finance has not yet confirmed how many applications have been rejected  and it said the remaining figure accounted for both rejections and loans still being processed. In France  commercial banks have processed loans under a similar scheme and distributed about £20bn to more than 170 000 firms. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses have also campaigned for reforms to the current arrangements. The BCC’s head of economics  Suren Thiru  said: “The increase in companies accessing CBILS is encouraging progress. However  the number of applications processed and approved will need to be increased significantly in what is a crunch week for firms urgently trying to access financial support. A concerningly high number of businesses are still finding accessing the scheme too complex and too lengthy.” Ann Francke  the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute (CMI)  said a survey of its members found that a third of small and medium-sized company managers felt existing measures would not ease their financial distress. “We urgently need to streamline the execution by which funds and support get to businesses with simple  fast processes  clear accountability and communication. This needs better management ” she said. Stephen Jones  the chief executive of UK Finance  said the banking industry understood the critical role it was playing during the outbreak and frontline staff were working tirelessly to get money out to viable businesses as quickly as possible. Some lenders have been more successful in getting cash out to struggling businesses than others. Royal Bank of Scotland alone accounts for about 40% of the total number and value of loans issued to date  having approved 6 518 loans worth £1.1bn. That is down slightly from its 50% standing a week earlier  suggesting some of its peers are starting to gain ground. Barclays has approved 2 971 loans worth £586m to date  while HSBC has issued 3 539 loans worth £480.5m. Lloyds said it had issued £335m after approving around 80% of the 2 876 formal applications it received so far. The business secretary  Alok Sharma  was questioned by MPs on the business  energy and industrial strategy committee on Thursday and acknowledged that loans to small firms needed to be processed more quickly. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edf629d89502afe0acd442ccbf7d25f01a486609/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9144e098e2c910f4c9526b71d037db29 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Confederation+of+British+Industry+%28CBI%29%2CSmall+business%2CEconomic+policy%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-lockdown-tips-uk-economy-into-biggest-slump-on-record,business, Coronavirus lockdown tips UK economy into biggest slump on record, Recession and unprecedented squeeze on incomes likely  says Bank of England policymaker,  Gertjan Vlieghe  a member of the BoE’s interest-rate setting committee  said the UK was heading for a squeeze on incomes that was unprecedented in its speed and severity. In a health check of the UK economy ahead of the monetary policy committee’s next meeting in May  he said: “Based on the early indicators  and based on the experience in other countries that were hit somewhat earlier than the UK  it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century  or possibly several centuries.” Britain is expected to enter a recession in the first half of the year after large parts of the economy were forced to shut and workers stay at home as part of efforts to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak. Data firm IHS Markit said its UK composite purchasing managers index (PMI)  which tracks activity across the services and manufacturing sectors  slumped to just 12.9 for April  down from 36 in March and a record since the survey began in the 90s. This was far below economists’ forecasts and well short of the 38.1 reading recorded in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. A PMI figure above 50 indicates an expansion of business activity. Amid warnings that tackling the pandemic could wreck developed and developing world economies for several years  IHS Markit said the dive in activity in the UK and the eurozone was the worst since it started surveying businesses more than two decades ago. Manufacturing and services companies reported a collapse in business  with the manufacturing PMI falling from 43.9 in March to 16.6 in April and the services PMI tumbling from 34.5 in March to 12.3 in April. The services sector accounts for about three-quarters of the UK’s business activity. IHS Markit said 80% of the UK service companies it surveyed reported a drop in activity this month  as did 75% of manufacturers. This was “overwhelmingly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic”  the data provider said. Many firms also reported record declines in new orders and backlogs of work and employment. Half of those surveyed said they had cut their workforce this month  with many saying they had furloughed staff. A survey of manufacturers by the business lobby group the CBI documented the same slide in business activity over the last quarter coupled an outlook with the fastest reduction in jobs since 1980 over the next quarter. The CBI said nearly half of businesses surveyed were expecting output to be limited by shortages of materials or components – the highest proportion since 1975. The eurozone also suffered the steepest fall in business activity and employment ever recorded  ahead of what is expected to be the deepest global recession in peacetime. The eurozone-wide composite PMI hit an all-time low of 13.5 in April  down from a prior record low of 29.7 in March  reflecting the wholesale shutdown of Europe’s economy this month. Chris Williamson  the chief business economist at IHS Markit  said that based on responses from business  the UK economy was likely to contract by 7% this year while the eurozone economy could fall by 7.5%. He said: “The level of business closures and social distancing measures have caused business activity to collapse at a rate vastly exceeding that seen even during the global financial crisis  confirming fears that GDP will slump to a degree previously thought unimaginable in the second quarter due to measures taken to contain the spread of the virus.” For the UK  he said the situation could be even worse as elements of business activity excluded from the survey fall at a faster rate. “The actual decline in GDP could be even greater  in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector  which have been especially hard-hit by the Covid-19 containment measures.” He said there was “one ray of light”  which came from an improvement in business optimism about the year ahead  compared with the all-time low recorded in March. “Sentiment about the coming year nevertheless remained the second-lowest ever recorded to underscore how few businesses are anticipating a swift recovery ” he said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8721779e2aae5195d2ff32d48a608737a99d66e/0_77_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4985b53ef2cdc3d6180229eed97e6e1d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ce36705a5a0212dfeb99f85e1cb9d5caea6842/0_75_4960_2978/master/4960.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=774890f77e26bf506c0499abda0f16c4 https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Larry-Elliott,-R.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3313937fe9a72df8ea863770c4ec9894b922827d/0_80_5067_3041/master/5067.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6689dbf760663b9c41c92c20977d0d57 https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Simon-Jenkins,-L.png https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Recession%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomic+recovery%2CEconomics%2CGlobal+recession%2CGlobal+economy%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CTax+and+spending%2CPublic+finance%2CBudget+deficit%2CGovernment+borrowing%2COffice+for+Budget+Responsibility%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CServices+sector https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-will-cause-lasting-changes-to-shopping-habits-says-unilever-boss,business, Coronavirus will cause 'lasting changes' to shopping habits  says Unilever boss, Alan Jope predicts continued growth in online shopping and continued higher sales of cleaning products, Unilever’s chief executive  Alan Jope  said the health crisis would accelerate the growth of online food shopping. He also predicted a permanent increase in demand for soap and other cleaning supplies as improved hygiene became a priority for households. “I think we will be able to look back and see this as a point of inflection for online grocery shopping ” he said. “Good luck getting an appointment for a grocery delivery. I think that will persist and we will adjust our approach to reflect that.” In the coming months  people would want to wash their hands more and be concerned about surface hygiene in homes  Jope added. “The whole hygiene thing will carry on.” Unilever  which owns more than 400 brands  was updating investors after a torrid three months in which the business experienced seesawing levels of demand. While shoppers filled kitchen cupboards with jars of the group’s Hellman’s mayonnaise  Pot Noodles and Cif surface spray  the lockdown forced consumers to cut back on products such as Cornetto and Magnum ice-cream  which are reliant on sales to the cafe and restaurant trade. The shift to home working had also sapped demand for grooming products such as shampoo and deodorant  with Jope conceding that people “shaving a bit less” was hitting demand for razors. Unilever rang up sales of €12.4bn in first three months of 2020  level with a year ago and short of analyst expectations. In common with other companies  the Anglo-Dutch group withdrew its financial guidance as it navigated its way through what Jope described as a “human crisis”. Demand for its cleaning and hygiene products  such as Cif and Domestos bleach  jumped more than 10% in the first three months of 2020  resulting in an overall 2.4% increase in its homecare sales. However  the collapse in demand for ice-cream put a drag on food sales  which fell 1.7% after orders from traditional tourist hotspots did not materialise  given the uncertain outlook going into the holiday season. The company was not tapping the government for financial support  Jope said. “We think that the government schemes to protect jobs and people’s livelihoods are intended for small businesses and sectors that are more under threat than Unilever’s ” he said. “We don’t think is intended for companies like ours; we would rather keep our destiny in our own hands.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d0bf77dc0b77662f157638bb68c4d990d768377/0_289_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57aa3b3be8876f11f572e0724dff634e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Unilever%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CSupermarkets%2CRetail+industry%2CFood+%26+drink+industry%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/us-unemployment-claims-benefits-coronavirus,business, US unemployment applications reach over 26m as states struggle to keep up, An additional 4.4 million Americans filed last week  as losses have wiped out all the job gains made since end of the last recession, The latest Department of Labor figures show the pace of layoffs appears to have slowed slightly but a backlog of claims mean millions more are likely to file in the coming weeks. States across the country are encountering problems with the sheer number of people applying for unemployment benefits. In Florida  bedevilled by the widespread collapse of its already flawed benefits system  just 14.2% of the more than 668 000 claims filed since 15 March have been paid. In Ohio  claimants now have to file on a specific day of the week  depending on the first letter of their last name  to ease congestion. Washington residents are complaining that the state’s website crashes or takes hours to respond. Latasha Johnson  41  has been struggling to get by without a paycheck for a month. In mid-March  she was laid off from her job in dining services at the University of Illinois  where she was employed by the British-based multinational Compass. She had no severance and it took a month for her to file an unemployment claim because the site was overwhelmed. Johnson said it was especially difficult because she is a single mother. “I pay for all my bills on my own  I don’t have any outside help  outside resources  I am doing everything by myself ” she said. “It’s a huge  huge struggle.” Now  she’s waiting for her first unemployment check  which is a fraction of what she made before. She said the $1 200 stimulus check from the government will also do little to help her situation. “If you are releasing it in the month of April and I pay my bills for May where does that leave me for June  July  August?” Johnson said. “We’re at a standstill because we don’t know when the city will open back up.” Jobless claims  laid-off workers’ applications for unemployment insurance payments  have never risen this high so fast. The losses have wiped out all the job gains made since the end of the last recession. Lenny Kiefer  the deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac whose dramatic animated charts of the weekly numbers have gone viral on Twitter  described the latest losses as “off the charts both figuratively and literally”. Delays in processing applications have boosted the weekly totals in recent weeks but economists believe the unprecedented wave of claims is near its peak. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander said the labor market remained “under severe strain” but said that “states that imposed lockdowns relatively early are seeing claims activity improve somewhat.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058581aec0abe9e02942ad573eab2a3962b7a11a/307_0_5056_3037/master/5056.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a6aef1110428d2089793d90211a7352 https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/EWSjeA1X0AsHtcZ.jpg https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=US+unemployment+and+employment+statistics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUS+work+%26+careers%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CUS+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/commercial-property-landlords-banned-from-demanding-rent-arrears,business, Commercial property landlords banned from demanding rent arrears, Temporary ban intended to protect UK retailers and other firms from ‘aggressive rent collection’ during coronavirus crisis, Landlords are prohibited by the government until 30 June from sending their tenants statutory demands  a formal request for payment or winding-up petitions - a legal notice usually sent by a creditor to request that the courts close a company that owes it money. The business secretary  Alok Sharma  said most landlords and tenants had been working together well  but he criticised some landlords for putting tenants under pressure to pay  urging them to show “forbearance”. The government has previously allowed commercial tenants to delay rental payments for three months without fear of eviction. The extended measures will prevent landlords from using commercial rent arrears recovery  or sending in bailiffs  unless they are owed 90 days of unpaid rent. High-street retailers and other companies are being asked to “pay what they can” to their landlords. Landlords believe certain tenants are exploiting the situation by refusing to pay rent and have begun to take legal action to recoup money owed. The fashion and homeware retailer Matalan was issued with a winding-up petition by a landlord this month for failing to pay rent it owed. The retailer  founded by the billionaire John Hargreaves  has since settled with the landlord. The indebted shopping centre owner Intu Properties threatened some of its tenants with a statutory demand at the end of March  and said it had “neither the desire or financial capacity to bankroll global  well-capitalised brands who have just decided they don’t want to pay their rent.” Retailers and hospitality companies  many of whom have not had any revenue for several weeks  had been calling on the government to do more to protect firms. The measures will provide firms with some “breathing room”  said Kate Nicholls  chief executive of UK Hospitality  which represents the cafe and restaurant business. Nicholls said companies would find a way to work with their landlords  but added: “If social distancing measures are to be in place for some time  as we now believe they will  this measure may need to be extended to ensure that businesses can survive.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2deb5d281525a4caad56e7a8544850e022de78ee/0_300_5397_3238/master/5397.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=427f8fec5c563e1c84d449eb70f12314 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Commercial+property%2CRetail+industry%2CBusiness%2CReal+estate%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
24/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/what-will-coronavirus-mean-for-the-british-economy,world, What will coronavirus mean for the British economy?, As the UK faces what may be its worst ever recession  we begin a monthly series exploring the financial shock to business and living standards, Boris Johnson’s government launched unprecedented restrictions on 23 March  telling the British public that they must stay at home and bringing life as the nation knew it to an abrupt halt. Thousands of lives have been lost to Covid-19  while millions of jobs are at risk with the economy effectively in deep freeze. Pubs and restaurants remain shut  high streets are empty  and planes are grounded. As the global health emergency prompts an economic crash unparalleled since at least the Great Depression of the 1930s  the Guardian is launching a monthly Covid-19 crisis watch to track the financial shock facing households and businesses. One month in to tough government controls  early snapshots of business activity  transport usage and the numbers of people signing up to claim universal credit paint a picture of an economy grinding to a halt  as the urgent challenge to save lives is made paramount. Over the coming months  the Guardian will attempt to map out the damage to jobs  companies and living standards by following the latest economic developments on a monthly basis  tracking indicators such as inflation  unemployment  GDP and retail sales  as well as the FTSE 100 and house prices. The Guardian’s Covid crisis watch will also consider how the UK is faring compared with other countries. At this stage  much of the official economic data has yet to catch up with events  as government analysts and statisticians require weeks to gather enough data to make a judgment. However  the impact of lockdown is clear in several rapid indicators  including travel  online restaurant bookings  cinema ticket sales  travel and retail footfall  which has plunged by 85%  according to Google location data. Highlighting the effectiveness of the lockdown measures  government figures showed transport use down by around 60% or more since February  with rail journeys and trips on the London Underground down by more than 95%. Road traffic levels have also slumped to 1950s levels. Fewer vehicles on the streets and planes in the air  alongside sharp reductions in industrial output  have come as a boon for the environment. Early figures suggest pollution levels have dropped by up to half in London and several other big cities. Among the most rapidly available barometers of economic stress  financial markets around the world have been plunged into turmoil  with the biggest collapse in share prices since Black Monday in 1987. The price of oil has crashed on global markets as demand for crude crumbles  with factories closed or running reduced hours  while international travel is grounded. Falling oil prices have been exacerbated by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. In the US  oil prices turned negative for the first time ever on Monday as producers paid buyers to take barrels of oil off their hands. Ahead of what is expected to be the deepest global recession in peacetime  closely watched surveys of business activity suggested service sector output  manufacturing and construction projects had slipped into reverse  with the monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) barometer falling by the biggest margin since records began more than two decades ago. In a glimmer of hope for the economy  some firms are starting to eye a return to work  including Jaguar Land Rover  B&Q and Taylor Wimpey. Economic activity has collapsed around the world at the onset of an unprecedented synchronised downturn  little more than a decade after commentators believed the world had witnessed a once-in-a-generation recession with the 2008 financial crisis. The Guardian will track the government’s unprecedented emergency financial support measures for firms and individuals  and the impact they will have on the public finances. In response to the coronavirus crisis  ministers have stepped in to cushion the economic fallout and save as many jobs and businesses as possible. Despite a price tag spiralling into the billions  with costs rising the longer lockdown continues  significant holes in the safety net still remain  made worse by a decade of austerity before the coronavirus struck. Launching a job retention scheme to pay 80% of the wages of workers up to £2 500 each per month on Monday  the government has received applications for furlough payments from more than 387 000 firms to pay more than 2.8 million people  an intervention that has cost at least £2bn so far. Although a similar scheme to compensate the country’s 5 million self-employed workers is planned  it will take until June to set up  and millions will receive no support under the current plans. The government has promised to back more than £300bn of loans to businesses  with larger firms able to access finance from the Bank of England and smaller firms able to borrow using Treasury-guaranteed loans from high street banks. The central bank has also cut interest rates to the lowest levels in history  0.1%  and pumped £200bn more into its quantitative easing bond-buying programme to lower borrowing costs for households and businesses. Despite hopes that the interventions would help companies to bridge a black hole in sales during the lockdown  many firms are struggling to access support and rising numbers of people are losing their jobs. As rising numbers of people find themselves without a job and facing the threat of financial hardship  around 1.5 million people have signed up to apply for universal credit payments. Almost one in four adults have already suffered a financial hit as the crisis unfolds  according to the Office for National Statistics. As demand for goods and services evaporates  shoppers stay away from the high street and the global oil price plummets  inflation has started to tumble. However  prices of some goods in high demand have spiralled in recent weeks after shoppers scrambled to stockpile long-life food and sanitary products. UK growth The Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the coronavirus crisis could cause a 35% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) this spring. The damage to jobs and growth depends on the length of lockdown measures  with a bigger impact the longer tough controls last. If lockdown lasts for three months  GDP could crash by around 13% for 2020 as a whole. Unemployment More than 2 million people could lose their jobs by June  according to the OBR. But some analysts expect a bigger impact. David Blanchflower  a former Bank of England rate-setter  has warned that job losses could surpass the Great Depression by rising to more than 6 million people  around 21% of the workforce. Public finances Britain’s budget deficit  the gap between public spending and income from taxes  is expected to surge to the highest levels since the second world war  surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis. As spending rises to fund emergency support measures and the economy crashes  the OBR said the deficit could hit £273bn this year  or around 14% of GDP. World economy The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression. It said world GDP could fall by 3% this year  compared with the 3.3% growth it forecast for 2020 just three months ago. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf13da788e592c19ddd4ee850f99e4424c581f25/0_335_5896_3543/master/5896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7f3db16a9d38033b81e1aac3a213a8 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CInflation%2CUK+news%2CUK+unemployment+and+employment+statistics%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CRetail+industry%2CLondon%2CTransport%2CStock+markets%2COil%2CBank+of+England%2CTax+and+spending https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/pollutionwatch-why-has-particle-pollution-increased-under-lockdown,environment, Pollutionwatch: why has particle pollution increased under lockdown?, Air pollution from traffic has dropped but particles also come from gas heating and agriculture, At the end of March  and again around Easter  UK particle pollution reached its greatest concentrations for the year so far. This peaked across south-east England on 9 April  at eight on the 10-point UK air quality index. Values between four and six were measured over most of England and Wales. Spring smogs happen most years and typically result in air pollution at index eight to 10. So  the lockdown may have averted the worst impacts but why are we having any air pollution at all? Chemical analysis by King’s College London reveals that the particles came from traffic and industry  gas heating and agriculture. The annual start to the agriculture cycle makes spring the most polluted time of year in western Europe. A global study showed that halving ammonia from farming could reduce the early deaths from air pollution in Europe by around 20%. This could be done by improving fertiliser spreading (also saving farmers money)  changing animal feeds and better manure and slurry storage. Home wood burning was measured during the March episode but had less impact in the warmer weather around Easter. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c75a9588e8db8704577bf09694d6ca327d7681/0_127_5572_3344/master/5572.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2765f206eefa7f3fec5c328e044ee525 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Pollution%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CEnvironment%2CAir+pollution https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19,world, Ethnic minorities dying of Covid-19 at higher rate  analysis shows, Exclusive: ministers urged to recognise racial inequality and race are risk factors for disease, The revelation that people from minority groups appear to be over-represented among the coronavirus deaths  by as much as 27%  “confirmed the worst fears” of campaigners who said there was now no question of an excessive toll. The Guardian analysis found that of 12 593 patients who died in hospital up to 19 April  19% were Black  Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) even though these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. And the analysis revealed that three London boroughs with high BAME populations - Harrow  Brent and Barnet – were also among the five local authorities with the highest death rates in hospitals and the community. The findings confirm suspicions raised by local reports  hospitalisation rates and evidence from other countries  that minority groups face the greatest risk. And they show for the first time that areas with high ethnic minority populations in England and Wales tend to have higher mortality rates. While it is is not yet clear why communities with proportionally higher number of BAME inhabitants appear to be dying at higher rates  one expert on public and ethnic health said that social deprivation was the strongest indicator for mortality due to an increased underlying burden of disease. “There have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out ” said Wasim Hanif  professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham. He added: “Deaths happen in relation to complications related to diabetes all the time  as with cardiovascular diseases and cancers  but they have never hit the headlines and that’s the effect we’re seeing now.” The findings  which run alongside separate concerns about the death rate among BAME healthcare workers  are based on two data sets and two batches of analysis. One was from the NHS and covered deaths in English hospitals up to 19 April. The findings are based on new figures from the Office or National Statistics breaking down deaths by local authority up to 3 April  enabling the matching of deaths to data on pollution  age  deprivation  population density and BAME populations in England and Wales for the first time. A high proportion of BAME residents was found to be the strongest predictor of a high Covid-19 death rate. The analysis shows that for every 10% increase in ethnic minority residents there were 2.9 more Covid-19 deaths per 100 000 people. The Guardian took into account the influence of other factors including population density and age  which explained only part of the correlation between ethnicity and death rates. Dr Zubaida Haque  deputy director of the Runnymede Trust  said: “The Guardian’s analysis confirm our worst fears. We’re already aware that people of colour are much more likely to be critically ill with Covid-19 than their white counterparts  but we now know that BAME people are also much more at risk of mortality with Covid-19. Covid-19 is throwing into sharp relief existing racial inequalities.” She added that the government had to recognise that race and racial inequalities were a risk factor in Covid-19 and that it should address the disproportionate rates of poverty  insecure and low-paid labour  which was often also undertaken by keyworkers  plus poorer conditions and overcrowded housing – all of which were putting ethnic minorities much more at risk of Covid-19 infection. “There’s no question any more about whether BAME people are bearing the brunt of Covid-19; they clearly are. The question is whether the government view these racial inequalities as a serious enough problem to do something about it.” The stark picture painted by the research comes as health authorities come under increasing pressure to publish the data held on the deaths of BAME patients from Covid-19  amid warnings that a failure to do so could be putting lives at risk. After a public outcry the government is beginning to release official statistics on ethnicity. On Monday NHS England released a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by ethnic minorities for the first time. Based on that and the information provided for local authorities  it emerged that the London boroughs of Harrow and Brent had had the highest death rates  of about 37 and 32 deaths per 100 000 residents respectively. In Harrow 58% of residents are from ethnic minority backgrounds   while in Brent the figure is 64%. South Lakeland  in Cumbria  had the next highest mortality rate  with 29 deaths per 100 000. It is a largely white  rural area and is something of an outlier. Dawn Butler  the Labour MP for Brent Central  described the Guardian’s findings as deeply concerning  adding: “It’s a particularly emotional time because every every day we are speaking to families who have lost loved ones or who have loved ones in hospital and cannot go to see them. “It’s taking a serious toll in a community where you also have also have inter generational living with groups of families – grandchildren  parents and children – all living the one household.” Apart from South Lakeland and Hertsmere – which is just outside London and borders Harrow and Barnet – the 10 areas with the highest mortality rates were all urban  and seven had higher than average BAME populations. Because deaths by ethnicity are not compared to the local population  further research is required to identify to what degree minority deaths are over-represented. London and the West Midlands accounted for 46% of deaths in the dataset. In London two in five people are from an ethnic minority background  while in the West Midlands that proportion is one fifth. The analysis is based on the first 5 186 Covid-19 deaths recorded on death certificates up until 3 April and reflects fatalities in hospitals and in the community. As the data is continually updated some areas in the data have low deaths counts and the findings may change as more deaths are registered. The lack of any further detail about what shaped the government’s review was attacked by the shadow equalities minister  Marsha de Cordova  who called for an independent investigation into the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities  to address health  economic and social inequalities. She said: “It is disappointing the government has yet to commit to this and has failed to share details of its work to date. This lack of transparency and action is risking lives. NHS and Public Health England must urgently publish the data they hold  and the government must start tackling the underlying socio-economic inequalities so they are not exacerbated over the next few months.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Any death from this disease is a tragedy and we are working incredibly hard  day and night  to protect the nation’s public health.” Additional reporting: Ben Quinn • This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to remove a term which does not comply with our style guide. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45aa18ef24426ad561b345f765a5eb8ca0e9b407/0_201_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d5e6d62efa89251819366b4609865d8e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CRace%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CInequality%2CPopulation%2COffice+for+National+Statistics%2CMedical+research https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/hancocks-department-warned-no-10-not-to-publicise-ppe-shipment,politics, Hancock's department 'warned No 10' not to publicise PPE shipment, Exclusive: Department of Health ‘strongly advised’ Robert Jenrick not to make promise but was overruled  sources say, In a sign of deepening tensions between the Department of Health and Downing Street  the source said that Hancock’s Cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick was “strongly advised” not to mention the consignment at the government’s coronavirus media briefing last Saturday. Instead  the housing  communities and local government secretary – with No 10’s approval – went ahead and promised that it would arrive the next day and contain 83 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE)  including 400 000 of the full-length surgical gowns that are in critically short supply in the NHS. Its non-arrival on Sunday led hospital bosses to go public for the first time with their “intense frustration and exasperation” with ministers over botched deliveries of PPE. The disclosures – strongly denied by a source close to Hancock who called them “categorically not true and a fabrication” - come amid what appear to be growing difficulties at the heart of government over who is to blame for the difficulties Boris Johnson’s administration is facing over its handling of the Coronavirus crisis  especially the lack of both testing and PPE for NHS staff. Hancock was subject to a public attack in a front-page story in Tuesday’s Daily Telegraph  quoting government insiders  over his struggle to deliver the 100 000 tests for Coronavirus a day by the end of the month that he promised in early April. An unnamed person referred to as an insider who is close to Downing Street aides was quoted as calling the target “arbitrary”  and adding: “There is a faint irrationality behind it  just because there was a clamour for mass testing. Hancock’s 100 000 target was a response to a criticism in the media and he decided to crank out tests regardless. “He’s not had a good crisis. The prime minister will say he has confidence in him but it doesn’t feel like that. He set out to buy time by setting this target and it threatens to come back to bite him. The 100 000 figure was Hancock’s idea  but he made that figure up.” On Wednesday  the DHSC source said that Downing Street had been urged not to refer to the cargo before Saturday’s briefing. “We strongly advised Robert Jenrick against doing this [mentioning the Turkey shipment at the government press conference last Saturday] but he and No 10 overruled us ” the source said. “The advice we gave as a department was that we shouldn’t mention individual orders of PPE. But for whatever reason it wasn’t followed.” But another cabinet source said it was not right to say “it was just Matt that was warning about this”. “Lots of people were clear that we shouldn’t be talking about any shipments before they’ve arrived. Everyone in government is normally wary of this and I don’t know why it didn’t happen this time ” he said. The government has faced severe criticism this week over its handling of deliveries of foreign-sourced PPE to the UK. The promised arrival of 400 000 gowns urgently needed by frontline staff turning into a saga which dragged on into Wednesday  when one of three RAF planes that had been scheduled to bring the shipment back finally touched down in the UK. The plane had been dispatched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire  where two other aircraft have been on standby to pick up further supplies from Turkey since late on 20 April. The Department of Health and Social Care was blamed for failing to secure the necessary export approvals from Turkey after placing the order  but health sources said on 22 April that there were other reasons for the delay. The planes remain on standby at RAF Brize Norton and may fly to Istanbul imminently if there is enough equipment waiting to make the journey worthwhile. “We’ve been told there is another delivery at the airport now  but we are not yet sure if there’s enough to justify a flight ” a defence source said. There have been repeated ministerial assurances that the cargo would imminently arrive in the UK since Saturday when Jenrick first referred to it. His initial announcement was made even though necessary clearances had not been sought. On Sunday  Gavin Williamson  the education secretary  said he hoped the shipment would arrive the next day. That promise was tentatively repeated by Oliver Dowden  the culture secretary  on Monday morning after NHS leaders intervened. “I don’t want to start making more and more promises  but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered ” Dowden said. On Tuesday  the government finally adopted a more cautious tone. Simon Clarke  the local government minister  said the consignment would be in the UK “in the next few days”. The Whitehall source said: “We have been telling people off across government against doing this [talking about expected deliveries before they arrive]. We just need to stop talking about them until they arrive in the country. It’s just not helpful for the government for us to be talking about it. “The advice that we gave as a department was that we shouldn’t mention individual orders of PPE [because] supply chains are extremely unreliable. When orders fall through or are delayed  for whatever reason  it’s not good for anyone. Nobody in the NHS appreciates being told that we have got X tonnes of PPE turning up but it then not arriving.” The source added that Hancock has made clear to No 10 and other government departments that: “We shouldn’t be making promises that can’t be delivered on an exact date when we don’t know what will arrive or when. We’re just trying to exercise caution in the way we talk about supplies.” In the wake of last Sunday’s non-arrival from Turkey  NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation  which both represent hospital trusts in England  made clear that they wanted ministers to stop talking about PPE orders until they actually arrived and had been checked to ensure that they contain what had been ordered. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb45462d96d787b659557855e296252829b3d517/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5fc99cff15d9e9811e350712efed48d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Matt+Hancock%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/earth-day-greta-thunberg-calls-for-new-path-after-pandemic,environment, Earth Day: Greta Thunberg calls for 'new path' after pandemic, Climate activist says Covid-19 outbreak shows change can happen when we listen to scientists, The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists. She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis. “Whether we like it or not  the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward ” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. “If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing  it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks  it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.” The teenage campaigner  who initiated the global school strike movement  was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström  the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute. He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis ” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.” The lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry  which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering  provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns  research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy. The key lesson from the pandemic  they said  was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings. “We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system ” Rockström said. “Around the world  people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate  we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this  but not by bouncing back to the old world.” He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities. Neither speaker mentioned the US president  Donald Trump  Brazil’s president  Jair Bolsonaro  or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers. “During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen ” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.” Elsewhere  the UN secretary general  António Guterres  marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war  though he said the environmental emergency was deeper. He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean  green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system  and international cooperation. A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China  Germany  France  India  Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets. “We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis ” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc9acf4afc60d0c2aba0de88b05b0896adb897b/0_185_5568_3343/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4c9a034b8f3875d9fc7f25114dc2a61 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78cf84edd6975568fda689a5bb466009d18bf00/0_246_7360_4419/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd563ae0a5f6157a5acd033c54df93db https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0ecde26645882dc8457c86ad576e2da6682777b/0_105_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5ca43f1d131d11d245c3b247f051902 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fd9c7d132a208ae4f7469dec8b8eccec533b44/0_374_5611_3367/master/5611.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6ed798b3e67a53b5ca44b3fd645e1b8 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9084492f6d55c240bc799291cd43350ae38ec3a5/0_0_638_383/master/638.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72ddddef67e94bc3c268f558d5dead6f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e564f7f6c2aad7f046e39b8786b1ab8ee324fd/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b95ddef56e6e0a80c3385ef9ac55016c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Climate+change%2CEnvironment%2CClimate+change%2CScience%2CGreta+Thunberg%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CDeforestation%2CFossil+fuels%2CWildlife%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/fears-of-rise-in-uk-terrorism-recruits-after-anti-radicalisation-referrals-collapse-coronavirus,uk-news, Fears of rise in UK terrorist recruits as anti-radicalisation referrals collapse, Prevent referrals thought to be 50% down as far-right and Islamist groups exploit vulnerable in lockdown, The Guardian understands referrals to Prevent are down by more than 50% since the lockdown started on 23 March  according to official figures yet to be made public. Counter-terrorism officials fear a crucial defence is being weakened with young people spending more time online alone and unsupervised since schools and colleges closed. Ch Supt Nik Adams  the national coordinator for Prevent  said: “What concerns me greatly is that the decline in the number of referrals doesn’t mean that there are fewer people that need our help  but that fewer people are able to access the support they need. “Schools  mental health workers and other public services provide vital support and protection to young and vulnerable people  and the combination of those services being impacted by Covid-19 and the fact people are spending more time online means a small number of vulnerable people are at greater risk of being drawn towards terrorist activity.” One major cause of the sharp drop in referrals is that those in the community who usually spot signs of concern  such as youth workers and teachers  are no longer meeting people. The scheme relies on such referrals. The fall in referrals is believed to be the largest ever in the more than a decade Prevent has been running. Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer  assistant commissioner Neil Basu  has said Prevent is the most important strand of the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy to thwart mass casualty attacks by those radicalised by both jihadists and the extreme right wing. Both ideologies have been trying to exploit the crisis in recent weeks. Isis propaganda channels have called for followers in the UK to stage attacks because  they say  the west is weak and diverted by the pandemic. It has said that the crisis could allow Isis supporters to “overwhelm” the west. Isis has also used one of its propaganda channels to tell supporters to stay away from countries affected by coronavirus  and those in them to stay put. The extreme right is trying to exploit the crisis by whipping up false claims Muslims are breaking the lockdown more than other groups and spreading the disease. In fake social media postings they have used old photos of worshippers going to mosques and falsely claiming they date from after the lockdown. In reality  every mosque in the UK is closed with Muslims suffering a high death toll from the virus. Far-right groups have tried to exploit false claims about a link between 5G technology and coronavirus  to draw people into its chat groups where they can then be groomed. In 2019 a total of six terrorist plots were thwarted by British counter-terrorism police and MI5 investigators. Three were triggered by Islamist ideology and three by extreme rightwing ideology. The vast majority of work to thwart terrorist attacks involves violent Islamist extremists. The extreme right wing poses a smaller  but growing  threat. In the last year the overall threat of terrorist attacks has lessened but senior officers are very concerned by the big drop in Prevent referrals. In recent years terrorists have seen the internet as a prime way of grooming vulnerable people. The coronavirus lockdown provides fresh – and police fear – enhanced opportunities. Adams said: “Isolation may exacerbate grievances that make people more vulnerable to radicalisation – such as financial insecurity or social alienation. “The extremists and radicalisers know this and  as ever  will look to exploit any opportunity to lead those people into harm  often using topical issues as hooks to lure them in.” In November 2019 the UK terrorism threat was reduced from severe  meaning an attack is assessed as highly likely  to substantial  meaning an atrocity is likely  for the first time in five years. The move was followed within three months by two terrorist attacks in London  at London Bridge and Streatham. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/310a6f3af3f02b6deff2c55c9bbd30ae729890c4/1_260_3868_2323/master/3868.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44307505a26b1ad38a3b23a60801979b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ac98d5da0a85082b7080fdfc7e9489abaeae1a/0_32_4093_2456/master/4093.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e6435c5771ca2adacdd233e19db59d0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab62c6f8d7667c76c6b8b999f646763190e82c2/0_140_4454_2672/master/4454.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4d249748a572e3f5037c715072a29dbe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a529002321866499af612a910e24257d1157d5d/93_0_1263_758/master/1263.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53889a2343a806fbff347837c0f7e142 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a3f6a5e6176357b367315d9df8419f6cce7938/0_370_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b28cd2d35e382fd63917ba0a6584d29 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+security+and+counter-terrorism%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CIslamic+State%2CFar+right https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/couple-at-sea-for-a-month-reveal-shock-at-scale-of-coronavirus-pandemic,world, Couple at sea for a month reveal shock at scale of coronavirus pandemic, Elena Manighetti  from Lombardy  and Ryan Osborne told families not to contact them with bad news during Atlantic crossing, They left Lanzarote on the 3 000-nautical-mile journey on 28 February  with the latest they’d heard being that deaths from Covid-19 were slowing. On 25 March  as they reached the Caribbean island of Bequia  after 25 days of no internet access  they switched on their phones. “We bought some data and I remember Ryan reading out the news and our jaws just dropped ” said Elena. “It was hard to grasp the scale of it at first ” said Ryan. “If you were waking up from a coma now  I think it would be hard to imagine the scale of what had unfolded.” Elena is from Lombardy in northern Italy  one of the regions most affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “If you don’t read the news for a month and then you turn on your phone it’s not like there’s a news feed that tells you exactly what has happened every day  so I could only really access the previous week’s news ” she said. “It was about three days [after we arrived] that Ryan found a 10-day old article in the New York Times that said my home town [of Bergamo] was the worst-hit in the world. I had had absolutely no idea. I called my dad and he said: ‘Oh you found out. Don’t panic. It’s all right’. “The news only truly sank in when we saw the pictures of the military trucks in front of the cemetery in my hometown because they had run out of space and coffins. That was the most shocking moment.” The couple  both in their early thirties  have been living on a sailing boat since 2017  documenting their lives on their YouTube channel. Unable to afford to buy a house where they were living in Manchester  they decided to buy a small boat and explore the world on a tiny budget  making a living from bits of freelance copywriting and graphic design work on their laptops. The long journey across the Atlantic was a big challenge  for which the couple had done a lot of preparation. During the crossing the only means of communication they had was a satellite device capable of receiving 160 character messages  which they asked their family and friends not to use to send them bad news. “It’s quite a common thing for sailors not to want bad news when they are on an ocean crossing because there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it ” said Elena. “All you can do is cry  scream  worry  but you can’t turn around because the wind is behind you and is very strong.” They received a sign that something was seriously wrong as they approached the Caribbean. “We were about two days away when someone sent us a list of all the islands that had closed their borders  and we started to get worried that  by the time arrived  we wouldn’t have anywhere to go ” said Ryan. “We thought they were just being especially careful [about coronavirus] because most of the islands don’t really have healthcare infrastructure ” said Elena. “We thought it was all a preventative measure rather than a containment measure.” The pair are now safely anchored in Bequia  an island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  on which there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus. “It’s a very surreal experience landing in a place where everything feels almost normal  while the news tells you that the world is shut down ” said Elena. “We’re torn between these two realities. We are in this amazing place – we are super lucky and super grateful – while in the meantime people are dying and are in hospital.” All the couple can do for now is – like many in their home countries – wait for the pandemic to pass. “We are just going to sit tight ” said Ryan. “And hope that by the winter and the end of hurricane season  the borders will be back open and we can carry on exploring”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cadfc113615849a9bc397b769c06ef7cb287ac27/505_228_3370_2022/master/3370.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=511a4c0f0654a4d563e3b3782f8889cb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3132a1967104175381d5c344711fde3c65a4c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05743f6cbbd64ca8924d42a70aa0e0dc https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CScience%2CInfectious+diseases%2CSailing https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/ryanair-boss-says-airline-wont-fly-with-idiotic-social-distancing-rules,business, Ryanair boss says airline won't fly with 'idiotic' social distancing rules, Michael O’Leary says business model will be in tatters if he is forced to leave middle seats empty, The boss of the no-frills carrier  which has thrived by packing its flights as full as possible with passengers lured by low prices  has previously said that blocking out the space in between seats is “nonsense” that would have no beneficial effect. He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday  saying that if governments insisted on social distancing measures  then Ryanair’s business model would be in tatters and the carrier would not fly. O’Leary said that Ryanair had already told the Irish government that if it imposes the restriction  then “either the government pays for the middle seat or we won’t fly”. The Dublin-based carrier’s business model relies on flying as frequently as possible  stripping out costs and running an extremely high “load factor”  the aviation industry term for how full planes are. “We can’t make money on 66% load factors ” he said. “Even if you do that  the middle seat doesn’t deliver any social distancing  so it’s kind of an idiotic idea that doesn’t achieve anything anyway ” he added  in an interview with the Financial Times. The global airline industry’s trade body  Iata  has predicted huge ramifications for airlines as a result of Covid-19  with lost revenues this year set to hit $314bn (£255bn). Iata said earlier this week that any rules designed to minimise contagion in the skies would temporarily put an end to the cheap air travel model pioneered by Ryanair  forcing carriers to raise prices by 50% or go bust. Ryanair’s no-frills rival easyJet has said it expects socially distanced flights to be possible in the short term  given that demand for air travel is likely to be subdued in any case  even after lockdown restrictions ease off. O’Leary said European airlines should instead take their cue from Asia and impose different safety measures  such as forcing passengers to wear masks or checking their temperature at the airport. Ryanair flew more than 152 million people last year  putting it at the top of the league table of European airlines  a position that gives O’Leary a particularly influential voice in the industry. He sounded a more upbeat tone than some of his rivals  predicting a return to normal passenger numbers by summer 2021  provided a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed. He said the airline would be able to pick up business from rivals that collapse as a result of the pandemic  which has already forced Virgin Australia to file for bankruptcy and left Ryanair’s European rival Norwegian Air fighting for its survival. Airlines including Ryanair have faced criticism for dragging their feet on giving refunds for cancelled flights  as they look to conserve cash during the pandemic. Some of the industry’s biggest players are also trying to convince governments to bail them out  after air travel all but ceased. • This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to clarify that the seats being blocked out would be those between the window seats and aisle seats. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be8b5dcf6d7ad77ca4dfb347ee6f6ab8d9c352e/0_139_5154_3092/master/5154.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9dab827969f00007255c1e0c42918a65 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ryanair%2CMichael+O%27Leary%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAirline+industry%2CInfectious+diseases%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty,world, UK will need social distancing until at least end of year  says Whitty, Government’s chief medical officer says return to normal in short term is ‘wholly unrealistic’, Prof Chris Whitty  the UK’s most senior medic  said it was important to be realistic that “highly disruptive” social distancing would need to be in place for “really quite a long period of time”. He said there was only an “incredibly small” chance of a vaccine or treatments being ready for use this year  and social distancing would have to stay in place to suppress outbreaks until then. His stark assessment dampened hopes that the lockdown would be largely removed when it is reviewed in just over a fortnight. “We have to be very realistic ” he said. “If people are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone  that is a wholly unrealistic expectation. “We are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time  the question is what is the best package and this is what we’re trying to work out. “If you release more on one area  you have to keep on board more of another area so there’s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider.” In other developments: Earlier  Hancock had fuelled hope of the lockdown ending soon by telling the House of Commons the UK was “at the peak” of the virus. Dominic Raab  who is deputising for the prime minister  sounded a slightly more cautious note than Hancock at the daily No 10 press conference  saying “we are coming through the peak” but the UK is “not out the other end yet”. Conservative MPs are growing increasingly fractious about the effects of the lockdown on business and held a conference call of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories on Wednesday where many expressed a desire to see it lifted as soon as possible in early May. However  speaking alongside Raab  Whitty made clear that it would be a long downward slope out of the current peak in terms of falling infections and deaths. He refused to be drawn on how the UK could begin to ease the lockdown but said a combination of measures could make sure the rate of transmission – known as R – is kept below 1. This means each case spreads the virus to fewer than one other person. “In the long run  the exit from this is going to be one of two things  ideally ” he said. “A vaccine  and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or  and/or  highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it  or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people. “Until we have those – and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small  and I think we should be realistic about that – we’re going to have to rely on other social measures  which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment. “But until that point  that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it’s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that.” Hancock has begun to emphasise that the formula of “test  trace and isolate” would be key to exiting the lockdown and suppressing new outbreaks. “We are ramping up our testing capacity and our capacity for contact tracing in a matter of weeks ” he told the House of Commons. However  the UK is still a very long way off Hancock’s target of 100 000 tests a day by the end of next week. The latest government figures showed less than half the testing capacity was used in the 24 hours up to 9am on Tuesday  with capacity at 41 398 and only 18 206 tests carried out. Whitty also stressed that testing would have to be combined with other social distancing measures. The government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is still considering whether the use of non-medical face masks in some public places could be recommended  despite previous guidance that they are not effective. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CChris+Whitty%2CMatt+Hancock%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/raab-is-tried-and-found-wanting-by-a-masterful-starmer,politics, Raab is tried and found wanting by a masterful Starmer, Starmer rehearses for the inevitable inquiry into coronavirus failings while Hancock increases his number of pillars  even if not tests, Starmer is never going to set the world alight with grand gestures or the passion of his oratory. But what he does bring to the job is intelligence and a forensic attention to detail. He doesn’t just read his six prepared questions  he listens to the answers and adapts his follow-ups accordingly. Neither does he raise his voice or get rattled: rather he adapts his tone to the occasion. And he was near enough note perfect. After a brief reassurance that he would be seeking to support the government wherever possible during the coronavirus emergency  Starmer got to the heart of most of the country’s concerns. The health secretary had promised 100 000 tests a day by the end of the month and as of yesterday had managed just 18 000. How on earth did the government imagine it was going to reach its own target? Filling in for the absent Boris Johnson  Dominic Raab made the mistake of imagining he could go toe-to-toe with Starmer. Unfortunately the beta blockers he had taken to make him appear even-tempered had rather dulled his mind. We have the capacity to do 40 000 tests  Dom replied  and in any case the UK was going to ramp up its testing regime exponentially in the next eight days. If true  that would be remarkable  as Raab would have committed the government to a target of more like 400 000 tests a day. “I didn’t need correcting ” Starmer observed  nearly managing to keep the irritation out of his voice. Matt Hancock had promised 100 000 tests  not the capacity to do 100 000 tests. So the government was well behind its own targets. There was no point in setting up testing centres in places where NHS and care workers who suspected they were ill could not get to without travelling on public transport  risking infecting other people. Starmer then asked if Raab could give the exact number of NHS staff and care workers who had died in the pandemic so far. He couldn’t. But then neither could Helen Whately  the social care minister who is actually paid to know these things  in yet another disastrous media round earlier in the morning. Quite why No 10 insists on repeatedly sending out ministers whose only discernible ability is to know nothing about anything is one of the least investigated side-effects of the pandemic. “I’m putting you on notice that I’ll be asking the same question next week ” said Starmer. “Hopefully you will be able to answer it by then.” I wouldn’t count on it. Instead  Raab wittered on about how brilliantly the government had been doing  given the circumstances. You’d hate to think what the death rates would have been if the government hadn’t been quite so brilliant  given we are on target to overtake the Italians and the Spanish. Starmer merely ended with a warning. The UK had been slow to react in almost every respect. He made it sound like the opening address for the prosecution in the judge-led public inquiry that will inevitably follow when the pandemic is over. Raab had good reason to look worried. Most of the rest of PMQs took place with MPs dialling in remotely. And given that it was only the first day  the technology worked more or less OK  with only David Mundell failing to connect. As for the others  the chamber was treated to eight large TV screens of Ian Blackford  Peter Bone and Barry Gardiner. Which felt like seven too many. One of most MPs is usually more than enough. Matt Hancock appeared rather more at ease with himself during the statement that followed than he had at the No 10 press briefing the day before. Maybe he’s had time to reflect on the fact Dominic Cummings has lined him up as the government’s fall guy and has concluded he’s better off out of such a poisonous atmosphere. Que sera  sera. Even so  his statement wasn’t without its oddities. Most notably when he said he was going to repeat his five pillars. Only to unexpectedly add a sixth. It wasn’t clear if this sixth was to replace one of the others that had since crumbled  or whether it was genuinely a new addition. On the whole  ministers like to keep things in fives as they think that makes them look in control. Six of anything is a symptom of woolly thinking. Though maybe he was just building up to seven pillars of wisdom in time for Ramadan. The official advice is for those over 70 to continue to self-isolate at home  but nothing was going to stop Jeremy Corbyn from appearing in person. Even though he didn’t have anything to add that couldn’t have been said remotely. Still  good to know that Rebel  Rebel can still stick it to the Man. What we didn’t find out though  was why the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office had suddenly remembered that the evidence he had given to the select committee the previous day about the UK’s decision not to join an EU procurement scheme had actually been completely wrong. You could almost feel Classic Dom’s gun in Sir Simon McDonald’s back as he wrote that retraction. Still  come the inevitable reckoning  the one thing we can guarantee is there won’t be a show trial. With Starmer as leader of the opposition  any trial will be the genuine article. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27f5861f20e40669e7aae83125e90f08cc9289fc/20_0_3460_2076/master/3460.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=367f143273f9f695ce90393ebb5dfa06 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Keir+Starmer%2CDominic+Raab%2CPMQs%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CMatt+Hancock%2CUK+news%2CHouse+of+Commons https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/revealed-private-firm-running-uk-ppe-stockpile-was-sold-in-middle-of-pandemic,world, Revealed: Private firm running UK PPE stockpile was sold in middle of pandemic, Movianto was also involved in legal disputes with firm that built warehouse to store equipmentby Harry Davies, For security reasons  the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK’s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic–size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast  climate-controlled warehouse. However  the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company  Movianto  which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (£107m) by its owner  a large US healthcare group. The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic  months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply  would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto  which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside. The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year  to thwart threats by the developer  Oliver Morley  to “lock the gates” and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock. Morley’s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued  but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm  alleging there was “a much bigger story that needs to be told” about his former tenant  but declined to provide specific details. For its part  Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley’s allegations  pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months. “Movianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations ” the firm said. But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government’s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years  the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile  management of the stock has been passed from a German–owned multinational to an American one. In the coming months the custody of the UK’s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris. A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “The pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.” Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government’s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks  including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  insists the government is rising to the challenge  and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been “one of distribution rather than one of supply”. In addition to procuring new supplies from China  the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile  which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme. That stockpile is made up of around 52 000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated £500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19  the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored  updated and stored in temperature–controlled conditions. The government owns the stock  but outsources its management to private firms. Previously  the contract was held by DHL. Movianto  a subsidiary of the US health company Owens & Minor  won the £55m deal in the summer of 2018. As part of Movianto’s plans  the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime  the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse  also owned by Morley  in Knowsley. Movianto’s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office  documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was “made by executives no longer associated with Movianto”. A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain “a ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event”. In early 2019  Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley’s company  which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley  his tenants became “uncooperative”. “This went on for weeks ” he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation  saying it paid rent “in accordance with the terms of the lease”. Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock  including medicines  was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators  which “kept going on the blink” resulting  he alleges  in “temperature spikes”. A Movianto source said Morley’s account was inaccurate. In a statement  Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of “Morley’s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations”. By his own account  Morley’s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. “It got to the point where I said I’m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.” When that happened  Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse. Movianto said the injunction was required as “a result of Morley’s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto’s operations”. It said Morley’s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by “various court proceedings” that ruled in Movianto’s favour. In July 2019  under the control of administrators  Morley’s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto. Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto – and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January  he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank’s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a £75m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the “borrowed personal wealth” to spend on “South African mining investments  property  cars  a yacht and a jet”. Morley told the Guardian his lifestyle was the result of hard work and “had nothing to do with being a good landlord”. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto  which came to a head in May 2019. As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley  Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm “failed to comply” with the conditions of a £61m loan facility. Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator’s report  the legal dispute “caused delays to the construction works” at the new warehouse  which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes “have had no impact on Movianto’s work in response to Covid-19”. According to a government source  the transfer of the UK’s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019  four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China. The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council  which bought the property for £45m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon  warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left. In the coming months  their employer will switch from Owens & Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group  under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June  with demand for supplies in the UK’s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months. The distribution of that stockpile’s PPE  it seems  may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago  the DHSC announced a new “24/7 military operation” to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network  essentially from scratch ” Hancock said. A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic – the basis of Movianto’s original contract. Movianto was now “supporting” the government’s PPE plan through its contractual obligations  the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were “confidential”. Jeff Jochims  the chief operating officer of Owens & Minor  said: “We look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH  but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0339f3ac7716020b8d134d2da10562f8883867da/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6938c309af6589a316f7757e6c2e04c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26/0_165_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10497aaf2c843507b720ce0272b3bdf0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/uk-government-accused-of-cover-up-over-eu-scheme-to-buy-ppe,politics, UK government accused of cover-up over EU scheme to buy PPE, Matt Hancock denies ‘political decision’ but ministers urged to reveal details, The Labour MP Chris Bryant  who sits on the foreign affairs select committee  said on Wednesday that he “feared the government was involved in a full-on cover-up” over how it came to miss out on four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE)  ventilators and laboratory supplies launched by the EU in late February and March. UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March – after the bulk purchases had been made. Bryant said he feared either Foreign Office ministers or the prime minister decided not to be associated with any EU scheme for political reasons “even though it was patently in the interests of the NHS and its staff to explore every possible avenue to acquire masks  gowns and ventilator equipment  as fast and most effectively as possible”. His intervention came a day after the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary  Sir Simon McDonald  told MPs that ministers had indeed taken a political decision not to join the scheme. After his claims  made to the foreign affairs committee on Tuesday  were later denied by the health secretary  Matt Hancock  McDonald wrote to the committee that night saying his original statement of a political motive was wrong and “owing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join”. However  Bryant  in a view shared by some fellow committee members  senses that in his letter McDonald was limiting his retraction to the advice given to ministers about the EU ventilator scheme  but not to other EU medical product purchase schemes. Bryant has written to the committee chair  Tom Tugendhat  asking him to seek from the Foreign Office details of British representation at EU meetings held on 31 January  4 February  2 March and 13 March “at which EU-wide health security issues arising from coronavirus were discussed and the bulk procurement of masks  gowns  ventilators and other laboratory equipment were discussed”. He is also asking to see the briefing notes after these meetings  and the list of recipients in Whitehall to which any such notes were circulated. Bryant contends that McDonald was being asked by the committee about four rounds of EU procurement schemes launched in February and March  but in his letter to the committee correcting what he told the MPs McDonald appeared only to be referring to the EU ventilator scheme. Bryant then demands to know whether ministers were briefed about the other schemes. Hancock faced further pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given “ample opportunity” to join the EU scheme bulk-buying masks  gowns  gloves and goggles. After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK’s lack of involvement in the EU’s joint procurement of equipment  a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a “political decision” to opt out. The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators  laboratory supplies and PPE. UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because of a communication problem linked to missed emails. The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “The EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings. “The UK was  as all other members of the health security committee meetings  aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate  this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d4405fbe907db8b7bc6b83bec2b1bc65ab8bccc/0_161_4860_2918/master/4860.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b7d435a13010a471ee0eaf32c63b945 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ba858f13ff2e658f40905714d2611ff9e38370/0_16_1564_938/master/1564.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3562f107da657ddb3f7239d40d161c04 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMatt+Hancock%2CChris+Bryant%2CEuropean+Union%2CNHS%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/why-are-people-from-bame-groups-dying-disproportionately-of-covid-19,world, Why are people from BAME groups dying disproportionately of Covid-19?, Co-morbidities  demographics and societal imbalances all play a part  says UCL professor Nishi Chaturvedi, Co-morbidities could certainly play a role. The black population  where the discrepancy appears to be greatest  is particularly afflicted with hypertension. Diabetes is three-fold higher in this ethnic group. Both of those conditions will increase your risk of death once you’ve got Covid. The added problem is that these conditions occur at a younger age in people of black descent. However  in mitigation against that  certainly older people of black African descent don’t smoke as much  so have less respiratory disease  have lower rates of cancers and coronary disease. With Asian populations  the story is a bit different  but again there is a four-fold excess in diabetes and blood pressure rises higher with age in South Asians compared to Europeans. Genetics sounds like an easy get-out clause  but it isn’t. Ethnicity is a complex socio-cultural construct  it’s not a biology construct. There’s no gene for being Asian. There’s no gene for being black. People of ethnic group membership can change over time and with age  it’s not an immutable thing and it very poorly maps on to any biology you can think of. People have looked to see if there’s a genetic explanation for these ethnic differences in chronic disease and have been unable to find one  despite having looked quite hard in large numbers. So there’s no evidence that genes explain the excess risk of Covid susceptibility. It’s important to put a nail in that one because it feels as if we can abdicate any responsibility for sorting this out and this really isn’t the case. Ethnic minorities are over-represented in high-risk occupations  including health workers  in the transport sector and essential shop work. Clearly  there’s a huge amount of heterogeneity  but overall ethnic minorities are more likely to live in deprived  dense  over-crowded urban areas and are more likely to be disadvantaged. In some cases  household composition could play a role  particularly in Asian households where you have multi-generational households living together. So both through occupation and residential reasons  they’re less able to socially isolate effectively and much more likely to be exposed to high doses of the virus. There’s some suggestion that the greater the dose you’re exposed to the more likely the disease is to prove fatal. That’s perhaps one reason why even quite young healthcare workers are succumbing to the disease. The evidence on ethnic differences in healthcare seeking behaviour is quite messy  and we need to remember that these are quite heterogeneous groups. For instance  people of black ancestry have been found to be less likely to consult for chronic diseases like diabetes  but that doesn’t mean to say that if it’s an acute condition they won’t come forward. One study of people accessing antiviral flu treatments in the flu pandemic of 2009 found that ethnic minorities were less likely to ask and less likely to collect these. But whether this was due to reluctance  differences in access to healthcare  the way the message was put across or racism – it is difficult to pick apart because the healthcare seeking process is so complicated. Ultimately  this is about health inequalities  about deprivation and affluence and how important socio-economic status is in determining health outcomes. This isn’t just an ethnicity story  it affects all of us. Britain has a long history of health inequalities. It’s critically important to understand and I’m relieved that the government is taking this seriously. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d63b5f5370b31b954d037f434ace41df8b2b57/0_2_5245_3147/master/5245.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d036074979c4b82e3108c9e2a2c5d56 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CScience%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMicrobiology%2CBiology%2CMedical+research%2CWorld+news%2CRace https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/favouring-young-over-old-in-covid-19-treatment-justifiable-says-ethicist,world, Favouring young over old in Covid-19 treatment justifiable  says ethicist, Prof Arthur Caplan: age a “valid criterion” to use when making the “terrible choice”, “To the extent to which data supports the risk of failure or the odds of success  age can justifiably be used to ration care if maximisation of lives saved is the overarching goal ” said Caplan – who is ethics adviser to the US government – in remarks in a debate published on Wednesday in the British Medical Journal. “The relevance of old age as a predictive factor of efficacy – combined with the powerful principle of healthcare affording equality of opportunity to enjoy a life – makes age an important factor in making the terrible choice of who will receive scarce resources in a pandemic ” the founding head of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s School of Medicine added. The row comes amid reports of an increase in the use of “do not resuscitate”  “do not treat” and “do not convey to hospital” orders for older people during the pandemic. Under the Equality Act  it is illegal to deny an older person access to healthcare on the basis of their age. But a “frailty” tool is being used across the NHS to determine which older people should be asked about limits to treatment  with age making up 50% of the frailty score. Dave Archard  emeritus professor at Queen’s University  Belfast  said an overburdened service is no excuse for discrimination that would result in a “cull” of older people. Using age as an indicator of clinical frailty and the likelihood of survival is  he said  crude and unreliable. “And if it is not a marker of something else then it is hard to see why age should be used as the determinative criterion ” he added. “It becomes exposed as wrongly discriminatory because it licences differential treatment based on ‘unwarranted animus or prejudice’ against old people. “To discriminate between patients in the provision of care on the grounds of age is to send a message about the value of old people. Such discrimination publicly expresses the view that older people are of lesser worth or importance than young people. It stigmatises them as second-class citizens. “It would be hard not to think – even if it was not intended – that a cull of elderly people was what was being aimed at.” Catherine Foot  director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better agreed. “Chronological age must never be the principle factor that determines a person’s right to care. Medically speaking  it is a poor proxy for a person’s capacity to respond well to intensive care and to recover. “And rationing care based on age speaks of a dangerous kneejerk ageism  where the older we get  the less value we have and the less important our lives are to save ” she said. Caplan said that while blanket exclusion based simply on age is wrong  he pointed out that it is already often used to decide who gets care when rationing is unavoidable. “There are two main principles which ground the use of age [in deciding who gets treatment] ” he said. “The first is the notion of fair innings – that each existing person ought to enjoy an opportunity to live a life. [The second is if] the overarching principle for rationing is to maximise the number of lives saved.” The Department for Health and Social Care said: “Care and treatment for any individual should be based  as always  on an informed discussion between the patient and their treating clinician. Coronavirus does not change this in any way. The NHS has the capacity to provide ICU care for anyone who needs it.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9d2fe00dcb86444d5e0a0cc93d3d7331a240008/0_333_4267_2560/master/4267.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00fe6e59f3e41510c23b2a42f7859e1b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CEthics%2CHospitals%2CSociety%2CWorld+news%2CEquality+Act+2010%2CUS+news%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/what-is-happening-is-not-normal-we-100-need-answers-this-is-not-adding-up,world, 'What is happening is not normal. We 100% need answers. This is not adding up', Zia Wassan says there is a feeling of vulnerability in BAME communities like his and more needs to be done prevent deaths, “My dad went before his time  he shouldn’t have died ” says the 35-year-old. Zia’s father  Choudhary Aslam Wassan  67  a popular and charismatic former food business pioneer and political campaigner from Birmingham  died from coronavirus last month. His son says the disease has also claimed the lives of at least 10 of his father’s friends – middle-aged Asian men with underlying health conditions – in recent weeks. These men are among thousands of people of BAME backgrounds who find themselves at the forefront of a disturbing statistic. They are over-represented in the Covid-19 death toll by 27%. This means that for every four fatalities you would expect to see among BAME people an additional Covid-19 related fatality has occurred. Of patients who died in hospital up to 19 April  19% were BAME  while these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. For Zia  this statistic and the untimely deaths of his father and his friends are not only shocking but require in-depth investigation. He says there is a distinct feeling of vulnerability in communities like his – inner-city  historically impoverished areas with high levels of health issues  and more needs to be done within these communities to stop the transmission and subsequent deaths from the disease. “What is happening is not normal. We 100% need answers. This is not adding up - why are so many Asian men dying. It is not normal. There is something behind this and it’s my strong view that it needs to be investigated ” he says. “It just doesn’t make sense. We need to know why they are not coming back from hospital. My dad definitely went before his time and I’d say a good 10 of his friends have all died in a similar way. They had underlying health problems  got a fever  ended up in hospital and then didn’t come back.” Wassan  a great-grandfather  first started displaying symptoms of the disease on 20 March. Before lockdown he had been travelling around the country  including attending a funeral. “He first just got a cough and was told to self-isolate. He was in good health but was a type-2 diabetic so we were hoping he would be given antibiotics  but the GP decided not to ” said Zia. He said that although antibiotics are not considered effective treatment for Covid-19  other family members displaying symptoms who had received them had survived. “He carried on following the rules but then his cough started to get worse and he had a fever. He was worse and then we called an ambulance. Within two hours of getting to hospital they had taken him away to intensive care. Nobody could see him or be with him. “Then later  he phoned me and said he was being told that he wasn’t getting better and they would need to put him to sleep and on to a ventilator – that’s the last time I spoke with him. He told me to look after my mum and the family: ‘Take care of yourself  and I will see you in three days ’ but that was the end.” Wassan would never return to his home in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. His ventilator was switched off after he showed no signs of recovering. He died in the City hospital on 29 March. Zia’s mother  Tanvir  was herself briefly hospitalised with symptoms of the virus  while other members of the family have also been ill. They are all now recovering at home with Zia currently in self-isolation. Zia said: “When he first started showing symptoms he asked his GP for antibiotics but he wasn’t given any. I don’t understand this because he was in a high-risk category. This must be happening to lots of other Asian families too. They need to be treated with more care if it is emerging that they are at higher risk  surely.” The Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood  who had known Wassan for around 30 years  backed calls for an investigation into the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities. Mahmood  who has previously said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines surrounding physical distancing  said some communities would bear the brunt of the disease. “What we are seeing play out here is the result of years of austerity cuts within NHS services in these poor  deprived areas like Handsworth and Lozells. Where historically these communities have not been supported and which has now made them devastatingly vulnerable to this disease. It is an absolute disaster  we need to protect these people ” he added. Wassan  came to Birmingham from Pakistan in the 1970s  aged 21  with his brother Ashraf Wassan  and devoted his life to the city. He championed Labour activists in the city  including Mahmood  now MP for Perry Barr  and Waseem Zaffar  now cabinet member for transport and the environment for Birmingham city council. He is survived by his wife and six children Zia  Waheed  Saeed  Rukiya  Sadia and Shazia. A seventh child  Naveed  died in 2009. Nephews Jawaad  Zahid and Shahid Ashraf are among a large extended family. He was a grandfather of 23 children and has one great grandchild. • This article was amended on 24 April 2020 to include additional context from Zia Wassan. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1255f79dcb86fa1ee2b11eeee3504a29317efa/110_364_618_370/master/618.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89be28e9ed5e553ca66521e9df381335 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5693a5064e4d3b7167eafa9800f61f696f4cb008/0_367_739_922/master/739.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74ca7d0dd401ecb3ba35a7b2c76cf2d3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f25bef5ab5c582a9db9d8671eeed4e48a8bdf18/147_412_572_714/master/572.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5a8c3ca8fe2bdeee6faad95e0cead3d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c3165f98e7945eac0bb987f7f4ba38c6fe32e3/49_355_625_780/master/625.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b12dcc181e02fe010b606ec4842c2826 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2CBirmingham%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/without-a-plan-its-not-going-to-stop-care-homes-fear-worst-yet-to-come-covid-19,world, GP calls for action after 125 of her care home patients die of Covid-19, Lack of coherent strategy for coronavirus fuels fears of devastating death toll, “One home had 23 deaths  another lost 19  and another 13 ” the Ealing GP said. “In two units 50% of residents died in the space of 10 days.” Down is the clinical lead at a practice with 1 000 residents on its books in 15 privately run nursing homes in the area of west London hit harder than anywhere in Britain by Covid-19 deaths in the first weeks of the outbreak. In a normal month  she might expect to lose around 28 people. In the last month she has lost 125. Down has a warning to the rest of the country informed by her practice’s experience: reform how social care handles Covid-19 or face rising deaths and a second devastating wave of infection. Her anger goes beyond grief. Her early warnings to public health authorities about the risks to care residents were not acted on  she said; infected patients continue to be discharged into care homes from hospitals  spreading the virus; and staff shortages are blighting attempts to keep the virus isolated. High-protection FFP3 face masks requested so staff could treat residents with “aerosol-producing” lung problems and tracheostomies never came. Carers were left to spread the disease and fell ill. “From the moment this started we highlighted where the problems were going to be and said we can get on top of this now ” Down said. “Yet no definitive and timely action was taken across the health and social care system.” The last few weeks have been devastating on the frontline. The manager of the Ealing home where 23 people died in just two weeks described conditions as “terrible”. “I have never written so many death notifications in such a short time ” she said  on condition of anonymity. “Every member of staff is lost. They don’t know what to do. In one of our units with 21 residents we lost nine people in three days. It’s OK when you hear the numbers on TV. They are removed from reality. One day a resident was walking around with a mild temperature. I went home and the next morning they were dead.” The manager repeated a refrain heard in care homes everywhere at the moment: “There is so much focus on the NHS but there is little done for care homes. “The staffing situation is getting critical. I have seven nurses and 12 care assistants off. The care home sector needs help: staff  protection and volunteers. This has been going on since the beginning of April and I still think we are heading for the worst.” Ministers admit official figures understate the scale of problems in care and nursing homes. Niall Dickson  the head of the NHS Confederation  described care this week as “the second front”. It may yet become the main battleground. Official figures on Tuesday put the impact on Covid-19 on care homes at just over 1 000 fatalities to 10 April. But HC One  the biggest private provider  has alone lost almost 500 people to confirmed or suspected Covid-19 and the virus is active in 120 of its 328 homes. Given there are more than 15 000 care homes in England and Wales  Prof Martin Green  the chief executive of sector association Care England  predicts care home deaths will outstrip hospital fatalities (17 337 in England and Wales by Tuesday). Yet demands for social care to be urgently reconfigured with NHS-style “whatever it takes” resourcing are yet to be met. Down has ideas  if anyone will listen. Given isolating Covid-19 sufferers within homes frequently fails  there need to be “hot homes” for accepting Covid-positive discharged from hospitals and “cold homes” for those without the virus. She describes them as “the equivalent of the Nightingale hospitals for nursing homes”. Down believes homes are inadequately staffed to deal with the volume and intensity of demand and need nursing support from local hospitals. Staff need to be tested “early and often”  and there needs to be central management of discharged hospital patients so they are put in the safest  rather than most available vacancy. “In terms of deaths  I don’t think we have peaked yet ” she said. “Every time people die  more people are discharged into the homes from hospital. Without a new strategy it’s not going to stop.” The North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups declined to comment. The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted. The deaths are all personal disasters. Another manager in Ealing described how the deaths of six people in short order left her staff “panicking”. “It came as quite a shock ” she said. “It happened so quickly – boom. We had little information about the right protocol on PPE  there were never clear guidelines on isolating  sending people to hospital  whether to wear masks.” Her home still faces a PPE shortage and cannot afford the prices of kit on the open market. Ministers may have promised £3.2bn to councils to help the Covid-19 response  but requests for financial aid to the local authorities to buy scarce essentials such as hand gel – “like gold dust” – has yielded nothing yet. Testing has been slow too. Swabs were sent from two residents  but results never came back. One of them died. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are ramping up testing to ensure all symptomatic staff and residents are tested  as well as testing all patients before they are discharged back to their care home - in addition to recently-updated hospital discharge guidance. “So far we have delivered nearly 1 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England and are working closely with the ONS  PHE and the CQC to better understand the worrying number of deaths from Covid-19 in care homes and how we can prevent them.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Robert-Booth,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56d89db0e76817f31266f2a67a0d2e76 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19bb5d0a2b32a7c0a9af16343234928a2b012f73/0_202_5614_3369/master/5614.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03052016710610bf17451fbb36a83820 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSocial+care https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/22/true-life-portraits-imaginary-nuptials-and-fantasising-sheep,news, True-life portraits  imaginary nuptials and fantasising sheep, Creativity erupts in spinning lambs and humans conjuring up a stand-in wedding  Instagram NHS gallery and indoor marathon, Artists create gallery of NHS portraits Instagram has been flooded with portraits of NHS workers as artists use their skills to pay tribute to those working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis. The #PortraitsforNHSHeroes project was started on Instagram by Tom Croft  an artist  early in April when he offered a free oil portrait to the first NHS frontline worker to message him. Since then  more than 500 artists have contributed portraits in all shapes and styles. Adrian Hill  an artist in Pontefract  created an oil painting of his wife  Shelley  who works for the Yorkshire ambulance service. Meanwhile Barry Miller created a series of vivid oil paintings depicting NHS workers in scrubs and protective gear  as well as a picture of a police officer. Croft said: “It’s grown quicker than I could have imagined. It’s been amazing. It’s been moving to read all of the messages from NHS key workers about how this is brightening up their day  or at least giving them something positive to look forward to in these incredibly tough and challenging times. “I knew the art community would respond in this way but it’s still wonderful to see it happen in reality.” Croft originally paired up artists with key workers but after a “wonderfully overwhelming” response created a facility for artists to advertise their services and pair up themselves. He said he wanted the project to be “as big as we can go  giving as many thank you [messages] through the form of portraiture as we can”. When the lockdown restrictions are lifted  Croft said  he hoped to hold an exhibition of all the portraits in one place. He is in talks with galleries. Neighbours surprise couple with wedding celebration A couple in Wetherby  West Yorkshire  who had to postpone their wedding due to the coronavirus outbreak were treated to a surprise from neighbours who created a “big day” for them. Phil Richmond  27  and Allie Lawton  25  decorated their lounge with balloons  confetti and fairy lights  while their children Lily  four  and Ben  two  became the attendees along with some soft toys. “I did try and make Phil sleep on the sofa [the night before] so we slept apart but he refused ” Lawton told the BBC. She got ready with her bridesmaids via a Zoom (online) call and pretended to walk down the aisle in the living room. “As far as we were aware  that was all we were doing on our wedding day ” she said. Then Lawton’s mother said she had left a bottle of champagne at the end of their drive  and when the couple went to retrieve it they found their neighbours dressed up and outside ready to celebrate. A song for the couple’s first dance was played  and the family were showered with confetti as they walked down a makeshift aisle. “It just gave me the most heartwarming feeling  I was welling up the whole way round ” said Lawton. “We just want to say thank you to everyone on our lovely street […] we never want to move house now.” The window of one house was decorated with an A&P sign surrounded by hearts  while a “Just married” sign was corrected to read “Married soon”. “It will be a day that we remember for ever really ” said Richmond. London marathon in a living room A man in Northern Ireland is planning to run the equivalent of the London marathon in his living room this weekend  after the world-famous event was postponed until October. Col Bignell  26  a retail worker from County Down  was disappointed at missing his first marathon  but instead will be running the length of his living room thousands of times to cover the miles. Bignell  originally from London  dared his Facebook friends to “give him the push” by giving his post 260 likes. He said he intended to raise money for the NHS with the run. “I’ve marked out the space and it’s around 12ft  so I’ve worked out I’ll be running laps of my front room around 11 500 times ” he told the PA Media news agency. “I’ve seen Tom Moore [the 99-year-old who walked 100 laps in his garden to fundraise for the NHS] and the lady who did the stairs  and thought if they can do it why not do something myself?” Bignell aims to raise £260.20 for the NHS to correspond with the 26.2 miles he will run  and has already raised £140 towards that goal. Sheep investigate empty McDonald’s in Wales A flock of sheep were spotted exploring an empty McDonald’s restaurant in Ebbw Vale  Wales. “Even the sheep in Ebbw Vale are having McDonald’s withdrawals ” joked Andrew Thomas  who photographed the animals. Thomas said he came across the curious flock on Saturday afternoon as he left the Aldi store next door where he had been shopping for food for his mother who was isolating. The sheep are not the only animals to have been spotted in unusual places in the lockdown. A group of playful lambs was spotted spinning on a roundabout in a children’s playground in Monmouthshire. “Even though the park is shut it was great to see these lambs enjoying themselves this morning ” said Gareth Williams  owner of the flock kept at Raglan Farm Park. “It would normally be too busy for the lambs to get a chance. Just hope they don’t get too dizzy.” And who could forget the mountain goats of Great Orme who took over the seaside town of Llandudno last month? And finally … Banksy mural gets face mask A famous Banksy work in Bristol has been modified with the addition of a face mask. Girl with a Pierced Eardrum  which appeared in the street artist’s home city in 2014  is a parody of the painting Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Johannes Vermeer. The mural  at Hanover Place  acquired a face mask in a nod to the coronavirus pandemic. Banksy has been contacted for comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76f1b25e03c8380da0d24832a6b15aa54cd0b3a/122_57_558_335/master/558.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=defbefe0739d8cd811f68e0363ed5543 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e866a0a3aa49bee9a3262f7e57d54756fc5d9caf/0_330_3527_4402/master/3527.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d11ed43c1a1431a013d5090b046663c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24c0b4e5f0e96d42ff6b4d44b9e34ef50a85d2aa/0_12_1582_1976/master/1582.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a42e0ac533552630170692961fc33d5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0bbb89f518cd1504bfe889acbb3add27663e860/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b477252e9c72c234854e71971bd92eb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76f1b25e03c8380da0d24832a6b15aa54cd0b3a/0_32_713_428/master/713.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e534e9e0e54a1e813b10d877b2ce1346 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9e8c43ca7393afe2f1d47241ed56b8e2b83c502/0_16_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7878fd43f86bef760d6b08ed237e89a9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CSociety https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/top-economist-us-coronavirus-response-like-third-world-country-joseph-stiglitz-donald-trump,business, Top economist: US coronavirus response is like 'third world' country, Joseph Stiglitz attacks Donald Trump  saying US on course for second Great Depression, In a withering attack on the president  Joseph Stiglitz said millions of people were turning to food banks  turning up for work due to a lack of sick pay and dying because of health inequalities. The Nobel prize-winning economist said: “The numbers turning to food banks are just enormous and beyond the capacity of them to supply. It is like a third world country. The public social safety net is not working.” Stiglitz  a long-term critic of Trump  said 14% of the population was dependent on food stamps and predicted the social infrastructure could not cope with an unemployment rate that could hit 30% in the coming months. “We have a safety net that is inadequate. The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health. In the advanced world  the US is one of the countries with the poorest health overall and the greatest health inequality.” Stiglitz said Republicans had opposed proposals to give those affected by coronavirus 10 days’ sick leave  meaning many employees were going to work even while infected. “The Republicans said no because they said it would set a bad precedent. It is literally unbelievable.” He added: “The safety net is not adequate and is propagating the disease. There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don’t think they can rely on it.” During an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People  Power  and Profits  Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second Great Depression. “Yes is the answer in short ” he said. “If you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression. If we had the right policy structure in place we could avoid it easily.” Stiglitz said that as a result of Trump’s mismanagement  the White House office responsible for pandemics had been closed  funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cut  and the US had gone into the crisis without enough testing kits  masks and protective gear. Encouraged by Trump  some parts of the US were determined to reopen in a way that would facilitate the transmission of the disease and lead to a fresh outbreak  he added. “In those circumstances it won’t be the government enforcing the lockdown  it will be fear. The concern is that people are not going to be spending on anything other than food and that’s the definition of a Great Depression. “We were unprepared but  even given the degree of unpreparedness  Trump’s decision to make this about politics rather than about science has meant we have responded far more poorly.” Stiglitz said that if Trump were defeated in the presidential contest in November and the Democrats took control of both houses of Congress there was a chance of the US moving in a more progressive direction  but he warned Republicans would fight dirty in order to cling on to power. “There is voter suppression and gerrymandering. The Republican party knows it’s a minority party and there is a no-holds-barred struggle going on to make sure a minority party rules America.” Stiglitz said the current crisis would force countries to make themselves less vulnerable  and this would lead to shorter supply chains and a greater emphasis on self-sufficiency in food and energy. He added that the complexity of modern production methods meant autarky was not feasible but added: “Fighting global pandemics and climate change require global cooperation. It’s just that the president of the United States doesn’t understand that. “I hope we emerge from this with the perspective that multilateralism is even more important than we thought. It can’t just be a corporate-driven globalisation. We have to make it more resilient.’ , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0befebfacb3104ff4e65906d2f4187d89203a151/0_20_3198_1919/master/3198.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35f3929afb5ba43b9f173b9c1dc654ed https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=US+economy%2CEconomics%2CDonald+Trump%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/22/world-bank-warns-of-collapse-in-money-sent-home-by-migrant-workers,global-development, World Bank warns of collapse in money sent home by migrant workers, Covid-19 unemployment expected to cause $110bn drop in remittances to developing world, Remittances to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are projected to fall by nearly 20% to $445bn (£360bn)  “representing the loss of a crucial financial lifeline for many vulnerable households”  the World Bank said. Describing the decrease as the worst in recent history  including the 2008 financial crisis  the Washington-based development bank said migrant workers were especially vulnerable to losing their jobs during coronavirus lockdowns which are still largely in place across the developed world. Remittances total aabout three times the amount of aid received by low-income countries and have become a cornerstone of living standards across the developing world. Migrants typically send money to their families to boost living standards in some of the poorest parts of the world  including south Asia  sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eastern Europe is expected to be one of the worst-hit regions as migrant workers in western Europe and Russia are forced to cut back the amounts they send back to families in Romania  Bulgaria  Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries. The World Bank said studies showed that remittances alleviated poverty in lower- and middle-income countries  improved nutrition  were linked to higher spending on education  and reduced child labour in disadvantaged households. “A fall in remittances affect families’ ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs ” it said. Countries that are large recipients of remittances  such as India  have also imposed lockdowns  causing widespread unemployment and hardship  often making the situation even worse for families that suffer a decline in money being sent home. Oil-dependent countries  which have seen crude prices tumble from more than $60 a barrel in January to less than $20 a barrel this week  have also been hit by the economic impact of the pandemic  limiting the amount of help they can offer poor families. Dilip Ratha  chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank  said migrants often worked in insecure jobs and were among the first to be let go in a crisis. “But it is not just that they lose their jobs  the stores they use to send cash home have also shut down ” he said. “Migrants typically send small amounts of cash via stores and these have closed.” Ratha said the developed world has come to depend on migrant workers for cheap and skilled labour  and should do more to alleviate their situation. They need access to healthcare for themselves and their families and cut-price banking facilities  which would allow them to send money home without paying high fees and commissions. Last year  remittances reached an all-time high of $554bn. Next year  the World Bank expects a 5.6% recovery from the $445bn predicted this year to $470bn. It said: “The outlook for remittance remains as uncertain as the impact of Covid-19 on the outlook for global growth and on the measures to restrain the spread of the disease. “In the past  remittances have been countercyclical  where workers send more money home in times of crisis and hardship back home. This time  however  the pandemic has affected all countries  creating additional uncertainties ” it added. Remittance flows are expected to fall across all regions  most notably in Europe and central Asia  where the fall in income is expected to be 27.5%  followed by sub-Saharan Africa  with a 23.1% decline. For east Asia and the Pacific  which includes Indonesia and the Philippines  the fall is put at 13% . , https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/global-development/global-development/logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32a53e74a7d3e7a711a062a509982ea94e86fd99/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f7afc63be82d139841b98fbd3a8f164 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Remittances%2CWorld+Bank%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CGlobal+development%2CGlobal+economy%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/italians-call-for-justice-for-relatives-killed-by-coronavirus,world, Italians call for justice for relatives killed by coronavirus, Facebook group seeks legal action against authorities responsible for errors at start of outbreak, The virus has so far claimed 25 085 lives in Italy  and with the daily death rate still high  the painful stories behind the numbers are starting to emerge as relatives come together to work out a course of action. More than 45 000 people have joined NOI Denunceremo (We will report)  a Facebook group created by Luca Fusco  whose father died of Covid-19 in Bergamo  the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus  as a way to gather testimony for magistrates. “We do not want financial compensation ” said Fusco. “Our main objective is to have justice from a criminal perspective  so if someone is responsible  we want them to be charged and brought to trial.” The aim of the group is not to target health workers  but people in leadership positions who may have underestimated the virus  added Fusco. “The health workers are victims as much as those who have died ” he said. “But as the healthcare system in Italy is decentralised  it would have been those who lead the regions who set the guidelines for hospitals. So if a magistrate decides there is a case  then the responsibility would be at regional level.” Several official investigations are already under way  including one into a hospital in Alzano Lombardo  a town in Bergamo where the symptoms were initially not recognised  allowing it to spread within the hospital and beyond. Prosecutors across the Lombardy region are also investigating possible crimes of negligence and multiple manslaughter following hundreds of deaths in residential homes. Care-home deaths are not recorded in the official statistics  nor are many people who have died at home but were not tested for Covid-19. Meanwhile  doctors’ associations and unions have said they are planning legal action over the deaths of 144 medical workers to date  mostly due to the lack of protective equipment at the beginning of the emergency. Robert Lingard  an Italian who lives in London  filed a dossier with the prosecutor of Brescia  another Lombardy province severely affected by coronavirus  after two of his relatives died; three others were in intensive care. He has asked the prosecutor to establish whether campaigns in Milan and Bergamo encouraging people to carry on as normal  such as going to bars and restaurants or shopping  during the early stage of the outbreak constitute criminal negligence. “Italian public authorities were aware of the aggressiveness of the virus in terms of its spread and the death rate associated with it  given the data coming from China  Singapore and South Korea ” said Lingard. “And they were also aware of the large-scale measures of containment and prevention they had to put in place. However  in spite of this evidence  authorities in Milan and Bergamo seemed to act in denial  without any sense of prudence applied to public health.” The testimonies being shared on NOI Denunceremo share similarities such as the virus being mistaken for ordinary flu and people at home suffering from a fever advised to take paracetamol. Many have lost both of their parents as a result of Covid-19. Italy’s elderly population has borne the brunt  but many young people who were otherwise healthy have also died  including Steven Rovelli  a 31-year-old who died after being transferred to a hospital in Germany for treatment. Martina Salerni  18  lost her 54-year-old father on 10 April. He was at home with a fever and cough for eight days before being admitted to hospital in Abruzzo  among the regions least affected by the contagion. “His initial symptoms didn’t cause any alarm – it was only when he struggled to breathe ” said Salerni. “Our pain is now turning into anger and we demand justice. Our story is the same as so many other families. Whoever made a mistake must take responsibility.” Elena Gazzolla  a lawyer in Codogno  the Lombardy town where Italy’s outbreak emerged  said the challenge was establishing who should take responsibility as well as the legal requirements for groups of relatives launching class actions. In Italy  procedures of this kind are usually undertaken by consumer associations and involve up to 100 complainants. She expects a lot of legal action to be taken by various groups once the emergency is over. “Lawyers are studying the issue and collecting documents to see if there could be eventual judicial processes or compensation for damages ” said Gazzolla  who has so far been contacted by five people who have lost loved ones. “There are many  many aspects to consider.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498f2bbe5ec73070f76d695f03e5cda6f9d1d55f/0_426_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b904578908a5f5b0b97eb48aa924f0e9 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CItaly%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/eddies-last-farewell-a-funeral-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-photo-essay,uk-news, Eddie's last farewell: a funeral in the time of coronavirus – photo essay, The Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod was granted access to the funeral of Eddie Goodall  who died from Covid-19 aged 84. The family could only have a scaled-down funeral  having completed self-isolation themselvesby Harriet Sherwood  photographs by Murdo MacLeod, Then Eddie got coronavirus. He was definitely in the vulnerable category: 83 years old  an ex-smoker  and diagnosed with the lung condition COPD after a working life that started down the pits and ended transporting silt for a water company. At the end of last month  Eddie had gone into hospital in Edinburgh because his breathing was bad. Despite his family’s pleas  he was put in a bed in the coronavirus ward because there was nowhere else for him to go. Twice he tested negative for the virus  and after a couple of days he was sent home. But within a few days he was back. This time his test was positive. Annie and their son Edward  who lives with them  were told to self-isolate for 14 days. Jennifer  the couple’s daughter  was caring for her own daughter Nicole  29  who was recovering from major surgery to remove a cancerous tumour on her liver. No one in the family could visit Eddie. But Annie and her three children  including her other son  David  talked on the phone and made the heartbreaking decision to tell the doctors not to ventilate him if his condition worsened. “Dad had had enough  and we knew how short they were of ventilators. We told the doctor that if there’s someone younger who hasn’t yet lived their life  it should go to them ” said Jennifer  52. “We knew Dad wouldn’t make it through and we just wanted him to go peacefully. But it was the hardest thing we’ve ever had to do.” Soon they got a call from the hospital telling them Eddie was deteriorating rapidly. If you can get here in an hour  you can see him  but there isn’t a lot of time  the doctor said. Annie and Edward couldn’t go as they were self-isolating  but Jennifer and her elder daughter  Sarah-Jayne  rushed to the hospital. They were kitted out in full PPE and told they could hold Eddie’s hand. “He said to me: ‘Am I dying  hen?’ I asked him if he felt if he had one last kick at the ball left in him  and he just shook his head and turned away ” said Jennifer. Sarah-Jayne got Annie on the phone for the couple’s last words to one another. Eddie died the next day  5 April. In a different time  Jennifer reckons there would have been 300 or 400 people at Eddie’s funeral. “Everyone would have been there.” But first they had to wait for Annie and Edward’s self-isolation period to end  and then they had to keep the ceremony to the immediate family. “To look at all the empty pews  it was devastating. You understand why it has to be like that  but you don’t want it to be like that ” said Jennifer. “And now I can’t even go and give Mum a cuddle – imagine that  your own mother  grieving and greeting  and you can’t comfort her.” Andrew Purves  a director with the local firm William Purves which organised Eddie’s funeral  said the pandemic restrictions had been hard on families. “Most people accept this is the way it has to be at the moment  but some people are frustrated and angry. Your parents have done everything for you  and now it’s your turn  but relatives feel: is this all I can do? “There are some people who feel they haven’t been able to do their best  they’ve done a half-baked job  and that is going to have an emotional impact for some time to come.” For Jennifer  the grief over her father’s death  her fears about Nicole’s cancer and worries about her own health are at times overwhelming. Because of the lockdown  Nicole’s father  Gregg  who is separated from Jennifer  is unable to help care for his very sick daughter or even see her. “I’m not going to lie  there are days when floods of tears come ” said Jennifer. “I feel I have to wake up with a smile on my face and keep going for Nicole. Where will she be if I fall apart? But there are times when I feel that might happen.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb434856b418e45a6762a96b948efec41cfb35f/164_362_5572_3343/master/5572.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d1210f34a161c34ae152e2fc93d7b15 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6878924639330f2020c26b6fa151c63a19d6065/50_59_5710_3781/master/5710.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea1464e93323aea71e68f25a69e705dd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfdc5bed2dd02b81599f37659ac3205727d836f2/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=883235c78723825b0f07a0f661815f7f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee58398f53f99e2cb42ef9015437ce6e4f4fdb3/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1039c87749b54a5f4c26eaf7f62b3941 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cea72b150b2fe4327915dc22d0def77a0c8834a/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=465d7b53a9329baffc2c41ab65ba2b2b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b9e5ee13906c788bf0699158f5cad3b29a65db/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=436e9fc4f7f977700e03422d7298a25b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4604d5ad0398640c64b5dda593bb94c6794fe418/507_0_5253_3540/master/5253.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f546c3fa3e686496c0d13476e72e0752 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c564456cf395bde9bc58100ed85fd387bbae9e5c/1025_0_3840_3840/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59fea96a4477b8d9a4c6016f9ab88498 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34ad6253e8b341c715723e7a11000d15aa24c82d/651_0_3840_3840/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c4c18831382309424411fe507fcd0bb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5032e76949c9d4c7f7cad359d1c0d113d20a354/304_129_5456_3711/master/5456.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa35a7cebf6f635a16a17c5e3a0bf5c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93461d818e9e21e5fc22fbf123ffb3536cd057bc/918_0_4842_3840/master/4842.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a109f00281cbc2d13dff633a9f2ada25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d067cef89a932176415730f76b74fdd89c0a5569/478_97_4714_3740/master/4714.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6be1ef8b5e0b4d893720420e969f8d2d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ab6de222fcf08f0cd43ebf70f82f4b2228500f/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc38ce39163e631a89bf2a8ec505d959 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3cbafe860379e9a977a721a7e791dc0d9a8e24/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b999cd4ae740bf5e693bd76a0407cee https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Edinburgh%2CScotland%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/ramadan-in-a-time-of-plague-coronavirus-the-best-thing-is-to-stay-home-stay-quiet,world, Ramadan in a time of plague: 'The best thing is to stay home  stay quiet', For many the inability to pray and eat together will be keenly felt  while others are carrying on regardless, Ordinarily during Ramadan  the holy month that commences this week  Muslim community life swells with special prayers at mosques and crowded iftar dinners that can stretch into the early hours. But that kind of socialising now risks spreading coronavirus  and bans on religious and family gatherings will persist across much of the Islamic world even as businesses and government offices start to reopen. “It’s going to be difficult and depressing ” said Mohammad Faoury  who works for a refugee organisation in Amman  Jordan. “Since I’m single and live alone  Ramadan is the month when I can finally see my family for extended periods of time. It’s a time we strengthen the bond.” The virus has emptied Islam’s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka’bah  the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca’s Grand Mosque  is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque. “Our hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan ” said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami  the imam and director of al-Aqsa  where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. “It is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.” Jamia Masjid  one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir  usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion  politics and life. This month it will sit silent for the first time in living memory. “In Ramadan I would pray all five times of the day at Jamia and would also do iftar there  but this time it is a matter of life and death ” said Fatima  74  from Srinagar. “There is danger outside and the best thing is to stay home  stay quiet.” Indonesia has banned mudik  an annual homecoming in which tens of millions of people travel to see their families for Eid-al-Fitr  the festival that marks the end of the fasting month. Across Israel and Palestine  mosques – as well as churches and synagogues – have been closed. Abdullah Abu Galous  a 38-year-old hardware shop owner from the Palestinian city of Ramallah  said it felt as if Ramadan had been cancelled. “I would never have thought that a tiny virus could stop us from celebrating the month of Ramadan. It has held more than one billion Muslims throughout the world hostage ” he said. Authorities in Turkey have so far resisted calls for a total lockdown  insisting the wheels of the economy must keep turning. But Ramadan will be marked by a new four-day lockdown starting from Thursday night  during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest. The emergency has raised unprecedented issues for many of the religion’s 1.8 billion adherents as they prepare to abstain from food and water during sunlight hours. Several Arab newspapers have carried expert assurances that fasting has not been shown to reduce resistance to the virus. Al-Azhar  Egypt’s top Sunni mosque  said last week that coronavirus could not be used as an excuse not to participate unless it was scientifically established that drinking water helps to ward off the disease. Lockdowns have curtailed the production schedules of some of the soap operas that are a staple of Ramadan evenings in many homes  leaving TV executives scrambling to fill airtime during their most lucrative advertising season. But the inability to pray and eat together may be most keenly felt. In the UK  the Muslim Council of Britain has encouraged people to hold virtual iftars on social media. More than 1 400 people have signed up for nightly iftar broadcast of the call to prayer  and guest speakers are being organised over Zoom by the UK-based Ramadan Tent Project  with the option for viewers to split off into smaller group discussions. “Just because you’re in quarantine  it doesn’t mean you have to spend Ramadan alone ” said Rohma Ahmed  a spokeswoman for the project. Abu Ibrahim  32  said he was keeping this year’s difficulties in perspective. In 2011 he observed Ramadan under airstrikes in Dara’a  southern Syria. The following year he spent the first day of the month dodging Syrian army patrols to escape on foot to Jordan. “People say  how are we going to get through this Ramadan when we can’t see each other  when there’s a health risk ” he said. “We used to put food on the table and hear the sound of bombing. We were scared of death  of our families dying. Coronavirus doesn’t worry me. I’m in my house  with my family  we’re safe  we have electricity  phones  food.” Fa’ek Thyabat  the imam of Bab Al-Rayan mosque in Amman  said the Qu’ran did not explicitly guide worshippers on how to observe Ramadan during a plague  leaving worshippers to navigate the uncharted territory with reference to the wider tradition. “There is a hadith [a prophetic saying] that says: ‘If you hear of a plague in a land  then do not go into it. If it happens in a land where you are  then do not go out of it ’” Thyabat said. “Similarly  if we know that Muslims who eat garlic and onion are advised not to go to mosques because the bad breath will hurt mosquegoers  it is easy to conclude that you cannot go to the mosque when there is the risk of spreading contagious disease.” In a faith without formal hierarchies  not all Islamic leaders share Thyabat’s interpretation. Hundreds of worshippers continue to turn out for prayers in Herat  Afghanistan  where a hardline preacher  Mujib Rahman Ansari  recently advised his followers that death from coronavirus was a form of martyrdom. In neighbouring Pakistan  the government has compromised with clerics by lifting a ban on group prayers during Ramadan on condition that no carpet is laid  children and older people stay away and worshippers wear masks and keep six feet apart. Maulvi Haider Zaman  a prayer leader in Islamabad  said coronavirus was “not an issue” and insisted it was important people still came to offer prayers during Ramadan. “People are not afraid to perform their prayers ” he said. “We will be imposing social distancing in the mosque but I don’t think it is needed as coronavirus will not affect people in mosques. It’s the home of Allah.” In Jordan  Thyabat said he was instructing worshippers to focus on the upsides. Ramadan in past years had been an occasion for increasingly lavish iftar feasts and shopping bonanzas  he said. “This Ramadan is an opportunity for people to re-adopt the real spirit of fasting  which is about austerity and helping relatives and needy people.” Additional reporting by Sufian Taha  Jassar Al-Tahat  Shah Meer Baloch  Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and a reporter in Srinagar , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af7cbbfe2fa79f7fc2a40328b494a67cac2f8d02/0_43_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=903dc582534178b4aafd3cd484060867 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e1a94259d25b4ae76527bdfc3f9d3bfb950e300/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91064abf7c56131f6047b750d3490974 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18670e420052d0b77b0a4d45ec055b6aca24fe00/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=011ece780fbb76f6abea2fd631cfebf0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af945e12af77477199b44b4fdb1efed028312a5/0_299_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56bd771d5491b44251cec1e21166b267 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f2543fc6032f78096e3cedb0eb45c87a200d3a8/0_0_5487_3293/master/5487.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=997f80651e3b669eccebc761647ec6d3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ramadan%2CIslam%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CReligion%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fears-realised-as-first-covid-19-case-diagnosed-in-lebanon-refugee-camp,world, Fears realised as first Covid-19 case found in Lebanon refugee camp, Palestinian woman tests positive as medics scramble to contain outbreak, The patient  a woman in her 40s  is being treated at a state-run hospital in Beirut. A medical team travelled to the al-Jalil camp in Lebanon’s Bekaa valley on Tuesday to screen the women’s relatives and anyone else who had come into contact with her. The UN and authorities in the region had seen such an outcome as almost inevitable. It prompted fresh calls to protect refugees from the pandemic  which could be devastating if it took root among the cramped and often unhygienic confines of refugee camps. “We knew it was a matter of time before we had a case confirmed in the Palestine refugee community  and that’s what happened ” said Tamara al-Rifai  spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). “Our position is that everyone who needs medical treatment for Covid-19 should get it  with no discrimination. UNRWA will cover the cost of the treatment of the confirmed case  and will support her family if they need to isolate themselves.” The rampant spread of coronavirus through developed nations  with advanced health systems  has caused deep alarm in Lebanon  Syria  Iraq  Turkey and Jordan  where more than 12 million refugees  or internally displaced people  have little access to life-saving health care and cannot practise physical distancing. In a separate development  coronavirus is confirmed to have killed a patient in a hospital in north-eastern Syria two weeks ago  the first of its kind in another regional conflict zone. The NGO Médecins Sans Frontières said the diagnosis cast a spotlight on the area’s capacity to deal with the pandemic. “The response in north-east Syria at this time is not nearly enough ” Crystal van Leeuwen  MSF’s medical emergency manager for Syria  said. “A significant increase in assistance from health actors  humanitarian organisations and donors is essential.” As fears grow that refugees will bear the brunt of the next wave of coronavirus  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has increased demands for them to be protected by unholding human rights laws. Its head  Filippo Grandi  said: “The core principles of refugee protection are being put to test  but people who are forced to flee conflict and persecution should not be denied safety and protection on the pretext  or even as a side-effect  of responding to the virus. “Securing public health and protecting refugees are not mutually exclusive. This is not a dilemma. We have to do both. Long-recognised refugee laws can be respected even as governments adopt stringent measures to protect public health  including at borders.” Regional states’ commitment to refugee protection is being increasingly challenged  with many concerned about the strains on their already weakened economies. In Lebanon  Palestinians are routinely denied access to state care. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA)  which has struggled since the Trump administration withdrew funding in 2018  has raised $14m (£11.3m) for its initial Covid-19 response. With much of that money now spent  and fears of infections being realised  UNRWA leaders are launching a second funding appeal. A total of 9 400 refugees are registered at Lebanon’s al-Jalil camp but the real population remains unknown  and could be as low as 3 000. Waves of departures to Gulf states  and undocumented arrivals from Syria over the past nine years  have made actual numbers of refugees in Lebanon  and their whereabouts  difficult to discern. Lebanon hosts around 475 000 Palestinian refugees in 12 camps and 26 unofficial sites. They are among the most impoverished people in the country  which is also believed to have up to 1 million Syrian refugees. Many of the Syrians are living in informal settlements  which are even harder for health authorities to regulate. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefb4f3e98a5588d27c4d62fe7f739b70e77ca1c/0_450_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3276cd8f5945c934f6f8db42c3ee0c47 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Refugees%2CLebanon%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMiddle+East+and+North+Africa%2CWorld+news%2CUnited+Nations%2CHealth https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/south-africa-puts-soldiers-on-standby-as-lockdown-tensions-mount,world, South Africa puts soldiers on standby as lockdown tensions mount, President announces $26bn relief package and will set out plans to lift restrictions, Cyril Ramaphosa  the president and commander-in-chief  has mobilised the 73 000 men and women of South Africa’s armed forces  though it is unclear how many of them may eventually be deployed. Around 3 000 soldiers are already on the streets in support of police and medical personnel. South Africa has recorded 3 465 cases of coronavirus  the continent’s second highest number after Egypt  and 58 fatalities. On Wednesday night Ramaphosa announced a social and economic relief package worth $26bn  and on Thursday he will set out how the lockdown will be lifted. Restrictions are likely to be removed very gradually  officials suggest  though it is widely recognised that the lockdown has caused immense hardship to tens of millions and is requiring increasing levels of coercion to sustain in its present form. Experts said the aim of deploying soldiers would be a “show of force to get people off the streets”. Gareth Newham  of the Institute of Security Studies  Pretoria  said: “We are already starting to see a rise in burglary  looting  vandalism  and that is only going to get worse because of the level of desperation  the increased level of hunger  and the police are overstretched already. “The ability to draw on large numbers [of troops] would have a psychological effect but given the military are not trained for public order there is clearly a high risk of soldiers shooting and killing people.” Though the lockdown has been largely well respected  there have been sporadic incidents of violence in recent days  with crowds targeting trucks carrying food parcels or delivering food to supermarkets. Hundreds of armed police thwarted an attempt to loot a shopping mall near Cape Town on Wednesday. Earlier in the week hundreds of people in the Mitchell Plains township fought running battles with the police  hurling rocks and setting up street barricades with burning tyres  over undelivered food parcels. South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world and has a tradition of street protests against authorities’ failures to provide basic services. “It’s a very  very dangerous situation ” said Scott Drimie  of the thinktank Southern Africa Food Lab. “When you add hunger to that  now there’s deprivation … and then you add the enforcement with the army and police  that needs to be handled very carefully.” The Institute for Poverty  Land and Agrarian Studies said that if people could not get food  “there is every likelihood of violent conflict  including widespread looting.” The latest government figures show 118 000 people have been charged with breaking the lockdown restrictions. The defence minister  Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula  confirmed the decision to mobilise the army on Wednesday. “If you look at the numbers and the rate at which the infection has gone up  you will realise that at some point we may actually need the kind of human deployment which has never been seen before ” she told local radio. Some serious crimes have fallen dramatically during the lockdown  according to figures released on Wednesday. Murders are down by 72% in the last month compared with the same period last year  assaults have fallen by 85% and violent robbery by 70%. The police minister  Bheki Cele  said more than 190 roadblocks had been put in place daily countrywide and more than 680 vehicle checkpoints. “Raids have been conducted which have seen illegal liquor outlets shut down and non-essential services such as mines  factories and other companies busted ” Cele said on Wednesday. Figures also show a sharp fall in recorded gender-based violence  though experts and activists said this was probably due to the difficulties women faced in reaching police or others to report attacks. Tina Thiart  a trustee of 1 000 Women One Voice  an NGO that works through grassroots initiatives to tackle violence against women and children  said women were locked up with abusers and reports to the NGO of gender-based violence had “really spiked”. “The stats we get from everywhere … we believe it is much higher. It comes in waves but this time it feels a lot worse. There’s a real problem in the camps that have been set up for homeless. We are getting calls from affluent households too ” Thiart said. Experts said a rise in reports of abuse of children also suggested an increase in gender-based violence. Last week Ramaphosa said he had ordered that family protection police units be reinforced because “women and girls are being terrorised inside their own homes  forcing them to make desperate calls for help.” South Africa’s efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 have been widely praised. The country has drawn on long experience of fighting infectious diseases to launch an ambitious screening and testing campaign involving tens of thousands of medical personnel seeking out hotspots of infection. However  with winter approaching there are fears of a rapid rise in cases if the lockdown is lifted too soon. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efffdd7b35718f9b71e203228f4877077791d39a/0_227_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db897065f606d5239bce0e74cf5c5d57 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=South+Africa%2CCyril+Ramaphosa%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAfrica%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/missing-wuhan-citizen-journalist-reappears-after-two-months,world, Missing Wuhan citizen journalist reappears after two months, Li Zehua says he was detained and quarantined by Chinese police after reporting on Covid-19, Li Zehua was one of three Chinese journalists who had been reporting from the front lines in Wuhan during some of the worst weeks of the epidemic. He was last seen on 26 February after posting a video in which he was chased by a white SUV and an hours-long live-stream that ended when several agents entered his apartment. In a video posted on YouTube  Weibo and Twitter Li said on 26 February the white SUV had pulled out in front of him while he was driving in the Wuchang district in Wuhan and the people in it yelled for him to stop. Li panicked and drove off with the car in pursuit  recording the video that he posted online later that day. After making it back to his apartment  he saw uniformed police and staff in protective suits knocking on the doors of his neighbours. Li turned the lights off and sat quietly in front of his computer for hours  waiting. Three hours later  a knock came. At least three men entered his apartment  identifying themselves as public security. Li then went with them to a local police station where he was told he was being investigated on charges of disrupting public order. Police later said they would not charge him but because he had visited “sensitive epidemic areas” he would need to undergo quarantine. Li  who had to give his devices over to a friend  spent the next month in quarantine in Wuhan and then in his hometown in a different province. He was served three meals a day  monitored by security guards and able to watch state broadcaster CCTV’s evening newscast. “Throughout the whole time  the police acted civilly and legally  making sure I had rest and food. They really cared about me ” he said. Li said he was released on 28 March and has been spending time with his family. He wished those who suffered during the epidemic a fast recovery. “May God bless China and the people of the world unite.” Li’s tone and comments  neutral and patriotic  were markedly different from his previous videos. Li  who had worked for the state-broadcaster CCTV  travelled to Wuhan to report on the crisis after another citizen journalist and activist Chen Qiushi disappeared. In his videos  he reported on a local neighbourhood committee’s efforts to cover up new infections and interviewed sick residents. He visited a crematorium where a worker said people were being paid more to transport bodies. At the time Li said: “I don’t want to remain silent  or shut my eyes and ears. It’s not that I can’t have a nice life  with a wife and kids. I can. I’m doing this because I hope more young people can  like me  stand up.” Yet  in closing his video on Wednesday  Li quoted a line from a Confucian text about staying true to one’s beliefs. “The human heart is unpredictable  restless. Its affinity to what is right is small. Be discriminating  be uniform so that you may hold fast ” he said.

23/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/test-trace-contain-how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve,world, Test  trace  contain: how South Korea flattened its coronavirus curve, As life begins to return to something like normality in Seoul and beyond  other countries are asking what lessons can be learned, As they waited to wash their hands and pull on disposable plastic gloves before entering the booths  some may have allowed themselves to contemplate life beyond exercising their democratic right: an imminent return to work  a round of golf or  at last  a chance to shop for something more indulgent than food and hand sanitiser. Going out for dinner  let alone voting in a national election  would have seemed almost inconceivable weeks earlier when the coronavirus threatened to exact the same relentless toll on South Koreans as it has in the US and parts of Europe. Long before politicians in Britain accepted that the illness posed a serious threat to public health  South Korea watched the rise in reported daily infections with growing alarm. After the country reported its first case on 20 January  numbers initially remained low before climbing sharply  reaching a peak of 909 daily infections on 29 February. Then something extraordinary happened. The steep rise in cases began to plateau. By late March  daily infections were being counted in the dozens  and then in single digits. In the space of a few weeks  South Korea had flattened the curve. On Wednesday South Korea reported 11 new Covid-19 cases  the fourth day in a row the number was below 15. That brought the total number of patients to 10 683  more than 8 000 of whom have recovered. With 237 deaths so far  South Korea has one of the lowest Covid-19 case mortality rates in the world  at 2.23%. Other countries are now looking to South Korea and its three guiding principles on how to reign in the outbreak: test  trace and contain. Perhaps most striking is South Korea’s ability to tame the coronavirus without resorting to lockdowns of the kind imposed in the UK  Italy and France. In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed elsewhere  South Koreans for the most part stayed calm. There were no reports of hoarding  and the only people queuing were waiting to be tested or to buy face masks … or to vote. By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to “test  test  test”  South Korea had spent weeks doing just that  quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12 000 people – and sometimes as many as 20 000 – a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes  with the results were sent to people’s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270 000 people had been tested. Testing aside  South Korea – the most connected country in the world – also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing. People who tested positive were asked to describe their recent movements  aided by GPS phone tracking  surveillance camera records and credit card transactions. Those details enabled the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to issue alerts  in real time  about where infected people had been before their positive status was confirmed. Amid criticism that the system could trample on privacy  the alerts contained only the gender and age category of each infected person  and names and addresses of the places they had visited. Jerome Kim  the director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul  said South Korea had contained the virus through “decisive and transparent leadership based on data  not emotion.” Aside from testing people and tracking  isolating and treating those infected  the government convince millions of citizens to alter their behaviour  setting out clear principles for physical distancing  and companies were encouraged to allow employees to work from home. “There was compliance with advisories for social distancing and hygiene  like avoiding bars  churches  gyms and hagwon cram schools ” Kim said. “Voluntary cooperation by an informed populace has been a notable feature of the response.” South Korea had already learned a harsh lesson about the cost of delayed action. In 2015 the Middle East respiratory syndrome killed 36 people  infected 186 and forced thousands into quarantine in an outbreak traced to a single visitor from overseas. Its approach has inevitably attracted international attention. The president  Moon Jae-in  has embarked on a campaign of “coronavirus diplomacy” with other world leaders  and the country has exported test kits to at least 20 nations including the US. The government’s newly released playbook on how to contain the coronavirus  Flattening the curve on Covid-19: the Korean experience  says: “South Korea successfully flattened the curve on Covid-19 in 20 days without enforcing extreme draconian measures that restrict freedom and movement of people.” While health officials remain cautious for fear of a second wave of infections  life is slowly returning to a version of normality. This week restrictions on shops  restaurants  bars  gyms  cram schools and religious services – the latter the source of the country’s biggest single outbreak – were relaxed. National parks  forests and arboretums  which are believed to carry lower risks of infection  are set to open gradually  while physical distancing will remain in place until at least early May. “Until we reach herd immunity or we achieve similar levels with a safe and effective vaccine  the new normal  with a stress on hygiene  social distancing and potentially local crackdowns  may continue ” said Kim. The ruling party’s comfortable victory in last week’s national assembly elections has been interpreted as popular approval of the government’s handling of the crisis. But as in so many other countries  the highest praise is reserved for exhausted health workers. “I think the government has done a reasonably good job ” said Lee Mi-young  35  who spent time in hospital after contracting the virus from her husband. “I know that other countries are looking to South Korea as the numbers have gone down here  but I think it is because of the hard work of health officials  not the politicians.” Whichever group deserves credit  South Koreans are eyeing a time in which Covid-19 is no longer the sole determinant of the way they live. There was evidence of that in Seoul this week where people were returning to work and flocking to shopping malls and restaurants. For Kim Tae-hyung  a 31-year-old engineer from Seoul  the cautious embrace of a post-pandemic world meant once again playing the game he loves. “I’m a member of a community football club and we went out to play on Saturday for the first time in two months ” he said. “We were wearing masks while we played  and we were still worried about the coronavirus. But the weather was lovely. And I felt refreshed.” Nemo Kim contributed reporting from Seoul. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/12/28/Justin_McCurry,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04d05d2e2ebf2c9d7a58bd145555a76c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7ff26500a707bd817940dfab8604498055383a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d458d87d5ec460eaeb27f32db305e177 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbabe1a8c06bf55ccf29610577f02f04843fb891/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=457a3c63bf9c1cd5759e3149f82e97fd https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50c40e05fbe4011060ba358b8991c4458ab1c045/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdaa3bab78a38105f6f6ac7e15c2465c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=South+Korea%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/islamist-group-kills-52-in-cruel-and-diabolical-mozambique-massacre,world, Islamist group kills 52 in 'cruel and diabolical' Mozambique massacre, Police say villagers were killed  most beheaded or shot  after some refused to join extremists, More than 50 people were massacred in an attack in Xitaxi in Muidumbe district after locals refused to be recruited to its ranks  according to police cited by local media. Most were either shot dead or beheaded. “The criminals tried to recruit young people to join their ranks  but there was resistance. This provoked the anger of the criminals  who indiscriminately killed – cruelly and diabolically – 52 young people ” police spokesman Orlando Mudumane told the state-owned broadcasting service. The attack occurred more than two weeks ago but details have only emerged now. Militants have stepped up attacks in recent weeks as part of a campaign to establish an Islamist caliphate in the gas-rich region  seizing government buildings  blocking roads and briefly hoisting a black-and-white flag carrying religious symbols over towns and villages across Cabo Delgado province. The flag is also used by Isis and other Islamic extremists. In March  the insurgents briefly occupied the centre of Mocímboa da Praia  a district headquarters  burning government facilities  including a barracks  and brandishing banners of affiliation to the so-called Islamic State. A day later a second town was raided and the district police headquarters badly damaged. Those attackers too carried an Islamic State flag. Twenty to 30 members of Mozambique’s security forces were killed in both attacks  observers said. Local security forces suffer from poor training  minimal equipment and low morale. Attempts to reinforce with expensive foreign mercenaries do not appear to have been effective. At least 150 Russians linked to the Wagner Group  a company that has supplied mercenaries to fight in several African countries  were deployed last year but were forced to withdraw after suffering casualties. The insurgency in the remote north began to grow about two years ago  exploiting widespread anger at the failure of central government to fairly distribute earnings from exploitation of the region’s rich natural resources. Discontent was exacerbated by endemic corruption and a brutal  indiscriminate military response to the violence. The insurgents have so far mainly targeted isolated villages  killing more than 900 people  according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled). The unrest has forced hundreds of thousands of locals to flee and raised concern among big energy firms operating in the region. More than 200 000 people have fled the area hit worst by the violence  according to a local Catholic archbishop  Dom Luiz Fernando. Some have sought refuge among friends and relatives in the port city of Pemba  the capital of Cabo Delgado. An organisation calling itself Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP)  affiliated with Isis  has claimed some of the attacks in the region since last year. The insurgents are known locally as al-Shabaab (“the youth”)  although they have no known links to the extremist group of that name operating in Somalia. The massacre happened on the same day  7 April  that local sources in Muidumbe told AFP that militants went on a rampage  burning bridge construction equipment and ransacking schools  hospitals and a bank. Before the raid  the attackers used loudhailers to warn villagers “not to run away but stay inside the house”  the source said. In the same district  the militants recorded a video of themselves addressing locals in the region’s local vernacular of Kimwani and Swahili. Experts say there is “no quick fix” to the problems underlying the insurgency. “Most importantly  the Mozambican military and security forces need to be restructured … They now face a complex  multilayered and asymmetrical conflict  mostly drawing upon local and regional grievances and networks but increasingly also attracting some limited encouragement and advice from further afield ” Alex Vines  the director of the Africa programme at Chatham House  wrote last month. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9fd1bca85fab790ef97babfa7edcba4e8d7029/0_80_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7db4174b641f6e7cc3353363659febdf https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e84689e78df7850a6ffd063c2c8b12e48f50b2d/0_162_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eab0008e86b821f22b2d0989f8be8e54 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5359f15540246543478e5ed7869cbbe96f27bc/0_219_4150_2490/master/4150.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=593b614a864fb62b63f11fb4f6aa6efc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5897c3c6ea44b7f0b39942880f41500f031abc/0_148_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8257761fe29b23895e6b4abc0d57955 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a493ba2f71db747ff5423a9a848752f982ea521/0_45_1422_853/master/1422.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a09e2867484657244701333d1f4c0ca4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Mozambique%2CIslamic+State%2CAfrica%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/two-syrian-defectors-to-go-on-trial-in-germany-for-war-crimes,world, Two Syrian defectors to go on trial in Germany for war crimes, Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib accused of roles in Assad regime’s torture apparatus, When the conflict began  both men were members of the notoriously vicious intelligence service  which arrested  tortured and killed protesters and opposition figures. But both defected from the regime  and they seemed to have thought that would protect them from their past. On Thursday Raslan and Gharib will appear at a regional court in the south-western German town of Koblenz  the first trial for war crimes relating to state torture in Syria since the start of the conflict nine years ago. Raslan  57  is charged with crimes against humanity  rape  aggravated sexual assault and 58 murders at Branch 251  an intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus  where he allegedly oversaw the torture of at least 4 000 people as a commanding officer between 29 April 2011 and 7 September 2012. The indictment lists prisoners being hung from their wrists  electrocuted  beaten until unconscious and subjected to a method called dulab  or wheel  where victims were forced into a vehicle tyre and then hoisted up and beaten. Eyad al-Gharib  42  a more lowly official allegedly tasked with rounding up protesters  is accused of assistance to torture and murder in 30 counts. Six Syrians who were tortured at Branch 251 have been given the right to appear at the court as co-plaintiffs  though travel restrictions introduced since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe mean only three are expected to be present when the trial begins. The Koblenz trial taking place because in 2002 Germany enacted the legal principle of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity  allowing the prosecution of serious crimes in its courts even if they happened elsewhere. A special war crimes unit at Germany’s federal criminal police was set up in 2003  initially investigating suspected genocides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Yugoslav wars. As thousands of Syrian refugees applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2017  the unit received more than 2 800 tipoffs about crimes allegedly committed under the regime of Bashar al-Assad. In the case of Raslan and Gharib  the initial tipoffs came at least partially from the men themselves. It appears that  when interviewed by German officials  they made little attempt to hide their part in the violent suppression of political dissent. Raslan is understood to have deserted from the regime in 2012  after forces loyal to Assad carried out a massacre in his home town. He sought asylum in Germany in 2014. Living at a refugee shelter in Marienfelde  Berlin  Raslan did not change his name  and he was eventually recognised by other Syrians  including opposition supporters and a prominent human rights lawyer. Raslan appeared to have no fear of German authorities. According to reports in German newspapers  independently confirmed by the Guardian  Raslan entered a Berlin police station in February 2015 to request protection from Syrian and Russian intelligence operatives he believed had followed him to a recent doctor’s appointment. “He appeared to think there was nothing to it ” Christian Ritscher  an investigator for the German public prosecutor general in Karlsruhe  told the Süddeutsche Zeitung. Raslan  who was probably already on the radar of the German war crimes investigators when he sought official protection  was arrested in February 2019. Gharib too gave German investigators more information than they had expected. When interviewed for his asylum application in Germany in the summer of 2018  he freely said that in Damascus he had helped round up protesters and people taking pictures of the protests on their phones  who were transported to Branch 251. He claimed to have deserted in January 2012 because he had been asked to kill civilians  and because three of his colleagues had died in skirmishes near Damascus. His knowledge of the secret police’s procedures led to him being taken in for further questioning  initially as a witness. But he was reclassified as a suspect after revealing extremely detailed knowledge of torture methods  including the use of kettles to burn victim’s backs and the breaking of detainees’ legs with iron bars to stop them taking part in future demonstrations. A legal complaint about the interview procedure led to Gharib briefly being released  but this was rejected by the federal high court last June. The fact he did not try to flee from German authorities in the meantime is likely to count in his favour at trial. Whether Raslan and Gharib will plead guilty or not guilty is unclear. The pair are being represented by separate defence lawyers  who have both declined to comment on their strategy. In the courtroom  the two Syrians’ role in the regime’s torture apparatus will be weighed against their decisions to defect. If it comes to sentencing  “the court will also have to take into account what these men did after taking part in human rights abuses”  said Patrick Kroker  a Berlin-based criminal lawyer working with some of the co-plaintiffs in the case. The hope among the Syrian diaspora is that the trial  which could last two to three years  will not just test the guilt of two individuals but also lay bare the workings of a violent system that suppressed and murdered thousands of civilians. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b636ec9e7a5f02e70428f361e72edec050fb808d/0_219_2961_1777/master/2961.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eaf45c35d468e7846d0240de57e759fb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Syria%2CGermany%2CBashar+al-Assad%2CWar+crimes%2CEurope%2CMiddle+East+and+North+Africa%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/mystery-bird-illness-investigated-after-german-blue-tit-deaths,environment, Mystery bird illness investigated after German blue tit deaths, More than 11 000 cases of dead and sick birds reported in past fortnight, The blue tit is found across Europe and is one of the most common visitors to UK gardens. They eat insects  caterpillars  seeds and nuts and can be spotted all year round in the UK  with the exception of some Scottish islands. According to NABU  symptoms of the diseased birds include breathing problems  no longer taking food and making no attempt to escape when approached by people. The group is advising people to stop feeding or providing drinking troughs for birds to reduce the risk of transmission between them. The first laboratory test results on the dead birds have found a bacterial infection (Suttonella ornithocola) that has been known in the UK since the 1990s and which affects birds similarly. The infection was reported in Germany in 2018. Further test results on birds are expected over the next few days. The infection discovered causes pneumonia in tits – predominantly blue tits – and they become lethargic with fluffed-up plumage and breathing difficulties. There are no reports of this affecting any other animals apart from birds. Dr Becki Lawson  a disease specialist at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL)  said she had not yet seen any recent increase in mortality in blue tits or any other garden bird species in the UK. “We are aware of the recent reports of blue tit mortality from Germany and understand investigations are under way to determine the cause ” Lawson said. “Once a diagnosis is reached  we will be able to comment on whether the condition affecting blue tit populations in Germany is one that we also see in Great Britain.” A spokesperson for the RSPB said the risk to UK bird populations was currently extremely low. “This disease predominantly affects blue tits which are largely sedentary birds and do not move far from where they fledged. If this disease is not already present in the UK  transmission across countries from Germany to the UK will be slow ” they said. Members of the public have been urged to report any sick or dead blue tits through Garden Wildlife Health  a monitoring project run between the ZSL  the British Trust for Ornithology  Froglife and the RSPB. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d137ea70cc05d51bccea2adbc35f3468148162/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5b6a460581ce0d9d4a887d01e59d5a2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44094542883af78d1ab326a0cd18544f8711bf7/0_101_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d30b1f77e86db8d5f463b6d133eabbe0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb4fd943ded225b3ad0c325932e355a7cbd7b3f/96_381_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=06db995b7ba4056f306bf88a38ca1599 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9fac6cf0a36224fd80ef6b3061a0f77ee60b1fc/10_51_1018_611/master/1018.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dc7413c8926f81b5b9d82f30f7f2c70d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b8675b4d3b9e32e54a04114d53b4180f12b527/161_362_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fda0a7f2eafaec4cdf7844ac9b68dd3 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Birds%2CEnvironment%2CGermany%2CAnimals%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CWildlife https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/anne-with-an-e-show-cancelled-angry-fans,world, Anne With an E fans wage digital war with Netflix over cancellation, Outraged fans posted 13m tweets  signed a petition and placed billboards to demand that show be revived for another season, The outspoken orphan who first appeared in Lucy Maud Montgomery’s 1908 novel  Anne of Green Gables  has since appeared in countless movies and television spinoffs – and built a loyal global following. So it should probably come as little surprise that fans of the show’s latest remake – the TV series Anne With an E – are fiercely protective of their heroine. And like Anne  they’re willing to fight for what they believe in. The shows coproducers  Netflix and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)  announced in November that the drama would be cancelled after three seasons. But CBC’s statement that the final season would bring a “satisfying conclusion to Anne’s journey” did little to placate fans. “People were outraged. The cast and the crew were also blindsided by it ” said Lisa E  a Toronto-based organizer with AWAE Fan Projects. “Everyone loves the show obviously. They just couldn’t believe it.” The day after the announcement  the group took to Twitter with rallying cry: renew the show. The group  whose organizers live in Canada  the United States and throughout Europe  quickly raised thousands of dollars to amplify their message  placing five billboards in downtown Toronto and New York’s Times Square. Nearly 300 000 fans signed a petition on Change.org demanding the series be renewed for another season. But the group’s most successful – and most controversial – campaign has been a digital  guerilla-style battle against the two companies. Members of the group have swarmed the comments section of CBC news stories to demand the show’s revival  and posted more than 13m tweets directed at CBC and Netflix. This week  the group arrived en masse in the comments section of Netflix’s quarterly earnings’ call on Youtube. Matters came to a head on Sunday  when the CBC said it would begin block any “Anne-related comments” from news stories. “My sense is that CBC has not dealt with a sustained siege like this before ” said one of the group’s organizers  Rachel G  who lives in New York City. She argued that the public broadcaster – in using social media to increase user engagement – has opened itself up to these broadsides. “A lot of times  CBC’s engagement questions on Twitter are things like ‘What’s your favourite charcuterie? ” said Rachel. “And I’m happy to go in there and say ‘Hey  in this episode of Anne With an E  Gilbert ate meat – and also renew Anne With an E!” In November  CBC Kids published an article suggesting the group was using bots to artificially inflate its influence. “Many of the accounts were created this month  they don’t have profile pics  their usernames are generic names followed by strings of numbers and they don’t have any followers ” the article said. “Of course they were just created that day ” responded Rachel . “I’m not going to go on my personal Twitter and start tweeting about Anne With an E hundreds of times in one day.” The show has been praised for its unflinching portrayal of  slavery  Indigenous experiences  sexual assault and feminism. “As a woman of colour  there’s always been this tension for me watching period dramas – I don’t really see the point of adapting 19th- or 18th-century work if you’re not going to move forward in some way ” said Rachel. “I feel like Anne With an E really tackled stories of people who have always existed but were ignored by television dramas. And it did so in such a beautiful and sensitive way.” To see the show cancelled with no reason given makes little sense  she said. “I’m an analytical person and with the metrics we have about how successful it is … I just don’t get it.” Both Lisa and Rachel admit the odds are low that the show will ever return to offer closure. “At the end of the day it’s television  right? It’s not changing the world ” said Rachel. “But there are just so few shows today that so joyfully optimistic  inclusive and representative. And that’s worth fighting for.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324bc466b9ad689bd5a35af481c4929f807ec63c/0_185_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d3339a52b51ff0f5d8a6fdfc31bbf12 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Canada%2CAmericas%2CNetflix%2CWorld+news%2CTV+streaming%2CTelevision+%26+radio https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/disney-heir-criticises-company-over-15bn-bonuses-cuts-pay,film, Disney heir criticises $1.5bn in bonuses and dividends as company cuts pay, Abigail Disney hits out at executive payouts while staff weather coronavirus impact, Abigail Disney  an Emmy award-winning film-maker and a granddaughter of the company’s co-founder Roy Disney  launched a Twitter tirade against the world’s biggest entertainment group over its treatment of employees. Disney  who in the past has criticised the lucrative pay packages of the executive chairman  Bob Iger  said the $1.5bn in typical dividend payouts would keep staff paid for months. “That’d pay for three months’ salary to frontline workers ” she said. “And it’s going to people who have already been collecting egregious bonuses for years. Dividends aren’t all bad  given the number of fixed-income folks who rely on them. But still 80% of shares are owned by the wealthiest 10%. Pay the people who make the magic happen with respect and dignity they have more than earned from you. This company must do better.” Top Disney executives have made salary sacrifices to “better enable the company to weather the extraordinary business challenges”. Iger gave up the remainder of his $3m salary for this year  while Bob Chapek  who recently replaced Iger as chief executive  will forgo half his $2.5m base salary. “Salary is a drop in the bucket to these guys ” Disney tweeted. “The real payday is in the rest of the package.” The company has protected those lucrative incentive schemes. Iger earned a total of $65.6m in 2018 and $47m last year. His latest package is more than 900 times that of the median Disney worker’s earnings  which stands at about $52 000. Chapek could potentially receive an annual bonus “of not less than 300%” of salary  in addition to a long-term incentive award of “not less than $15m”. “I don’t have a role with the company ” Disney tweeted. “I’m just a citizen who cares.

22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/west-midlands-economy-hardest-hit-from-covid-19-as-auto-sector-stalls,business, West Midlands economy hardest hit from Covid-19 as auto sector stalls, Setback to ‘levelling up’ UK as London’s businesses predicted to recover faster after pandemic, Consultancy KPMG said that an analysis of the likely impact this year on the UK’s regions showed that the closure of car plants and mothballing of hundreds of factories connected to the automotive sector meant the region’s economy would shrink by 10.1%. In a report that matched economic forecasts for each region with the mix of local industries and how they will fare in the pandemic  KPMG said London was better placed than other areas to maintain its economic activity  despite suffering the highest number of cases and deaths in the pandemic. London will contract by 7.3% this year  the report found. The report said London’s services sector  from marketing and advertising to architecture and financial services  could carry on remotely through the lockdown and recover lost ground in the months after the lockdown eases. Meanwhile  the double hit to the automotive sector - which makes up 6% of the local economy - from factory shutdowns and a collapse in demand for new cars meant that a major sector in the West Midlands would be dormant through the lockdown and take time to recover during the rest of the year. KPMG’s chief economist  Yael Selfin  said the damage caused to the UK’s regions outside London and the south east would be a setback for the government’s plans to “level up” the north and west of the country with the east and the south. “Our analysis highlights how the government’s ambition to ‘level up’ the UK will face a setback as a result of the pandemic. We expect that the gap between performance in London and the rest of the UK will widen this year ” she said. The north west and east midlands  which also rely on manufacturing industries and lack many of the most resilient service industries  will also suffer more than most regions along with the East of England region  which KPMG said relies disproportionately on residential and commercial building  which has ceased during the lockdown. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the north west and the east midlands will contract by 9.5% and 9.7% respectively while the GDP of the East of England region will shrink by 10%  KPMG predicts. “At the other end  we expect London will be the least affected region ” Selfin said. “We forecast the economy will contract by just over 7% in 2020. A relatively higher share of services that are less impacted by Covid-19  like financial and professional services  mean the capital’s economy is more resilient to the restrictions imposed by the lockdown. “An ONS survey conducted last year showed that more than 34% of London workers had worked from home at least once  compared to 27% for the UK as a whole ” she added. Northern Ireland and the north east  which will contract by 8% and 8.4% respectively  perform relatively well because they boast large food manufacturing businesses  which have maintained or increased production  and a higher proportion of public sector employers. Northern Ireland also has a cluster of life science businesses that have benefited from an emphasis on healthcare and pharmaceutical spending by the government and private sector. Earlier this month the Treasury’s economic forecaster  the Office for Budget Responsibility  said Britain’s economy could shrink by 35% this spring and unemployment soar by more than 2m due to the coronavirus crisis. It said Covid-19 lockdown measures would cut GDP by more than a third in the second quarter of the year and by 13% for 2020 as a whole. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216d9bfcde58d194eaa76694b5965768c40e54d6/272_272_5044_3026/master/5044.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5d45f6c5161ccddc520e61d712adf7c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Business%2CUK+news%2CKPMG%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CServices+sector%2CAutomotive+industry%2CManufacturing+sector%2CFood+%26+drink+industry%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/uk-firms-plan-legal-action-against-hiscox-over-covid-19-insurance-claims,business, UK firms plan legal action against Hiscox over Covid-19 insurance claims, More than 100 pubs and nightclubs join forces over non-payment of pandemic claims, Hiscox sold policies before coronavirus hit the headlines  stating it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease. Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic. Michael Kill  the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA)  which is coordinating the action  said: “Businesses are being denied legitimate insurance claims  many claims are being disputed by insurers based on contrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis.” Paul Daly  the owner of Roadtrip & The Workshop bars  housed in one building in Shoreditch  in London  and a member of the NTIA group  said he paid £18 000 a year for his business interruption insurance policy with Hiscox  which he believed included cover for government-imposed shutdowns during a pandemic. Daly’s takings plunged to zero when his venue closed on 17 March but his claim with Hiscox has been turned down. “People’s livelihoods are at stake here. I’m worried. It shouldn’t have to be into this when I’ve spent tens of thousands of pounds on insurance. It’s like someone came into my bar and bought a drink and then I don’t give it to them.” The group  which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC  is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer. On Wednesday  Hiscox said it had about 10 000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures. It said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the “general measures” taken by the government in response to the pandemic. It said in a statement: “A number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry  its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.” The NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups  together involving about 200 more claimants  also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox. One action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC  representing more than 30 businesses including gyms  restaurants and golf professionals  said at least some of Hiscox’s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was “due to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease”. Roger Topping  of the action group  said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed. Business interruption policies typically pay up to £100 000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood  fire  or even when a murder prevents the site from opening. Simon Ager  who runs the Pinnacle climbing centre in Northampton  started an action group that now has more than 100 members after being told his policy with Hiscox  including cover for losses up to £100 000  would not pay out on coronavirus pandemic claims. On Wednesday  Hiscox said it had about 10 000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures. Hiscox added it was “actively settling claims” for event cancellation and abandonment  media and entertainment and other industries including travel. It expects to pay out $150m (£120m) to settle claims if restrictions on travel and mass gatherings continue for six months. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1743c222600743e42900fdb3301e7ba6d266ebb6/0_300_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82f371b31caf12c90f52832490509010 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1768b003115f234fedc2262c2988896c7db4fe0e/0_201_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91dc236412f78152deeb54b638c23a47 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Insurance+industry%2CHiscox%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/cornish-copper-find-metal-mining-industry,business, Cornish copper find raises hopes for once 'richest square mile', Cautious optimism that discovery of high-grade deposits could kickstart revival of metal mining, During exploration for lithium in hot underground springs in Cornwall  engineers came instead upon high-grade copper in a previously unmined area. Further drilling will take place to confirm the extent of the discovery in the parish of Gwennap  near Redruth  but there is cautious optimism that the discovery could kickstart something of a comeback for the industry. “It’s a very exciting new discovery ” said Richard Williams  the chief executive of Strongbow Exploration  which owns the mineral rights at the site United Downs. “It tells us there are areas of mineralisation that are relatively close to the surface and are potentially mineable. The plan is to get back in there and do some additional drilling to find out how big the zone is.” The copper was 100 metres down but the company believes the zone could extend close to the surface. Surrounding mines were worked to a depth of 500 metres below the surface. Williams said: “The hope is that this zone continues to that depth and continues laterally east and west.” He said the global average grade of mined copper is about 0.5%. “We’ve found in this zone the average is 8% copper – 16 times the average grade. Those types of grade are pretty rare ” he added. Cornwall has a long and proud mining history stretching back to the early bronze age. Reserves of copper  tin  zinc  silver and arsenic have all been exploited for many centuries. Gwennap was the richest copper producing region in Cornwall (and the world) in the 18th and early 19th centuries  earning it the title of “the richest square mile on Earth”. As well as making fortunes for mine owners  the industry had a profound effect on the cultural life and social history of the far south-west of Britain. It gave the world the Cornish pasty – originally a wholesome and practical lunch for miners – and was a backdrop for Winston Graham’s Poldark novels  which were turned into television hits in the 1970s and again more recently. In the face of competition from abroad and falling demand  mining declined in Cornwall and the county’s last surviving tin mine  South Crofty  shut down in 1998. But in July 2016 Strongbow Exploration took on South Crofty along with additional mineral rights covering an area of approximately 15 000 hectares (37 065 acres) scattered throughout Cornwall  including the United Downs project. Strongbow entered into an agreement with a company called Cornish Lithium in January 2017. Cornish Lithium was given the right to explore Strongbow’s mineral rights for lithium in underground salt water  while Strongbow retained the right to any discoveries in hard rock that it came upon. The work at South Crofty continues. Strongbow recently applied for a permit to drill at the mine. Owen Mihalop  the company’s chief operating officer  said: “The intention is to demonstrate that there is potential to discover a lot more  in particular tin mineralisation at South Crofty. The Covid-19 crisis has delayed that.” He added: “I think in general people in Cornwall would like to see a resurgence in the industry. The feedback we have received around South Crofty is that people would like to see that back in production. This is a historical mining area. On the whole I think people are positive about the jobs and economic benefits mining can bring.” A spokesperson for Cornish Lithium said: “Cornish Lithium continues to enjoy a strong relationship with Strongbow Exploration and is excited about the opportunities that this discovery highlights for the mining industry in Cornwall. “Separately  Cornish Lithium is equally encouraged by the results from our exploration drilling programme for lithium in geothermal waters at this site and are continuing to evaluate the opportunity to extract lithium in this area and elsewhere in Cornwall.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/12/27/Steven_Morris,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64a7b004687b61385d763035f9bdc39c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9db80245e390ae6f249c855865145bf7ad346c/0_284_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93887631e930e4643863e49602f24338 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Mining%2CCornwall%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/boohoo-eyes-struggling-fashion-brands-trading-beats-forecasts,business, Boohoo eyes struggling fashion brands after trading beats forecasts, Online retailer reports 54% profit rise and says it is well-placed to assess opportunities, The online fashion specialist  which has been flagged as a potential buyer for the Oasis and Warehouse chains that collapsed into administration last week  reported a 54% rise in pre-tax profits to £92m as sales increased 44% to £1.2bn in the year to 29 February. The group – which owns PrettyLittleThing  Nasty Gal  Coast  Karen Millen and MissPap as well as the main Boohoo website – said sales had taken a hit after the government imposed restrictions on movement on 23 March  but had bounced back to better than last year’s levels in recent weeks. Boohoo said it could not provide profit guidance for the year ahead because of uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic  which might result in the closure of its warehouses at some point. But the company said it had a strong balance sheet  with £241m of cash at year end  and was “well-placed to … continue to disrupt fashion markets around the world”. Neil Catto  Boohoo’s finance director  said: “Our priority at the moment has been the wellbeing of our teams and coping with the crisis ” and added: “Our balance sheet is strong and we have the ability to look at opportunities to help other brands through the crisis. It is likely many opportunities will arise in the coming weeks and we will take a look at those and make an assessment on whether we can add value.” Catto declined to say whether Boohoo was looking at Oasis and Warehouse but it is likely to have a number of other options on offer. A host of fashion brands are under pressure  with TM Lewin and Office urgently seeking rescue deals and Debenhams and Laura Ashley in administration. Laura Ashley’s brand name was sold on Wednesday to restructuring specialist Gordon Brothers  but its stores and website remain in the hands of administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers  leaving 1669 currently furloughed jobs at risk. Carol Kane  the joint chief executive of Boohoo  said that during the lockdown shoppers had switched away from body-con dresses and evening outfits to athleisure wear such as hoodies  jogging pants and nightwear suited to time indoors. “It is more of a casual package ” she said. Kane said Boohoo had been able to quickly adapt its supply chain to difficulties such as the factory closures in China and the need for physical distancing in UK factories. “Our lead times are short and that has played to our benefit. Fabric that might have gone into one garment has been switched to another more appropriate to demand ” she said. The company said it was confident its warehouses were operating safely after introducing measures to ensure physical distancing. Boohoo has faced criticism from some workers and the Usdaw union about inadequate personal protection equipment and working practices. Usdaw says it did not ensure necessary physical distancing at its Burnley warehouse. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e12e95e05d00b96bbe81bd38330281ff01783d/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64ed2ce1ae1dd731837de84e9669626d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6128c8e72815684d37501b476b26676b51872fce/119_0_3533_2121/master/3533.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9b798b611fdecbd75a7dc7c70572f2d3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff1bb754a12cacf6db65607df31c8121c7a91ed/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b4755d528cfa0684de786154330e6e0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f2bf938166a74180beb9f881b01ea8a36ef2b3/0_0_3591_2154/master/3591.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b61c547bac80f4ab99b877079e5885d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8857715a28193f1aadf322dad4d36450889488ce/0_120_4095_2458/master/4095.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1642d54a60f3c3fba79c379899f42c0e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boohoo%2CRetail+industry%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CFashion%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/uk-inflation-falls-stay-away-shoppers-shun-spring-clothing-coronavirus,business, UK inflation falls to 1.5% as stay-away shoppers shun spring clothing, Coronavirus lockdown causes fashion prices to decline for only second time since 1988, Highlighting the economic fallout from the global health emergency  the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) fell to 1.5% last month  from 1.7% in February  driven down by clothing costs and the plummeting global oil price. Clothing and footwear prices  which typically rise between February and March as retailers gear up for the spring season  fell over the period for only the second time since comparable records began in 1988  with a slide of 0.3%. Although the ONS collected its price data around 17 March  before the formal government lockdown was introduced six days later  it said the rapidly escalating nature of the coronavirus outbreak at that time influenced sales patterns across Britain. The government statistics agency said a number of factors might have contributed to the change  including less browsing in physical stores  people spending more time at home  and a shift in spending towards other necessities such as food and cleaning products. Early surveys suggest the price of some high-demand products has risen sharply since the onset of the crisis. Laura Suter  a personal finance analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell  said: “With retailers having to shut their doors we’re seeing more and more offer discounts to shoppers to move their buying online. “In particular clothing and department stores have been hit  as people don’t need new outfits to sit on their sofa all day and are delaying large purchases amid worries about where the economy is headed.” Falling transport costs also dragged down inflation as the global price of oil fell in response to dwindling demand for crude as the pandemic intensified  and as Saudi Arabia and Russia entered a price war  refusing to cut output levels. As the global oil price dropped from more than $60 (£48) a barrel to around $20  prices at petrol and diesel pumps in Britain fell by more than 5p per litre between February and March. The ONS said demand also probably fell amid the onset of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19  including increased working from home and travel restrictions. Economists expect inflation to fall further in the coming months after US oil prices turned negative for the first time on record on Monday  amid the rapidly escalating economic fallout from the global health emergency. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a840ab90ff7e23d7aa4ebeeebb169217f36fb32/0_303_5040_3026/master/5040.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8fd74780c7b401703166c535693dc9da https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6d11312c8652c1abb1878441a08facef56d33/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6561f8d3342a9be902f597172aecaa69 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d437d9109afbcda7f59040ed23175b03f7925f55/0_336_4550_2732/master/4550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd6f3fc534e86d5a1bd9ef20497fb244 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Inflation%2CBusiness%2CEconomics%2CRetail+industry%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/weatherwatch-what-is-the-dew-point,environment, Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?, The dew point is the temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapour and for dew to form, Of course  dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent  condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature  instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets  it transitions directly to crystals of ice  in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common  surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air’s dew point  aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence  dew and frost do not form as readily  especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them  such as roads. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef19c8b09666cfbd5c3737ce6f90b57ecff0166/0_138_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a33841b7d2c2fa405f9141603e52bf4 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Environment https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/nurse-shortage-causes-nightingale-hospital-to-turn-away-patients,world, Nurse shortage causes Nightingale hospital to turn away patients, Exclusive: Covid-19 patient transfers to new London facility cancelled owing to lack of ICU nurses, The disclosure comes amid a growing belief among hospital management in the capital that the Nightingale  built to great acclaim over just nine days  was becoming a “white elephant”. The hospital has been unable to admit about 50 people with the disease and needing “life or death” care since its first patient arrived at the site  in the ExCeL exhibition centre  in London’s Docklands  on 7 April. Thirty of these people were rejected because of a lack of staff. The planned transfer of more than 30 patients from established London hospitals to the Nightingale was “cancelled due to staffing issues”  according to NHS documents seen by the Guardian. All the patients had been intubated and were on a ventilator because they were so unwell. The revelation raises questions about the role and future of the hospital  which up until Monday had only treated 41 patients  despite being designed to include almost 4 000 beds. That means that the hospital has rejected more patients  owing to a combination of understaffing and the patients’ health  than it has treated. Of those 41 patients  four have died  seven have been discharged to a less critical level of care  and the other 30 were still being cared for at the Nightingale. The hospital is being obliged to reject people needing care because it cannot get enough of the nurses usually based in other hospitals to work there  staff at the new facility claimed. One member of staff said: “There are plenty of people working here  including plenty of doctors. But there aren’t enough critical care nurses. They’re already working in other hospitals and being run ragged there. There aren’t spare people [specialist nurses] around to do this. That’s the problem. That leads to patients having to be rejected  because there aren’t enough critical care nurses.” Almost 20 other patients have been rejected by the Nightingale on medical grounds  for example because they were “too unwell to transfer” or had had a tube inserted into their throat to help them breathe  or because they did not meet the new hospital’s strict clinical admission criteria. The Nightingale  which was opened in a high-profile ceremony involving Prince Charles on 3 April  admitted its first patient on 7 April and rejected the planned transfer of a patients from another London hospital for the first time on 9 April. NHS England decided to create the hospital because they feared that within weeks hospitals in the capital would have been overwhelmed by the numbers of people needing intensive care. At the time the health secretary  Matt Hancock  said that the NHS was “preparing for the worst but hoping for the best”. One senior intensive care doctor said: “The Nightingale is clearly not a hospital. It’s an emergency overflow facility to ventilate patients to stop them from dying when hospitals have run out of space.” Sir David Sloman  head of the NHS in London  oversaw the project  in which the army was closely involved  and it was approved by Sir Simon Stevens  chief executive of NHS England  and the prime minister  Boris Johnson. Sloman wrote to NHS heads in London last Friday asking them to provide about 200 doctors and nurses so that the Nightingale could be used for a growing number of patients needing critical care and help established hospitals resume operations and preparations for the winter ahead. Despite this  the Nightingale’s inability to admit patients has left established London hospitals unable to relieve the pressure on their overcrowded intensive care units by transferring people suffering from the coronavirus. That has had the biggest impact on Northwick Park hospital  north-west London  which had to declare a “critical incident” and temporarily shut its doors to new admissions last month as the impact of the coronavirus worsened. It has been unable to transfer more than 30 patients to the Nightingale since 9 April  with many of those planned switches “cancelled due to staffing issues”  the documents show. The Royal Free hospital  in Camden  London  has also had to abandon plans to transfer about 15 patients from its ICU to the Nightingale. Again  that was often due to lack of staff. Other hospitals in the capital  including St Mary’s  the Royal London and North Middlesex  have also had transfers blocked. The Nightingale is already under intense scrutiny amid disagreements among NHS leaders and senior doctors in the capital over its purpose and whether or not it is a good use of resources. A senior official at a London trust said: “It’s a white elephant. When it was conceived a month ago we were facing the prospect of hospitals in London being overrun and mass burial sites like in New York. We thought that London would be Italy and there would be more patients needing level 3 intensive care treatment by this stage. “But the expected doubling every three days in the number of patients needing to be admitted to ICU didn’t happen. London hospitals doubled  tripled and in some cases quadrupled the capacity of their ICUs  so still have spare capacity  which means the Nightingale hasn’t been needed.” Other NHS planners said it was better to over-prepare for the pandemic. A senior intensive care doctor said: “ It was a sensible project designed to stave off the type of situation we saw in Italy. It may have just been a matter of days and we would have been thankful it existed. Thankfully  good surge planning to massively increase critical care capacity in hospitals  and a last ditch redistribution effort to move patients from stressed small hospitals to larger hospitals with space  has meant that we have not needed this type of facility.” Stevens echoed that view at the weekend  saying: “We have not yet had to make extensive use of the Nightingale London thanks to the hard work of NHS staff  who have freed up more than 30 000 existing hospital beds  and the public  who have played their part by staying at home and saving lives.” An NHS London spokesperson said: “The most important point about staff at the Nightingale is that thanks to their care and expertise  patients in that hospital are being successfully treated  discharged and ultimately having their life saved. “There remains spare capacity in the critical care network across the capital to look after all coronavirus patients and others who need our care  and while it is incredibly reassuring for both staff and patients to have backup capacity at the Nightingale to alleviate pressure on ICU departments where needed  patients can be transferred to other hospitals in the city if they are better placed to receive them at that time – as is always the case.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is misleading to suggest coronavirus patients are being turned away from NHS Nightingale due to a shortage of staff. “NHS Nightingale has been set up to treat patients if the NHS was overwhelmed but thanks to the great work of selfless NHS staff  there is spare capacity in existing London hospitals to treat all coronavirus patients there instead.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb55541c2778d4818773c20e6a5a88d2eb179c2/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=720f430c7f12f6e8832fa746f660694c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHospitals%2CNursing%2CMatt+Hancock%2CInfectious+diseases%2CEmergency+planning%2CNHS%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/government-misses-out-on-14m-facemasks-for-nhs-in-four-weeks,uk-news, Government misses out on 16m face masks for NHS in four weeks, Companies say their offers to supply much-needed PPE have been met with silence, As ministers faced relentless questions over a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals  suppliers said their offers to deliver UK-standard face masks were being met with silence from the government. And on another day of chaos over the government’s PPE procurement  a senior civil servant said that its decision to opt out of a joint EU scheme was politically motivated. However he was forced to retract his claim within hours after he was contradicted by the health secretary  Matt Hancock. Adding to the confusion  Hancock claimed that the UK had now joined the scheme – only for EU sources to note that the U-turn had happened recently so Britain would not benefit from the supplies of emergency equipment. As new figures revealed that care home fatalities had quadrupled over the last week and as another 823 deaths were announced  the government faced further acute pressure over difficulties securing protective gear for hospitals and care homes. These problems included: Of 8 000 companies so far offering PPE within the UK  the government has engaged with about 1 000 and is working with 159 manufacturers to bring the offered supplies into use. But many of those firms said that they had seen offers of rapidly available and certified equipment ignored. Volker Schuster  the owner of the Merseyside-based chemicals firm EcoLogix  said he wrote to the cabinet office’s “Covid commercial response unit” offering to supply 10m FFP2 masks for frontline medics that would be ready to ship from China within a week. He said he submitted details of the masks  including their European CE certification  but only received a substantive response eight days later – asking for details he had already provided. By that time the masks had been sold to other countries. Schuster’s MP  Bill Esterson  confirmed that he also contacted the office of the health secretary  Matt Hancock  to highlight the offer on 27 March but that he had never received a reply. Rachel Reeves  the shadow cabinet office minister  said on Tuesday she had been inundated by manufacturers who had contacted the government offering to make or supply PPE but that she had heard nothing back. Reeves also accused the government of prioritising “major fashion and clothing brands … over companies that may have been better placed to manufacture what is needed as quickly as possible”. Retailers including Burberry and Barbour announced collaborations with the government to help increase availability of PPE supplies. Hancock said in the televised Downing Street briefing that the government was accelerating its response to companies but that officials were having to filter out approaches from firms which were not credible. He said: “We’re always trying to improve the processes that we have in place to make purchases. We want to engage with all those companies who can help us in this national effort and we are accelerating the progress of getting back to all those companies with a substantive response. This is a fast-moving market. There is a global shortage … and that means we need to be as nimble as we possibly can.” The infectious disease specialists  Landcent  said it could have distributed 6m FFP2 face masks to the UK if the government had placed an order when it first submitted an offer three weeks ago. Arun Prabhu  Landcent’s co-founder  said its UK partner  EFDUK  had contacted the government at the end of March offering to supply face masks  testing kits and protective overalls. He said they received a reply expressing interest in face masks “three or four days later” but had heard nothing since. “By now we would have supplied close to 6m face masks ” he said  adding that the firm had already shipped millions of Ply surgical masks to Austria  Italy  Germany  the Netherlands and Sweden. Prabhu said Britain risked losing out to other countries unless it responded more quickly to credible offers. “There is a global demand but there is no lack of supplies – it’s just tapping into the right distributing partners. I would urge [the British government] to assign a special taskforce who are primarily focused towards procurement.” Both EcoLogix and Landcent said they submitted detailed information on the specification of their face masks and that these met the UK requirements and were CE approved  meaning they meet EU standards for health and safety. Esterson  the shadow minister for international trade  said the government’s “shambolic” response to credible offers to secure PPE was putting lives at risk from the coronavirus pandemic. He said: “It cannot be right that companies which can help with PPE and which have offered to help are facing long delays in hearing back from the government. People are dying and this needs to be simplified and speeded up.” Social care companies meanwhile were critical of the government’s plan allowing to them to use the NHS supply chain where commercial options failed. One group  Methodist Homes  called the system “not clear at all” and said that just two of the firm’s 131 sites had managed to order basic supplies. The Sue Ryder palliative care charity said it was in a diresituation  with all forms of PPE due to run out within days  and that it had not heard from the government that it could access the NHS supply chain. A government spokesperson said there had been more than 8 000 offers of support  adding: “We are working rapidly to get through these offers  ensuring they meet the safety and quality standards that our NHS and social care workers need  and prioritising offers of larger volumes.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d4d35643530cd603bf7cf335aa34f55f5d58b10/0_259_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e85a39037b7208939d9470767df4b0c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+news%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPolitics%2CNHS%2CCoronavirus+outbreak https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/boris-johnson-speak-to-donald-trump-queen-from-chequers-coronavirus,politics, Boris Johnson speaks to Donald Trump from Chequers, PM will have telephone audience with the Queen while he recovers from coronavirus, The prime minister spoke to the US president on Tuesday afternoon to “thank Trump for his good wishes while he was unwell”  but also took the opportunity to talk about the G7’s efforts to combat the virus and reaffirm his desire for a UK-US trade agreement. A Downing Street spokesman said: “The leaders agreed on the importance of a coordinated international response to coronavirus  including through the G7 – which the US currently chairs. They also discussed continued UK-US cooperation in the fight against the pandemic. The leaders committed to continue working together to strengthen our bilateral relationship  including by signing a free trade agreement as soon as possible.” The White House said the prime minister “shared that he is feeling better and on the road to recovery”. Johnson will also have a telephone audience with the Queen later this week  probably on Wednesday or Thursday  after missing several weeks because of his illness. The prime minister has also been making calls to government ministers as he seeks updates on the response to the virus  amid continuing criticism of the effort to get personal protective equipment to the NHS and care homes as well as the failure to ramp up testing to promised levels. His spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “The prime minister is continuing his recovery at Chequers and isn’t formally doing government work. “He has been receiving updates from No 10 on the coronavirus response and has spoken with the first secretary of state and senior members of his team. “Yesterday he sent a message of condolence to Justin Trudeau after the very sad loss of life in the shooting in Canada. “Later today  at around about 2pm  he will be speaking with President Trump.” Johnson went to Chequers to recuperate after spending a week in hospital  including three days in intensive care  when his breathing deteriorated. He has been off work for just over two weeks  with Dominic Raab  the foreign secretary and first secretary of state  deputising for him in the meantime. During his absence  there have been complaints of a power vacuum and criticism over key issues such as how the UK will eventually try to ease the lockdown. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce991ee27ac83c167d5f289cf15633c9a03947c7/0_88_8846_5309/master/8846.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cfce9196e3a05c24e0bf77f5e9acd03a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CInfectious+diseases%2CWorld+news%2CScience%2CPolitics%2CDonald+Trump%2CThe+Queen https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/21/tenants-told-to-use-lunch-and-holiday-savings-to-pay-full-rent,money, Tenants told to use lunch and holiday savings to pay full rent, London agent for billionaire landlord turns down residents’ request for coronavirus relief, More than 100 residents living in a block in Somerford Grove  east London  signed a letter addressed to their management estate agency and the building’s corporate landlords asking for a 20% reduction in rent and an agreement that no tenant would be evicted during the coronavirus pandemic. But the letting agent  Tower Quay properties  told them their request was “unreasonable” and “unrealistic”  adding that any drop in tenants’ income would be minimised by a reduction in spending on holidays  entertainment  travel  clothes and lunches. “Subsequently  when all of this is taken into account  in most cases we believe the impact on disposable income will be minimal  and there is therefore no justification for any reduction in rent  especially considering that whilst tenants are isolating the wear and tear in properties is increasing  which will be at the cost of the landlord ” the agent said. The agent also noted the recent support announced by the government  adding that the building’s commercial landlords did not speak directly to tenants and that all communication was to be with the agent. Tower Quay is the agent for 170 flats in Somerford Groveon behalf of the tenants’ corporate landlords. Most of the tenants who signed the letter have three corporate landlords that are also the freeholders: Simpson House 3  Reverie Estates SR Limited  and Somerford Assets 3. All three companies are majority owned by the billionaire property developer John Christodoulou. While Somerford Assets 3 is the freeholder for some flats at Olympic House on 12 Somerford Grove  the leaseholder for around a dozen of the tenants who signed the letter is Windermere Holdings Overseas SA  incorporated in the British Virgin Island. The owner of this company is not apparent. Christodoulou owns several properties and hotels across the UK and has appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List. There is no suggestion he was personally aware of the tenants’ request when it was initially made  or the agent’s response. Marc Sutton  41  one of the residents who signed the letter  said: “The letter was asking the landlords to work with us so we can keep as many people paying money as possible  even if it was at a reduced rate. We asked 20% for everyone because it seemed like almost everyone was losing work. Many residents are freelancers or doing multiple jobs in gig work.” While Tower Quay properties refused to negotiate with the tenancy association  the estate agent did respond to individual requests. Patrick Mcdowell  24  who owns a small sustainable fashion business  said he was told he could get a 20% rent reduction in May and June  but would be expected to pay his full rent plus 20% in July and August. “There was a clause in that agreement that said it was void if I told anybody else in the building about it ” he said. One tenant who had lost their job  and wished to remain anonymous  received the same offer after inquiring about a rent reduction. “I don’t know where they think I’m going to find a job in three months. Nobody is hiring. I just can’t believe they’re not willing to budge just an inch to try and help us out.” Kieran Kirkwood  a spokesperson for London Renters Union (LRU)  said: “Tower Quay’s suggestion that their tenants could be saving money on lunch and holidays in the midst of a global pandemic beggars belief. Many in the block  like renters everywhere  are seriously struggling to make ends meet. “This shows what the government’s pie in the sky strategy of relying on the ‘compassion’ of landlords and letting agents means in practice: landlords and letting agents keep profiting while their tenants are forced to choose between rent and food.” The LRU and other housing campaigners across the country have called on the government to suspend all rent payments and waive all arrears until the pandemic is over. Kirkwood said failure to do so would result in an “unprecedented crisis of poverty  evictions and homelessness”. A Tower Quay spokesperson said tenants were being supported on an individual level and that it was clear there were residents who could still pay their rent. “It is also not feasible for a single landlord to simply offer all concessions to all tenants whilst there is no support being offered by the government to landlords to assist this.” The spokesperson apologised if tenants thought remarks on money saved on lunches and cancelled holidays were insensitive  but added: “Based on discussions with other tenants we believe  in good faith  that these comments are true.” Tower Quay said each property has separate corporate landlords and none have a landlord who is an individual. John Christodoulou did not respond to a request for a comment. It is understood he was not consulted personally by Tower Quay about the residents’ requests. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9454a6fabbf5068d83bd662723766e9b2ab502/0_261_7819_4692/master/7819.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf1daf46ef6b7268d950c81f288222fd https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Renting+property%2CHousing%2CProperty%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CConsumer+affairs%2CConsumer+rights%2CMoney%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/21/philip-pullman-ministers-should-face-charges-if-brexit-politics-slowed-ppe,books, Philip Pullman: ministers should face charges if Brexit politics slowed PPE, Novelist says government should be ‘charged with conspiracy to murder’ if reluctance to work with the EU obstructed provision, The government has previously said it was unable to join the EU schemes as it had not received an email of invitation. But the Guardian revealed last week that the UK missed three opportunities to be part of the EU scheme to bulk-buy masks  gowns and gloves. In a bitingly critical essay published by Penguin  the author of His Dark Materials says the entire front bench should resign if it is found to be true that MPs declined to participate “for Brexit-related reasons”. But Pullman predicted that no resignations would follow because the MPs responsible “have not a single grain of shame”. “So they should be arraigned on charges of conspiracy to murder. Nothing less will do. They knew the risks  and thought they’d rather appease the foaming zealots of Brexit ” writes the novelist  who has described Brexit as a catastrophe in the past. The essay says that the profound change of circumstances means we should now hold back on leaving the EU. “There are so many clear advantages to being in the EU  and the benefits of leaving are so tenuous and fanciful  that we must revisit the referendum and hope that this time the Labour party under a new leader will play a proper part in the argument; and that the lies  the cheating  the flagrant and shameless mendacity will be fully exposed by a strong  passionate  and focused campaign to remain ” says Pullman. A long-time critic of the Conservative government  Pullman lays out his belief that “we must burn out the old corruption and establish a better way of living together”. “It’s all got to change ” he writes. “If we come out of this crisis with all the rickety  fly-blown  worm-eaten old structures still intact  the same vain and indolent public schoolboys in charge  the same hedge fund managers stuffing their overloaded pockets with greasy fingers  our descendants will not forgive us.” The essay is part of a new series from Penguin authors  Perspectives  offering their responses to Covid-19. Philosopher AC Grayling has written about how the philosophy of the Stoics can guide us through the crisis  Holocaust survivor Edith Eger on how we can find strength in the midst of it  and Malorie Blackman on how the pandemic should lead us to a fairer society. Penguin says the series is intended to follow in the spirit of its founder Allen Lane  who set up the publisher in 1935 “to ensure everyone had access to the greatest minds  stories and ideas through affordable and high quality books”. “No more important is this than in times of unprecedented crisis ” the publisher said. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7b9e5ea52ad8c88966758b15e8258e652fbec86/929_429_4232_2539/master/4232.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7e713c7aba44a6162897b765d9aaffc https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Philip+Pullman%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CPenguin%2CPublishing%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/uk-refusal-of-eu-ventilator-offer-was-political-decision,world, Matt Hancock forced to deny ‘political’ opt-out from EU ventilators, Senior Foreign Office official tells MPs that ministers refused scheme because UK had left EU, Following comments to a select committee by the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary  Sir Simon McDonald  Hancock used Downing Street’s daily press briefing to rebut the damaging claims which risk accusations that ministers have put Brexit ideology ahead of people’s lives. “I have spoken to the foreign secretary ” Hancock said an hour after McDonald’s remarks  which he retracted on Tuesday night. “As far as I’m aware there was no political decision not to participate. “We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.” However  a spokesman for the European commission swiftly rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU’s efforts to buy masks  gowns  ventilators or laboratory supplies. “They are most welcome to participate in future rounds ” the spokesman said. The EU launched four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment  ventilators and laboratory supplies in late February and March. UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March – after the bulk purchases had been made. When Downing Street has previously been questioned about the lack of involvement  officials and ministers have said the government failed to take part in the schemes because “owing to an initial communication problem  the UK did not receive an invitation in time”. But when asked on Tuesday by the chair of the foreign affairs select committee  Tom Tugendhat  whether there had been policy advice on whether to participate in the EU ventilator scheme  the FCO’s most senior mandarin appeared to contradict the government line. McDonald told the committee: “It was a political decision. The UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available  what was on offer  and the decision is known.” His remarks appeared to blow a hole in the original defence of a “communication confusion” previously put forward by the Cabinet Office minister  Michael Gove. McDonald had earlier been asked by the Labour MP Chris Bryant: “Why oh why did we not take part in the EU ventilator procurement scheme?” He replied: “The UK declined to participate because we left the European Union on 31 January.” Bryant replied: “No  we were invited to take part apparently  we missed the emails or forgot the emails.” At this point McDonald insisted that ministers had been fully briefed. In a “clarificatory” letter to the foreign affairs select committee on Tuesday night  McDonald said that unfortunately due to a misunderstanding he had mistakenly and wrongly told the committee that a political decision had been taken not to be involved in the EU joint procurement scheme. He wrote: “Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate. Owing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join four EU joint Covid joint procurement schemes. As these four initial schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part.” Hancock’s claim to have given the green light to joining the procurement scheme appeared to be a reference to the belated decision on 19 March to be represented on the key committee making the orders of equipment. He told reporters at the daily press briefing that he did not believe that any equipment under the EU scheme had yet been delivered. EU sources said they expected the first deliveries of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) worth of protective gear within days. McDonald’s claim that he made an error in giving evidence to the committee is remarkable  given that he is the senior civil servant responsible for handling UK relations with the EU  and the controversy over UK involvement in the EU medical schemes had been widely aired in the media. At the end of his evidence session McDonald had also taken the chance to correct a separate minor error in his evidence  but clearly had been given no guidance that he had wrongly briefed the select committee over the EU medical equipment schemes since he made no attempt to correct the record. Speaking after the hearing  Bryant said he had been shocked by McDonald’s answer  adding: “It seems that not content with refusing to take part in a mass EU purchase of desperately needed vital equipment out of a fit of Eurosceptic pique  the government has repeatedly told fibs in a sad attempt to cover its tracks.” He added: “It beggars belief that they deliberately  intentionally  with forethought and against advice  decided not to take part. And that they trotted out every excuse in the book when they realised they had messed up.” McDonald also spoke to the committee about the end of the transition period for the UK to leave the EU at the end of the year  apparently raising the possibility that Boris Johnson would consider in the next few weeks whether to go for an extension of the deadline. However  he then seemed to step back from the startling suggestion  saying he was stressing the theoretical possibilities  and adding that he believed the prime minister would confirm the existing timetable. Commenting on conversations with the US following Donald Trump’s decision to suspend payments to the World Health Organization  McDonald said: “It is clear that they think the WHO is overloaded and there needs to be a separate space for pandemics.” McDonald also said an “unacceptably large number of British people” stranded overseas had felt let down by the calibre of aid provided by the FCO. He conceded that cost-saving had driven the decision to require British nationals to use commercial as opposed to chartered flights to return home  but said the decision was good and defensible. He accepted the FCO had not initially been equipped at its central call centre to help Britons stranded abroad. But he insisted the department had received more praise than criticism for its efforts  by a margin of 20 to one. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff67175da616b031b9e0dca99528a433ee024525/786_1071_5318_3190/master/5318.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75386d4206df6b62fe26f6d23bc20be2 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CConservatives%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CHealth+policy%2CEuropean+Union%2CHealth%2CPolitics%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/turkish-ppe-flight-only-slim-chance-goods-will-arrive-in-uk-today,world, Turkish PPE finally arrives at Istanbul airport en route to UK, Ministers first promised delivery of much-needed equipment for NHS on Sunday, Ministers promised the shipment  which is supposed to include 400 000 protective gowns  would arrive in the UK on Sunday and again on Monday  but the supplies only started clearing Turkish customs late on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear if the medical equipment amounted to all the 84 tonnes ordered. Only one RAF plane out of a total transport of three cargo carriers was waiting on the tarmac at Istanbul to pick up the kit. The earliest the first shipment could arrive would be the early hours of Wednesday. Two more planes remained at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire ready to fly to Turkey if the remaining supplies become available. Turkey insisted that it was not responsible for the hold-ups  with sources adding that some export permissions were sought by the UK as late as Monday – after UK ministers had made repeated public statements saying the shipment was imminent. Ümit Yalç?n  Turkey’s ambassador to the UK  said: “Turkey did not delay anything. There is no responsibility for the Turkish government for the delay of this shipment. Whenever we received any request for help  we did our best to allow this shipment to go ahead.” One Whitehall source claimed that while health officials had placed the order  it had not been appreciated that – like many other countries – Turkey had placed extra restrictions on the export of medical equipment as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Ministers have been giving what turned out to be false assurances that the equipment was due to arrive in the UK imminently since the weekend  prompting complaints from NHS bosses that they were inflating public hopes at a time when PPE shortages in hospitals is acute. The health service is currently using 150 000 gowns a day. On Saturday  Robert Jenrick  the communities secretary announced at the daily Downing Street press conference that the consignment would arrive the following day  even though necessary clearances had not been sought. On Sunday  Gavin Williamson  the education secretary  said he hoped the shipment would arrive the next day. That promise was tentatively repeated by Oliver Dowden  the culture secretary  on Monday morning. “I don’t want to start making more and more promises  but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered ” Dowden said. But on Tuesday  the government finally adopted a more cautious tone. Simon Clarke  the local government minister  said the consignment would be in the UK “in the next few days”. Such was the UK’s desperation to expedite the order that one RAF plane  an Atlas A400M transport  was sent to Istanbul late on Monday in a desperate attempt to apply pressure on Turkey to hasten the export approval process. Turkey has already dispatched two other consignments of PPE to the UK this year. Earlier in April 250 000 items of PPE arrived in the UK from the country  including 100 000 protective gowns. But Ankara has been accused of holding up exports to other European countries  including to Italy  Spain and Belgium this month  often leading to high-level diplomatic intervention to secure the supply. Downing Street blamed an “unprecedented demand for PPE globally” for some of the difficulties faced by the UK and other countries. “There are challenges in the supply of PPE  there have been problems in ensuring that PPE gets to the right place at the right time ” the prime minister’s spokesman acknowledged.   , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a20829f1fab70e04dcb1d816453a74066d213f0/0_22_3519_2112/master/3519.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=697f435bebfb9a7082483c726dfd08b7 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CTurkey%2CNHS%2CMilitary%2CForeign+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/scientists-join-calls-for-uk-public-to-wear-homemade-face-masks-outdoors,politics, Scientists join calls for UK public to wear homemade face masks outdoors, Old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper enough to help reduce spread of coronavirus, Prof Sian Griffiths  who led the Hong Kong government’s investigation into the 2003 Sars epidemic  said Britain should adopt the same approach as the US  where people are advised to make their own “cloth face coverings” and wear them in public spaces. Trish Greenhalgh  a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University who recently completed a review on face masks  also advocated the use of masks in public and suggested an old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper would suffice. The US policy is being directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to reduce at least some transmission of the virus while preventing a run on medical-grade masks needed by frontline health workers. “The CDC advice in the US is pragmatic ” Griffiths said. “It recognises both the need to ensure the supply of masks for clinical situations where they are obviously needed at the same time as recognising that there could potentially be benefits in wearing ‘masks’ in public to prevent passing on the infection.” The government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) met on Tuesday to review the evidence on wearing face masks. The Guardian understands that the group is split on the best policy to adopt because the evidence is so weak. Ministers are deeply reluctant to recommend the use of even homemade masks amid concerns that people will rush to buy medical masks and leave the NHS facing even greater supply shortages. Asked about potential changes to the advice on the face masks  Matt Hancock  the health secretary  said at the daily No 10 press conference that ministers would be “guided by the science as always”. Speaking at the briefing  Professor Jonathan Van-Tham  England’s deputy chief medical officer  said advice from Sage would be passed on to ministers. But he stressed there was “an absolute enduring principle” not to jeopardise supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health and social care workers  adding: “that is a line that we are not going to cross under any circumstances.” Public Health England recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that while masks can help prevent people from passing on coronavirus  they are inadequate protection on their own from contracting it. Greenhalgh  on the back of a review on face masks  said homemade versions could dramatically reduce the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths  which can carry the virus if the person is infected. “We should be covering our faces with homespun materials like cotton. Medical-grade masks are scratchy and uncomfortable. Your old T-shirt is soft and nice  and with a couple of layers of kitchen paper inside a double layer  it will reduce the droplets coming out of your mouth and nose by about 95% ” she said. She added: “The public should not and must not divert medical-grade supplies.” There is growing unease over the government’s reluctance to recommend the use of face masks. Doctors across the UK have now backed the Masks4AllUK movement  which argues that people should wear homemade masks when they go out. At a press conference on Friday  the government’s chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  said that while Sage would look at the evidence  it was “absolutely crucial” that masks were available in hospitals and other high-risk transmission areas. Chris Hopson  the chief executive of NHS Providers  which represents healthcare trusts across England  said the impact on the NHS must be fully assessed. “Fluid-repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus ” he said. “Securing the supply of masks  when there is huge global demand  is crucial. This must be a key consideration for government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks  along with other measures  will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.” Prof David Heymann  of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  who chairs an independent advisory group to the WHO emergencies programme that is managing the Covid-19 pandemic  said the purpose of wearing face masks was to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus if they were infected themselves. “Masks should not be worn by the general public to protect themselves as there is evidence that masks do not prevent infection by other respiratory infections such as flu ” he said. “The best way that the general public can support government policy is to understand how to protect themselves and protect others if they are sick or believe they may be infected. This is by physical distancing  social distancing and frequent handwashing.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0c704430ee89c0e28770123134f8eaf451a5e4f/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d31173f26fcfa4aaf1ee43fa827011a7 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health+policy%2CHealth%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths,sport, Experts call for inquiry into local death toll after Cheltenham Festival, Fears that coronavirus deaths rose as a result of racing event going ahead in March, Mortality figures compiled by the Health Service Journal show that Gloucestershire hospitals NHS trust  which covers Cheltenham  has recorded 125 deaths  roughly double that in two nearby trusts at Bristol (58 each)  and those covering Swindon (67) and Bath (46). The trust declined to comment on the data  while senior officials at Gloucestershire council said there were “many factors” that could have influenced the death totals and comparisons between trusts in the west of England were “not possible”. But Prof John Ashton  a former director of public health for Cumbria  said the figures “deserve to be properly investigated. We know the Festival went ahead and a lot of people will have attended and worked there. It’s important we learn about what the potential is for coronavirus transmission at public events”. At Monday’s daily coronavirus press conference  Angela McLean  the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser  said there should be an investigation into the epidemiological consequences of another March sporting event  the Champions League tie at Anfield between Liverpool and Atlético Madrid. “I think it would be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the viruses that have circulated in Liverpool and the viruses that have circulated in Spain ” she said. The Cheltenham Festival is one of the highlights of the racing calendar. This year’s event  from 10-13 March  was attended  organisers say  by 125 000 people often in packed stands  just as awareness of the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis was emerging. On 16 March  fresh modelling from Imperial College prompted an emergency rethink on how to deal with coronavirus and the lockdown began on 23 March. But questions have been raised about whether the UK should have acted sooner. Ministers encouraged Cheltenham’s organisers to go ahead – a decision that was again defended by the culture secretary  Oliver Dowden  as recently as Monday morning. “The risk at mass gatherings was no greater or less than it would have been in pubs or restaurants  and the advice at that point was that we did not need to ban mass gatherings ” he said. Opposition councillors in Gloucestershire county council  which is run by the Conservatives  said they want to ask public health officials further questions this week. Paul Hodgkinson  the council’s Lib Dem group leader  said: “I think it is concerning. Gloucester and Cheltenham has been described as a hotspot in the south-west. “I’ve asked the question why. I don’t think there is a definitive answer. There perhaps never can be. People are asking out loud whether the number of deaths is connected to the festival. We know anecdotally that some people who attended became ill.” All queries to Gloucestershire NHS trust were forwarded to Gloucestershire council  which is responsible for public health. Sarah Scott  Gloucestershire’s director of public health  responded to questions about the impact of the festival on local death rates with caution. “There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in an area  including population density  age and health profile and the position of an area on the pandemic curve. It is also not possible to make comparisons between hospital trusts across the region as they all serve populations of differing size and characteristics ” she said. There have been anecdotal reports of people who attended Cheltenham falling ill with coronavirus symptoms  including Andrew Parker Bowles  the former husband of the Duchess of Cornwall  the comedian Lee Mack and the footballer Charlie Austin. One attendee  David Hodgkiss  71  the Lancashire county cricket club chairman  died of the disease in early April. But there is no firm evidence to suggest he or any of the others caught coronavirus at the race meeting. Dr Andrew Preston  a reader in microbial pathogenesis from the Milner centre for evolution at the University of Bath  said the lack of community testing and tracing meant it may never be possible to know whether Cheltenham contributed to the spread of Covid-19. But he said the mortality figures for Gloucestershire hospitals NHS trust raised questions. “If you look at the numbers by dates there is a general pickup over time  that is what has been seen nationally  but that appears to be greater for Gloucester than elsewhere in the region. “This does coincide with around two weeks after Cheltenham  which puts this in the right time frame for these infections at around the time of the festival.” The Jockey Club  which organises the premier event in the National Hunt calendar  declined to comment. Most racing professionals living in the Cheltenham area have consistently defended the decision to go ahead with the festival. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd89bcfa91ef4145b8a77ccb612f23ea5bd802d6/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2016d6aaaa60ac99e0076e0b6da2e66c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Cheltenham+Festival+2020%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CPolitics%2CHealth%2CUK+news%2CPublic+services+policy%2CSociety%2CCheltenham+Festival%2CHorse+racing%2CSport https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/failure-to-protect-who-is-to-blame-for-britains-coronavirus-crisis,world, Failure to protect: who is to blame for Britain's coronavirus crisis?, A number of prominent people are being criticised for their shortcomings over Covid-19, So who is in the line of fire – and why? Before he became prime minister  Johnson was accused of being too casual and not having a grip on detail  particularly when he was foreign secretary. This week it emerged he had failed to attend five high security Cobra meetings during January and February that were held to prepare for a possible pandemic. The allegation was published by the Sunday Times and later confirmed by Michael Gove. During this period  Johnson went on country breaks with his pregnant fiancee – fuelling concerns that he hadn’t take the threat seriously enough at an early stage. Those fears hardened after it emerged that on 3 February  he claimed the UK was ready to be a free trade “superhero” fighting against those who wished to put up trade barriers to stop diseases such as coronavirus. Stung by the claims  the government issued a long defence of Johnson’s handling of the crisis and said the Sunday Times was guilty of “a series of falsehoods and errors”. Gove said it was not unusual for other ministers to chair Cobra meetings. No other minster has been under more pressure than Hancock  who has been accused of boasting too much  and delivering too little – particularly on testing the delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS workers. His commitment to roll out 100 000 tests a day by the end of April looked overly ambitious when he made it earlier this month – and with only a week to go  the target looks unreachable. Although the UK has the capacity to do around 40 000 a day – the actual number of tests undertaken stood at 18 206 on Tuesday. The boast will also “come back to bite him” according to one Downing Street insider who was quoted in the Daily Telegraph. Ventilator procurement has also been another high-profile issue for Hancock. He has said the UK needs 18 000 machines – but so far  there are only 10 700 in action. Critics say he has focused on big name brands such as Dyson producing them from scratch  rather than helping pre-existing British ventilator manufacturers increase supply. On 3 April he boasted of firms making PPE domestically and gave a “shout out to Burberry” for their offer to help. Weeks later Hancock admitted they were “tight on gowns”  and British companies have repeatedly complained that their approaches to government have not been taken up  with reports on Monday of some firms sending shipments of equipment abroad. Both won high praise for their calm handling of the crisis during its early days  but their roles have come under increased scrutiny – not least because ministers keep insisting they have taken decisions based on the advice that they are being given by them. Critics of the government will say ministers cannot duck responsibility for taking key decisions – but there is undoubtedly huge pressure on Vallance  Whitty and the teams around them. The concept of herd immunity was first raised publicly by Vallance on 13 March with a comment that it could be an “important part of controlling [coronavirus] longer term”. His remark sparked alarm among the public as the UK continued to allow mass gatherings  while European neighbours were banning sports fixtures and closing schools. The phrase was quickly shot down by Hancock who said it was not a “goal or a strategy” of the government. A few days later  a scientific report was released by Imperial College London’s Covid-19 response team that stated that without urgent and aggressive suppression measures  up to 250 000 people could die. Whitty has already conceded Germany “got ahead” in testing people for Covid-19 and said the UK needed to learn from that as it races to set up diagnostic facilities from scratch. The cabinet secretary’s role at the centre of government is pivotal – Sedwill is the national security adviser  head of the civil service and it fell to him to tell the cabinet that Johnson had been taken into intensive care. It has made him a target of sniping from unnamed government aides over a number of weeks. Sources have claimed in the Times and the Sunday Times that he failed to get a grip on the coronavirus crisis in February; one  quoted in the Financial Times  even claimed that he had fallen out with Johnson and his aides over the response to the virus. Cabinet Office insiders have hit back  calling the claims “shit-stirring” and a move towards blaming civil servants who cannot speak out. Sedwill  who has enemies among Johnson’s advisers and in the cabinet  is unlikely to accept any attempt to shift the blame without a fight. In the wake of Donald Trump’s attempts to characterise Covid-19 as the “Chinese disease”  several government ministers have sought to highlight the regime’s failings in tackling the disease in December and January. When under pressure for a lack of testing in the UK  Michael Gove appeared to lay the blame for the UK’s lack of readiness for coronavirus upon China. “Some of the reporting from China was not clear about the scale  the nature  the infectiousness of this ” he said. His comments followed Downing Street briefings claiming that ministers expect a “reckoning” with China over misinformation – UK scientists claimed the number of deaths in China could be 40 times greater than officially reported  while Chinese doctors who tried to blow the whistle were silenced. Many scientists have pointed out that China voluntarily shared the genetic code of the virus very quickly  allowing countries to start making diagnostic tests and working on vaccines. The UN agency  which is responsible for sounding the global alarm during outbreaks of major diseases  has been accused by Trump of failing to test China’s claims and repeatedly praising the communist government for its response. Downing Street joined in the criticism  saying the WHO’s response to the outbreak of the pandemic in China showed there was room for it to “improve its response” to such emergencies. Whille Trump has withdrawn funding to the WHO  No 10 has said it will not follow his lead and would continue to fund the body  having already given it £75m to fight the virus. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ea253202723081db93cb7c52d3932d4449f716/0_43_3288_1973/master/3288.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=656aa7a3ab32a1e247df819d79830f3c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e25e22c1712ecf81d9b197dd33f6615a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bae4bff1b81eb2afae5fe63ee5914ba929bbfa9/0_34_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b1e05d03d7886967c1b90678be1939c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab8040f6f49cbda8ae5cf716b0aeee1ff54bc24/0_203_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ee5fa0b38d5248eb3560b0fbfb394aa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ba134143a69cefe6e6dfc0ce88349ae86eaf04/0_157_4995_2997/master/4995.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c5cc9e3eb2b922e830708ae23d5054 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2545501fb03a28ff0a8d1a293283c60dd475f5bc/0_100_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40b93b361b6aa5ed9b8071c54278edac https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CHealth+policy%2CBoris+Johnson%2CMatt+Hancock%2CPatrick+Vallance%2CChris+Whitty%2CChina%2CWorld+Health+Organization%2CAsia+Pacific%2CInfectious+diseases%2CMedical+research%2CHealth%2CCivil+service https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/downing-street-defends-hancock-as-blame-game-starts-over-ppe-shortages,politics, Downing Street defends Hancock as blame game starts over PPE shortages, Prime minister has ‘full confidence’ in health secretary despite testing and equipment shortages, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said the prime minister has full confidence in Hancock and stands behind his pledge to get the UK to 100 000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April  despite only 19 000 being carried out on Monday. However  a blame game has started in Whitehall about some of the problems that have dogged the government’s reaction to the Covid-19 crisis  with Hancock’s handling of the logistics around testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) under the spotlight. At the same time  some government sources have been pointing the finger at Public Health England for its sluggishness in increasing testing  and the NHS for failing to refer enough staff  which means completed tests are well below capacity of more than 39 000. With recriminations flying  Ed Davey  the acting Lib Dem leader  became the first politician to call for a judge-led public inquiry into the government’s actions after the pandemic is over  saying it “must have the strongest possible powers given the shocking failures on protective equipment for staff and the slow response of the government – to get to the truth and to give Boris Johnson the opportunity to answer the increasingly serious questions.” Tensions spilled into the open on Monday when an anonymous insider close to Downing Street told the Telegraph that Hancock’s 100 000 testing target was “made up”  and was an arbitrary figure that would “come back to bite him”. However  Johnson’s spokesman said: “An insider close to Downing Street is a new one on me. Whoever they are  and it could be anyone given that description  they are wrong.” He added: “We’ve said throughout that is a government target. We are working hard to hit it.” Johnson has previously set a target of 250 000 tests a day  without putting a date on it. A cabinet source said Hancock may have irritated some in No 10 and there had been tensions between him and Michael Gove  the Cabinet Office minister  in the “quad” of decision-making. But they questioned whether Downing Street would seek to make Hancock a scapegoat at such a crucial time  when he has such an important role in coordinating the government’s health response to the pandemic. Hancock also received backing from an unlikely source – one of his Labour predecessors  Andy Burnham  who is mayor of Greater Manchester. “I don’t agree with everything Matt Hancock has done but he has called some things right and I am certain he’s working flat out right now in the PM’s absence. With that in mind  this is an appalling move by Downing Street. It helps no one. Whoever’s responsible should be ashamed ” he said. Hancock  speaking at No 10’s daily press briefing  defended the UK’s response – and by extension his handling of the health department – saying the international comparisons about the spread of infections should take into account the size of the country. “At the start of this crisis  we said there were two absolutely critical tasks that formed part of the battle plan. One is that we got the exponential spread of this under control and brought the curve down. As you can see  that curve is now flat and that means we have achieved that objective ” he said. “The second thing we said is that we must do everything we can to make sure the NHS is not overwhelmed. We have achieved that because every single person who has needed treatment has been able to get that treatment … On those two core measures  the plan is working. “Does it mean every problem has been addressed? No of course not. I’ve gone through some of the details on PPE  where there are clearly challenges … But on the absolutely central core objectives  thanks to the work of the NHS  armed forces and many others  and people who have stayed at home  we have managed to bend down the curve and ensured NHS capacity is there.” He said he and his officials were looking every day at “how do you learn from where things are going well and where things aren’t going so well ... we are constantly looking around the world at these comparisons”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f667a94149c3a978c4f8257157dd0bd064dbfdf5/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52a6c0621eb6ffe07451b25dfc017267 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Matt+Hancock%2CPolitics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CNHS https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/virtual-house-of-lords-sittings-will-not-be-broadcast-live,politics, Virtual House of Lords sittings will not be broadcast live, Move is criticised as ‘unacceptable’ by some peers as chamber opts to use Microsoft video-conferencing, Some peers said the decision to run parliament in this manner was “unacceptable”  after it emerged that sessions will effectively be held in private for an initial two-week period. While the House of Commons was using Zoom and broadcasting proceedings live  the Lords has been equipped with Microsoft Teams  with peers blaming technical limitations for the decision. The Lords’ Conservative chief whip  Lord Hyde  said the upper house would only use Zoom when it is was secure  raising questions over why the Commons was able to roll out use of the programme to 650 MPs. He said that the public would be able to follow proceedings in the Lords by reading Hansard  the official written record of what is said in the chamber  which is available online within a few hours of a debate finishing. Television broadcasters are also understood to have raised concerns about the lack of footage. Labour’s Lord Adonis led the criticism in the chamber as a handful of peers observing social-distancing rules returned in person after the Easter recess. He said: “It will not be possible for the public to observe what’s going on  which is a breach of all precedent in terms of parliamentary proceedings and is a matter of very great concern.” He added: “If we were using Zoom  as the House of Commons is  then it would be possible to broadcast proceedings. If that is the case  what is the mechanism by which broadcasting will be possible within a fortnight’s time  presuming that is the intention? For anything other than a very short period of time while technical difficulties are sorted out it is absolutely unacceptable that the proceedings of this house are not broadcast.” Lord Hyde agreed that it would have been “nice” if the Lords was able to broadcast its virtual proceedings but the Commons was the immediate focus of parliament’s digital capabilities. “There is only limited amount of resource that the parliamentary digital service has got and they are  I think it’s fair to say  concentrating on the House of Commons and they are able to broadcast. I think it’s reasonable that in the absence of as many resources that we want that we should focus on the elected house.” The Commons speaker  Lindsay Hoyle  told the BBC that the new technology was a trial for both houses and it would be interesting to see “which system works best”. Lord Fowler added that they were going to look at moving to Zoom in the coming days. Peers have also come under fire for reports that members are keen to claim their £323 daily allowance while they are logging into virtual parliamentary sessions. The Lords’ speaker  Lord Fowler  told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the daily stipend was being considered and acknowledged the “pretty strong argument” for a reduced fee while they do not need to leave their homes. Virtual working arrangements for parliament also bring new challenges. Labour’s Valerie Vaz told the Commons that MPs would be expected to wear formal clothes while appearing on camera  with one key clarification: “The dress code will only apply to the top half.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395c6752194cdf7305e8c035c1b4f6a687c1af21/0_92_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55c461663f885419d5218d366fa66e4e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=House+of+Lords%2CPolitics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CZoom%2CTechnology https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/no-votes-no-tough-questions-mps-struggle-with-life-after-lockdown,politics, No votes  no tough questions: MPs struggle with life after lockdown, Even a Channel 5 gameshow has better procedures than the Commons on its first day back, You could tell we were in trouble right from the off as it was Jacob Rees-Mogg who was easily the most enthusiastic moderniser in the Commons. What he was proposing all seemed entirely sensible. Not to mention straightforward. Fifty MPs in the house at any one time  with another 120 logging in online. No tricky votes for at least a week as no one had yet worked out how to make the system work. FFS. Even a Channel 5 gameshow has a secure audience voting system. And if we were still members of the EU  we could have got some guidance from them as the Brussels parliament has been using an online voting system for years. But that ship has long since sailed. The shadow leader of the Commons  Valerie Vaz  was about the only person willing to embrace the new normal. Everyone else was more concerned about having ancient privileges taken away from them in perpetuity. The DUP’s Ian Paisley Jr and Jim Shannon were most exercised that the Commons might use its new regime to sneak through a vote allowing abortion in Northern Ireland. The situation cried out for someone to stand up and shout: “We’re in the middle of a global pandemic that’s killing thousands of people every day. So stop arsing about and being so bloody precious. No one’s trying to rewrite the rulebook for good. We’re just trying to muddle through and hold the government to account as best they can.” After more than an hour of pointless nitpicking  the few dozen MPs in the chamber grudgingly nodded the new measures through. And then promptly went home. There was no time to ask the government any tricky questions like the future. Best to break off for tea before watching the daily Downing Street press briefing instead. Today’s government frontman was Matt Hancock  who throughout looked to be on the verge of tears  his voice catching with emotion. Normally the health secretary is a walking  talking Tigger  bouncing with man-child optimism in the face of any impending catastrophe. But now he was utterly subdued. Broken  even. And well he might be. The vague sense of a collegiate cabinet truce that had appeared in place when Boris Johnson first fell ill is well and truly over. Since Dominic Cummings came back to work  the knives are out to find a scapegoat for when the coronavirus reckoning inevitably comes. And the blades are all pointing in Matt’s back. Classic Dom. Screw things up and get someone else to take the blame. Part of Hancock’s tragedy is that he is the architect of his own downfall. While other ministers seek to shift the blame and keep things vague  there is an intrinsic goodness and honesty to Matt. He does really care. Out of a dried-out riverbed of talent at the head of government  he is the closest we have got to a politician of integrity. It’s just that he’s not always as competent as he might be. Desperate to provide some hope and answers in a political vacuum of self-distancing from accountability. So he writes cheques he knows can’t be cashed. He makes promises that can’t be kept. There isn’t a prayer that the arbitrary target of 100 000 tests per day he ad libbed a few weeks ago will be met  so this is the cross on which the Grand Inquisitor  Classic Dom  will crucify him. With all this going on  the press briefing was understandably a car crash. With scattered parts all over the place. He promised that anyone who needed a hospital bed would get one. He just couldn’t guarantee that any of the doctors or nurses would have the necessary personal protective equipment to treat them. The transport plane that’s gone missing in Istanbul is now being written in as a character in the latest Dan Brown romp. Matt did also say that the first vaccine would be trialled on a person this coming Thursday. “But ” said the Anti-Tigger. But the science was very uncertain and so people shouldn’t get their hopes up too much. This from a minister who has consistently trotted out the party line that the science was always 100% accurate and that every decision had been taken in line with scientific advice. Hancock was in freefall  visibly being pulled in two different directions. His centre can no longer hold. Most questions focused on the evidence that Simon McDonald  the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office  had given to a select committee that afternoon. Namely that Michael Gove’s assertion that the UK’s failure to join the EU procurement programme had been an email administrative error was total bollocks. It had been a political decision all along. Who would have guessed the Govester had been caught out lying again? Hancock  though  was adamant. As health secretary he had definitely signed up to the EU programme. Leaving open the possibility that he had been overruled by Boris  Gove or Dominic Raab. Hell  if he was going down he might as well take some of the real guilty parties down with him. For the first time during the briefing  a ghost of a smile crossed his lips. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd4973e824d2ebd6890387ff30480741022bff6c/0_24_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=97d10a84bd9c53a376ec23bc66a3674b https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=House+of+Commons%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CJacob+Rees-Mogg%2CMatt+Hancock%2CHealth+policy https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/21/just-5-of-vulnerable-children-were-in-school-in-england-last-week,education, Just 5% of vulnerable children were in school in England last week, DfE figures confirm anecdotal reports pupils given emergency places are not turning up, Just 24 000 pupils classed by the government as vulnerable turned up at schools in England last Friday  which constitutes 5% of the total entitled to attend school during the lockdown  including over the Easter break. The figures from the Department for Education (DfE) confirm on-the-ground reports from schools that few vulnerable pupils are turning up. The Labour MP  Tulip Siddiq  has written to the education secretary  Gavin Williamson  expressing concern about the low turnout and calling for more funding for children’s charities and better guidance for local authorities to support those most at risk. The Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson  Layla Moran  called for urgent government intervention. “This is utterly shocking and shows just how massive the problem we face is to look after vulnerable children during the pandemic ” she said. “Government has a responsibility to keep kids safe  and we just don’t know if they are.” Schools effectively closed on 20 March as part of the national effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus  but a skeleton service has remained open for children of key workers and more than 500 000 vulnerable pupils  which include those classified as “children in need” as well as 270 000 children with an education  health and care (EHC) plan for special educational needs. When the emergency schools first opened on 23 March  around 60 000 vulnerable children attended  but by Friday 3 April the number had halved to 29 000. On the same day  85 000 children of critical workers attended. By last Friday their number had dropped to 62 000  or around 2% of all children of critical workers. Teachers and social workers say many parents have chosen to keep their children at home for fear they may catch the virus. Child protection referrals have dropped by as much as 75% in some areas  with family life hidden behind closed doors during the lockdown and children invisible to the authorities. Siddiq  the shadow minister for children and early years  said: “School is often a safe haven for vulnerable children  and the main source of identification and referral for specialist support. Teaching staff are worried that they are unable to see ‘at-risk’ children as they usually would and that they are not getting help. The very low number of vulnerable children attending school so far suggests that they are right. “We know that many vulnerable children will be more at risk in this crisis with the financial and social pressures of lockdown exacerbating problems at home. We need to see more funding for children’s charities and better guidance for local authorities to support vulnerable children  as well as reducing financial pressure on their families by fixing problems like parents being unable to access free school meal vouchers.” DfE guidance states that many children with EHC plans will in fact be better off remaining at home. School staff and social workers have been working to keep in contact with vulnerable families where children are not turning up at school. Williamson said: “Our first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people  but particularly those vulnerable young people with special educational needs or a social worker. Schools are open for them and we’re working to make sure those who should attend do so. “With up to 130 000 children in school every single day  schools are helping keep the country moving. And we are asking our local authorities and schools to ensure every vulnerable child knows that their school is there to support them  that systems are in place to keep in touch with those children who are unable to attend because of health reasons.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca5774e72e5ec50d5bcf5f47969862693a815d2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7104411d40112b5dfcaad4cdc0ff9b58 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Schools%2CSpecial+educational+needs%2CEducation%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/21/older-pupils-should-be-first-when-englands-schools-reopen,education, Older pupils ‘should be first’ when England’s schools reopen, Headteachers say priority should go to students preparing to sit exams, The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said the pupils who have most to gain from getting back to school are those in years 10 and 12 who are in the middle of GCSE and A-level courses  and those in the final year of primary  preparing to move to secondary. The approach contrasts with Denmark  which became the first country in Europe to reopen its schools last week  when under-12s were the first to return. Younger children are less able to study on their own and having them back in school allows parents to return to work. Speculation surrounding when and how schools in England will safely reopen has become increasingly fraught as the lockdown has persisted  with sharp disagreement among ministers and divergent views among teaching unions. Geoff Barton  the general secretary of the ASCL  said the earliest schools might realistically reopen would be in June after half-term. “It can only happen when supported by the science  and there will need to be a lead-in time of several weeks to ensure it is carefully planned. “It is then going to be necessary to maintain social distancing in schools as much as possible. It is likely that we will need to reintroduce certain year groups in the first instance rather than fully reopening schools to all pupils. “This could be particularly beneficial for pupils in year 10 and year 12 because they are studying GCSE and A-level courses respectively  and for pupils in year 6  who are due to go to secondary school in September.” Pressure to reopen is mounting amid growing concern  particularly for disadvantaged students who will be hardest hit. The former head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw  speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One  warned that some pupils preparing for exams might have lost out so much that they would have to repeat the whole year. Other teaching unions  which are worried about schools having to reopen prematurely because of fears over the economic impact of parents having children at home  have denounced speculation about return dates and focused purely on the public health risks to pupils  school workers and the wider community. The NASUWT wrote to the education secretary  Gavin Williamson  this week setting out five conditions for reopening  including access to personal protective equipment where required  ranging from soap to gloves  aprons and in some cases face masks  as well as guarantees on adequate staffing and physical distancing advice. The NASUWT general secretary  Patrick Roach  also warned that teachers should not be expected to clean. “The NASUWT would not expect teachers to be asked to undertake cleaning tasks or to be expected to undertake them to the necessary standards to protect the health of pupils and the workforce.” The National Education Union  which is the biggest with 450 000 members  has insisted the science should decide when schools reopen. Its petition to delay reopening until safe to do so has gained more than 160 000 signatures. Paul Whiteman  the general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT  said: “Schools should only reopen when the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe to do so. Safe for pupils  safe for staff  safe for parents.” Since 23 March only vulnerable children and the children of key workers have been attending school in person  while teachers have remained working on distance learning and support for pupils at home. Attendance in the emergency school provision has been much lower than expected because parents are keeping their children at home. A Department for Education spokesperson said Williamson had not set a date for schools to reopen. “They will remain closed  except for children of critical workers and the most vulnerable children  until the scientific advice changes and we have met the five tests set out by government to beat this virus. “We will work in close consultation with the sector to consider how best to reopen schools  nurseries and colleges when the time is right so that parents  teachers and children have sufficient notice to plan and prepare.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227e808a4ac7a74902974569632da36a28b83a60/0_276_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13b187a2117b66ad8a84e2e6007642db https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Schools%2CEducation%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CTrade+unions%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/21/pupils-begin-studying-at-home-a-challenge-for-them-parents-and-teachers,education, Pupils begin studying at home – a challenge for them  parents and teachers, Schools provide online classes  but some pupils struggle to stay motivated after cancelled exams, Through videoconference classes  assigned written exercises and self-study  teachers have sought to ensure the coronavirus lockdown affects their pupils’ development as little as possible. While some children appear to have managed the transition relatively seamlessly  others are searching for motivation after exams were cancelled and it remains unclear when face-to-face classes will resume for all. “Home-schooling a child is not easy but keeping a tight schedule works wonders for us ” says Faith Mkhonto  from Southampton  whose seven-year-old son  Kayden  has been set assessments from textbooks by his primary schoolteachers. “We both signed a contract to commit him to doing his work at a certain time each day. I let him do his studies by himself and then we go through it together.” She has been furloughed from her job as a retail store manager and is devoting her time to Kayden’s schooling – paying him 50p a day if he completes all his work. “It’s now that you really appreciate the teachers ” she admits. “Its not easy  teaching. I was unable to correctly explain a complicated maths problem so we emailed his teacher for help and he called soon after  and Kayden completely understood.” Joe Parrot  13  who lives in Stockport  has also been assigned independent study from books  provided with daily online quizzes and sent informative slideshows in the absence of digital classes at his school. Unfortunately  he is in need of greater face-to-face help for the subjects he already finds difficult. “I’m very interested in history and geography so teaching myself those has been great ” he says. “But I don’t like maths and teaching myself that has been awful. I procrastinate a lot and I need encouragement in person.” Particularly with Spanish  he says  self-study has been testing. “I’m used to a teacher saying the words so I can hear the pronunciation but we just have our booklet.” For year 12 student Saarah Omer  16  in Redbridge  east London  the lack of clarity over when she and her peers will return to school has been demotivating. “I have watched Netflix when I could have been working ” she says of the Easter holidays. “All the days are blurring into one.” Her teachers have been giving live classes online for her A-level subjects – maths  history and economics – and have set even more work than usual to keep everyone busy. But she has struggled to complete much of it despite wanting to go to university after sixth-form to study economics. Secondary school English teacher Rosie Bircham  from Aberdeenshire  is also finding that inspiring her older pupils is her biggest challenge  while the younger students are more eager to learn. “Remote teaching is going great ” she says. “Google Classroom allows you to look at their work as they go  as if you are looking over their shoulder in the classroom. “I’m getting over half of every junior class regularly submitting creative writing work to me  which is better than usual. They’re really keen  I think they must be bored.” However  many of her 15- and 16-year-old students’ interest in school has evaporated after exams were cancelled for the first time in Scottish history. “Everyone was both weirdly elated and horribly disappointed and I think they’ve carried on that mood ” she says. “They’re asking me  ‘Why have you set us work  what’s the point?’. Even those who are doing English next year for A-level just don’t seem to care.” But Bircham is mindful that there are multiple barriers preventing some children from effectively studying at home  from food insecurity to a lack of equipment. “We’ve had emails from kids who only have one laptop in their house and need to share it with their siblings and parents ” she adds. While her school is providing online classes  just like Omer’s  parents elsewhere are incredulous that they have not yet commenced more than a month after the education secretary  Gavin Williamson  announced that all schools would close to the majority of students. “It’s extremely challenging trying to keep a teenager motivated with schoolwork whilst simultaneously holding down a demanding full-time job ” says Jo Jarvis  an account manager from Leeds whose 13-year-old son  Evan  has been assigned lots of English work but little maths. “So far his assignments have been a mishmash of tasks  quizzes and articles across multiple sites with very little structure  and with some inconsistency across subjects.” After a chaotic start to home-schooling in places  schools are becoming more organised and have introduced new timetables. But challenges remain. “We simply were not able to facilitate home-learning in the time we had ” says Rob Ward  a secondary schoolteacher from Yorkshire. “Then  there were a series of botched app launches at our school prior to the holidays.” However  he is anxious not to criticise his school at a difficult time  made worse by the haste of the decision by the government which on Sunday supported the launch of the Oak National Academy  which offers some video lessons and learning resources to help mitigate vast differences in the offerings for pupils. But ultimately the role of mothers  fathers and carers is key  Ward adds: “Sadly  whilst some parents will push their kids to learn  others won’t have the time  skills or the inclination to do so.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fc2fe0498e9b06dc038fbc07216b8ebfc74ab8/0_102_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=737f3be0b36114d2133fc3e0501c6232 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3042197d02a04d1769b3d48418f3b8e2b8bb347/0_240_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=137fabac08aa89bde82e99b945474be3 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b07056c181c9c9210a1208d48bd02b2223152625/0_134_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=899564fdc43a898f40f52e5ceff85564 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/793bd23473c7f6b018f449ec9263ce694b398c23/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=867400246f1f2cdca52143650f71d282 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936e867cef46ebb1348c9c99067bebd0563b678b/0_0_1600_1200/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=511a9fcd03ff8cf84ef1b514cb107718 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Home+schooling%2CStudents%2CEducation%2CSchools%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/22/uk-ad-watchdog-bans-claims-that-iv-drips-can-treat-coronavirus,media, UK ad watchdog bans claims that IV drips can treat coronavirus, ASA cracks down on three companies marketing vitamin ‘immune boosters’, The Advertising Standards Authority banned the adverts and marketing claims made by the Private Harley Street Clinic  REVIV and Cosmetic Medical Advice UK after fast-tracking its investigations. A page on the Private Harley Street Clinic’s website promoted its Immunobooster IV infusion  which costs £350 and contains zinc and common vitamins including C  linking it to preventing infection from the virus. “Maintaining and boosting your immune system is vital as this is your protection against this virus and other pathogens ” the webpage said. In the second case  two posts on Instagram featured an image of Dr Rita Rakus of Cosmetic Medical Advice UK “having her super immune system booster drip at the clinic”. The booster  with a range of over-the-counter vitamins such as B and C in saline solution  was marketed as a “good way to boost your immune system and protect yourself from viral infections”. The third case  involving REVIV  featured a blogpost by its in-house doctor  Michael Barnish  on the company’s website. The blogpost described REVIV’s Megaboost IV Therapy as “containing a high dose of vitamin C”. Text claimed that “we are also witnessing clinical trials in hospitals treating coronavirus using high intravenous doses of the powerful antioxidant  vitamin C  with some initial positive results”. REVIV removed the blogpost after being contacted by the ASA. “As a medical professional Dr Barnish’s intention is not to mislead or state an untruth that might put someone’s health at risk ” said a spokeswoman for REVIV. “Because of his preventive health expertise he only wanted to suggest ideas that would help boost a person’s immune system during this time.” The ASA investigated after receiving complaints from the public that the ads were medicinal claims for products not licensed as a medicine by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  a breach of the UK advertising code. “The MHRA said that any mention of coronavirus/Covid-19 in the promotion of an IV drip product would bring the product under medicines regulations  as would any claim that implied treatment of  or protection from  the virus ” the ASA said. “We considered that consumers would interpret the claims to mean that an IV drip … could help to prevent people from catching coronavirus/Covid-19.” The ASA ruled that in each case the products were not licensed as a medicinal product and therefore banned the ads and marketing claims. “We concluded the ad therefore breached the UK advertising code and must not appear again in the form complained of ” the ASA ruled. Next week  the ASA’s compliance team will issue an enforcement notice  jointly with the MHRA  to other businesses that offer IV drips  making them aware of the rulings and directing them to remove any Covid-19 related claims from their websites and social media pages. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29097476863a59da32e03783a737ae6765f602fb/0_235_9096_5458/master/9096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8bc549fff4b9830289ce7950129ccc10 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Advertising+Standards+Authority%2CAdvertising%2CMedia%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CRegulators%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

She is seen learning to ride  gardening with her mother  and dancing onboard a yacht. A message accompanying the video said: “To those of you also celebrating your birthdays today at home  with or without your loved ones – we send you many happy returns.” It thanked the public for its birthday messages and wished the Queen a happy birthday. The Queen herself celebrated the day isolating behind Windsor Castle’s walls in a low-key  lockdown affair. The Covid-19 pandemic meant family members were resorting to video-conferencing to mark her anniversary as they posted birthday wishes on social media. There were no traditional gun-salutes from Hyde Park or the Tower of London  for what is believed to be the first time in her reign. They were cancelled in line with the Queen’s wishes as she believed they would be inappropriate in the current circumstances. The flying of the union flag from government buildings and town halls  as is also traditional  was taking place only where it could be implemented within government guidance on social distancing. The bells of Westminster Abbey  the scene of her marriage and her coronation  were also silent. They have pealed on her birthday since 2007  but the abbey is closed. The Queen was spending the day with the Duke of Edinburgh  who is 98  at Windsor Castle  where the couple are shielding with a reduced staff. Family members would be celebrating with her privately via video conferencing and telephoning – the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall from Birkhall  in Aberdeenshire  Scotland  and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from Anmer Hall in Norfolk. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in Los Angeles. the Princess Royal  the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex are all in their own separate homes around the country. Prince Charles shared several archive photographs of himself  and the Duchess of Cornwall  with the Queen over the years on the Clarence House social media accounts. They included one of him as a baby taken in the grounds of Windlesham Moor  country home in Surrey. Another showed Charles kissing his mother’s gloved hand as she presented him with the runner’s-up prize in the Silver Jubilee Cup match against France at Windsor Great Park in July 1988. Kensington Palace shared a picture of William and Kate with the monarch taken at the Chelsea Flower Show. In other tributes  an image of the Queen on her fourth birthday  with a Shetland pony gifted to her by her grandfather King George V  was posted by the Royal Collection Trust. She is shown as a young ATS second subaltern during the second world war in an image posted by the British Army. The Royal Airforce posted images from royal visits over the years  including one of the Red Arrows flying over the Royal Standard. Boris Johnson’s official Twitter account posted a congratulatory message “Wishing Her Majesty The Queen a very happy birthday!”. Trooping the Colour  the military ceremony held on her official birthday in June has been cancelled  with no alternative plans announced.  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fac3a9b8e49ffd5d11b97c6233c2703e8cf1e02/0_3_3240_1945/master/3240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e6cfadf6b38ae35780ddc3624c932054 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e74ddcf4d00f9f1a0c0fa62132762628daa7611d/0_29_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ef47f7b34634cc72260cc591932724b https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d767e363a5eb3a8617058dcc9853ed13ec45e3f/34_0_2452_1472/master/2452.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=424b8a42303e21ddffd5a967fc7ef401 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce65d8d277b9f53315e17b734137ea13d60b129/0_102_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5707ae7611a0e223114b58ddb3fedc6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=The+Queen%2CMonarchy%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/big-uk-airlines-and-travel-firms-denying-refunds-which-coronavirus,business, All big UK airlines and travel firms denying refunds  Which? finds, Up to £7bn owed for trips cancelled because of coronavirus - but operators fear bankruptcy if they pay out, Consumer groups have warned that the sector risks permanently losing public confidence in booking travel  with Which? finding 20 of the UK’s largest operators are illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days. Most have instead offered vouchers or credit notes  and customers have complained they have been unable to obtain refunds online or get through to make a claim on the phone. On Monday Ryanair started telling its customers that they will have to wait until “the COVID-19 emergency has passed” if they want a refund for a cancelled flight. Initially  the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking. According to the travel industry’s own estimates  up to £7bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However  industry bodies such as Iata  for airlines  and Abta  for travel firms  say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue. Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary  Grant Shapps  said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely. Which?  the consumer association  said 20 of the UK’s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips  and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed. However  it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene  recognising that firms were under “unprecedented strain” and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately. While Which? said consumers’ legal right to cash refunds should be protected  it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days  and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings  and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions  to help restore confidence. Which? researchers found 10 of the UK’s biggest holiday companies  including Love Holidays and Tui  are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days  with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier. It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time  with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints. Some carriers  such as Air France and KLM  have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed  issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was “a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face”. Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet  Ryanair and British Airways have told the Guardian they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered. A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “Airlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.” Rory Boland  of Which? Travel  said: “We do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak  but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms  especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own. “The government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans  and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.” Some governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds  after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general  Alexandre de Juniac  said earlier this month that refunding was “almost unbearable  financially speaking”  adding that airlines were “perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger … but it is a matter of survival”. Abta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers  such as airlines and hotels  and not returned. Its chief executive  Mark Tanzer  said: “The UK government  despite repeated requests  has failed to recognise and respond to this reality  in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe. “We fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling. But if companies are forced into bankruptcy  it will not only destroy livelihoods but extend the refund delays far beyond the term of refund credit notes.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b4887466fc420c2cf80539c9fdb3f05445a472/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d41bbdeb0e5190e1e1f7311283fadde https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Airline+industry%2CTravel+%26+leisure%2CConsumer+affairs%2CConsumer+rights%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CBusiness%2CTravel%2CMoney https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/latin-america-coronavirus-lockdowns-low-income,world, Lockdowns leave poor Latin Americans with impossible choice: stay home or feed families, Families struggle to maintain coronavirus restrictions as they seek to stay afloat: ‘My fear is my children going hungry’by Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro  Uki Goñi in Buenos Aires  Cindy Jiménez Becerra in La Paz  Lexi Parra in Caracas  Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá  and David Agren in Mexico City, But for Liliana Pérez  an Argentinian single mother of six  staying at home is a pipe dream. “My fear isn’t becoming infected. My fear is my children going hungry ” said Pérez  a 43-year-old volunteer from Villa Soldati  a pocket of extreme poverty in Buenos Aires  who is delivering hot meals to older people out of a baby’s pram. More than 1 500 miles away  Rio de Janeiro’s 6.7 million residents – 20% of whom live in redbrick favelas – also have instructions to hunker down. But each day Marcos de Oliveira rises before dawn in the Vila Aliança community and heads out to keep his household afloat. “It’s not just any old cold. It’s an illness we still don’t properly understand and I can see it’s getting worse in Brazil ” Oliveira  a 45-year-old metalworker  said of Covid-19  which has now claimed nearly 2 500 Brazilian lives. “But unfortunately people have to work – we’ve got to make a living.” Across Latin America and the Caribbean – where an estimated 113 million people live in low-income barrios  favelas or villas – families are struggling to adapt to coronavirus lockdowns or social isolation orders because of more immediate financial imperatives. “People are more worried about being able to feed their families than they are about the coronavirus ” said Pérez  one of more than three million people who live in Argentina’s densely populated villas. In recent days  as some governments have announced aid packages to help their poorest citizens stay home  there have been reports of containment measures fraying in places such as Venezuela’s Petare and Brazil’s Rocinha  two of Latin America’s largest communities. “There’s an avalanche of people here in the streets ” José Martins  a leader in Rocinha  told local media. “I think 60% to 70% of shops have reopened.” César Sanabria  an organizer in Buenos Aires’ Villa 31 community  said the situation there was similar and cited cramped living conditions as one explanation. “We’re trying to keep safe but it’s very difficult when a whole family lives in only 16 square metres ” said Sanabria  who runs a radio station in the 45 000-strong settlement beside Buenos Aires’ exclusive Recoleta neighbourhood. “We’re not really isolating ” he admitted. “You still see a lot of people on the streets.” Lockdown does seem to be working in some areas – albeit with dramatic consequences for already struggling residents. In Colombia’s capital  Bogotá  residents of deprived neighbourhoods have tied red rags to their windows to signal that those inside are going hungry. Riot police last week clashed with residents in Ciudad Bolívar  a sprawling mountainside neighbourhood  who were demanding food supplies promised by the president  Iván Duque. “I’ve got no money and nothing to eat ” complained María Ticona  44  a mother of five from Villa Copacabana  a deprived corner of El Alto  a high-altitude city above Bolivia’s de facto capital  La Paz. Before the lockdown – which is being strictly enforced by Bolivian troops – Ticona sold bread and scraped together perhaps $4 a day. That income has evaporated. “My kids haven’t eaten properly since the quarantine began ” she complained. Nancy Ramos  a 44-year-old resident of El Valle  a working-class community in Venezuela’s capital  Caracas  said the streets around her home were largely quiet – even if part of the credit lay with local gangsters waging a turf war in a time of coronavirus. “By 7pm  the neighborhood looks like a cemetery. There’s nobody around ” said Ramos  a car park manager who was still having to work. “I’d say the first two weeks  people were stressed out about the quarantine – nervous of getting the virus ” she added. “Now  we have a new shock: staying safe while the little gang boys run around.” Tepito – a hardscrabble barrio in central Mexico City that houses a bustling street market – is also subdued. “Eighty per cent of businesses are closed ” said Mario Puga  a local historian and activist. Residents of Rio’s 1 000-odd favelas say they are finding hibernating harder. “When I got home tonight there were loads of people in the street chatting. Kids playing hide-and-seek and football ” said Oliveira. “It’s alarming.” Social isolation also appeared to be sagging in nearby neighbourhoods  albeit for different reasons. “This morning when I was on my way to work … the bus passed a petrol station and it was packed... cars all over the place  lots of people there boozing. It was like they were throwing a rave in the petrol station ” Oliveira joked. Ivan França Jr  an epidemiologist from the University of São Paulo’s faculty of public health  said that for isolation orders to work they had to be accompanied by economic aid. “Social distancing can’t just be: ‘Don’t leave your homes ’” he said. “This is a very elitist and middle-class mindset.” Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  who was born into privation and won acclaim for his poverty relief work  said governments needed to do more to help the poor cope. “People will stay at home if they’re given the means to stay at home ” Lula told the Guardian. Regional governments say they are moving to offer such support. More than 45 million Brazilians will reportedly receive an emergency stipend of 600 reais (£91  $113) – although the president  Jair Bolsonaro  has warned such support cannot go on “eternally”. In Bolivia  where more than 80% of the labour force works in the informal sector  the interim president  Jeanine Áñez  has announced a 500 boliviano (£58  $73) benefit. “What we want is for not a single citizen to be left without help or income ” Áñez said last week. But there and across the region  some of Latin America’s neediest citizens say that is too little  too late. Before coronavirus  María Angélica García  a 40-year-old from El Alto with Parkinson’s disease  fed her five children and bought her medicines by begging at the Ceja street market with a cardboard sign. With the Bolivian bazaar now deserted and locals stranded at home she was penniless and hungry. “I hope this coronavirus situation sorts itself out ” García said. “I can’t believe what has happened.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b281086afc40c51e159964b30eabec3b1aa933/0_244_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f1cf15aa1116fd95fd9670d2f601318 https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/global-development/global-development/logo.png https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e871d104ed7511b962b72382c49fd0ab5702cef7/0_0_3992_2661/master/3992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ca4d2b0c9e4e7eef96daedb1c15e5fa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/674abc35431b19da80fd0e412c44de0de6261036/0_0_4790_2873/master/4790.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=904e526c8c82e15caa67a7f2c91bda78 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fdca24363466d99389880180e817eb5879508b/0_0_6530_4354/master/6530.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75c8fe1cdbaa11838d46c5d0c39c0297 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Inequality+and+development%2CGlobal+development%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CArgentina%2CBrazil%2CBolivia%2CColombia%2CVenezuela%2CMexico%2CWorld+news%2CAmericas https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/global-hunger-could-be-next-big-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic,world, Coronavirus crisis could double number of people suffering acute hunger - UN, Report from UN World Food Programme and others warns 265m people are facing acute risk, About 265 million people around the world are forecast to be facing acute food insecurity by the end of this year  a doubling of the 130 million estimated to suffer severe food shortages last year. “Covid-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread ” said Dr Arif Husain  chief economist at the World Food Programme. “It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock – like Covid-19 – to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.” Global hunger could become the next big impact of the pandemic  warns the Global Report on Food Crises  by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation  the World Food Programme and 14 other organisations  published on Tuesday. Some of the poorest countries may face the choice of trying to save people stricken by the virus only for them to fall prey to hunger. António Guterres  the UN secretary-general  said the report must be a call to action. “The upheaval that has been set in motion by the Covid-19 pandemic may push even more families and communities into deeper distress ” he wrote in the foreword. “At this time of immense global challenges  from conflicts to climate shocks to economic instability  we must redouble our efforts to defeat hunger and malnutrition. We have the tools and the knowhow. What we need is political will and sustained commitment by leaders and nations.” The report  which will be presented to the UN security council on Tuesday afternoon  bolsters warnings that the world could face a repeat of the 2007-08 food price rises that sparked widespread political upheaval  the impacts of which are still being felt across the Middle East and from Asia to Latin America. Food experts are worried that donor nations have barely begun to deliver the funding needed urgently on the ground to set up networks to deliver humanitarian relief to the worst-hit areas  deliveries which need to be achieved by air as ground transport is obstructed or halted over large areas. The World Food Programme estimates that $350m (£280m) will be needed immediately  but only about a quarter of the sum has yet been forthcoming. The pandemic was first felt in some of the world’s biggest economies  originating in China  then hitting Italy and Spain  and now the US has become the centre. There is less data available on the spread in developing countries  where widespread testing is not being done and healthcare systems are often lacking. The report finds that already stretched health services in developing countries are likely to be overwhelmed  while a global recession will disrupt food supply chains. There are particular concerns for people working in the informal economy  and the world’s 79 million refugees and displaced people. Labour shortages as people fall ill may put further strain on food production  protectionist measures may increase food prices  and rising unemployment will reduce people’s purchasing power  driving more into hunger. On the plus side  harvest prospects for staple crops are good  but the movement restrictions to contain the spread of the virus will create problems for food distribution. Poorer countries are bracing for the full impact of Covid-19 on their health systems  and are already seeing the effects of the economic shutdown that has sent the world spiralling into recession. Some of the poorest nations “may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods or  in a worst-case scenario  saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger”  the report warned. Even without the impact of coronavirus  the outlook for many countries – such as Yemen  where conflict has led to millions facing starvation  and in east Africa  where locusts are posing a famine threat – was already dire. Despite good recent harvests in many parts of the world  the extra stress of the pandemic will take many other nations riven by conflict or political unrest beyond breaking point. Extreme weather driven by climate breakdown is also likely to add to the toll  as it did last year. Last year  of the 130 million people suffering acute food insecurity  the majority (77 million) were in countries afflicted by conflict  34 million were hit by the climate crisis  and 24 million were in areas where there was an economic crisis. Charities and civil society groups are also calling on rich countries’ governments to take action to help the poorest at risk of starvation. Catholic Relief Services in the US is campaigning for the US Congress to devote new funds to the fight urgently. “The pandemic is a crisis on top of a crisis in parts of Africa  Latin America and Asia ” said Sean Callahan  chief executive of the charity. “The severe health risks are only part of the outbreak. Lockdowns are hampering people from planting and harvesting crops  working as day labourers and selling products  among other problems. That means less income for desperately hungry people to buy food and less food available  at higher prices.” Multinational food companies also recently warned that the number of people in chronic hunger could double to more than 1.6 billion as a result of the pandemic  and urged world leaders to take action. Nobel prize-winning economists have warned that developed nations will increase the threat of damaging recurrences of the virus in their own countries if they fail to fund measures in the poor world. However  there are signs that international cooperation on the pandemic is under strain. The US refused to sign up to an extensive draft communique by G20 health ministers that bolstered the role of the World Health Organization  preferring a brief version that acknowledged gaps in the world’s preparedness  and president Donald Trump has halted US funding for the WHO. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e3c1ed8c122429b7ef73299a7ec02d747b2679/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a10c6654c1d5989189854adbbbccf426 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e63d87c375cebb16abb4ff845f9f85a54a7108/0_530_6236_3741/master/6236.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=913c302c42e4cf6603f9114ac8edfb18 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6027ca156c1ae7fe30c2bbba4d9daf88ed1e7d4d/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd38551abd6267a2d81312859dd60c46 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHumanitarian+response%2CGlobal+development%2CEnvironment%2CUnited+Nations%2CFood+security%2CWorld+news%2CHunger https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/singapore-coronavirus-outbreak-surges-with-3000-new-cases-in-three-days,world, Singapore extends lockdown as Covid cases surge past 9 000, Fast-growing second peak of infections underlines how easily virus is able to return, While Singapore had drawn worldwide attention for what was seen as its success in containing the early stages of the outbreak  a new and quickly expanding second peak of infections has underlined how easily the virus is able to return. The tiny city-state has the highest number of cases in south-east Asia  a huge increase from 200 infections on 15 March  when its outbreak appeared to be nearly under control. About 3 000 cases have been reported in the past three days. As countries around the world have begun deliberations about loosening their own restrictions  health authorities in the city reported 1 111 new cases on Tuesday  taking the total to 9 125  with the vast majority of new infections in foreign worker dormitories  which have become the centre of the city’s outbreak. The latest tally of infections follows Monday’s count of more than 1 400 new cases. The prime minister  Lee Hsien Loong  said restrictions – which include closures of businesses and schools  and asking people to stay home – would be extended to 1 June. They were imposed at the start of April and had originally been due to end on 4 May. “Many will be disappointed by the extension ” said Lee in a televised address  acknowledging that businesses and workers were “hurting greatly”. “But I hope you understand that this short-term pain is to stamp out the virus  protect the health and safety of our loved ones  and allow us to revive our economy.” Authorities also said that restrictions would be tightened  with the number of people still working in services deemed essential to be reduced  and people asked to exercise outside alone. The first infection among Singapore’s migrant workers occurred in February  when a 39-year-old Bangladeshi national  known as “Patient 42”  developed symptoms of the coronavirus. While 19 other people who had come in contact with him were traced and tested  it appears Singapore was slow to test for the disease in the crowded dormitories leading to a cluster emerging in the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site  where they were working to expand aerospace manufacturer Bombardier Aviation’s facilities. Estimates suggests that up to a third of infections in Singapore are Bangladeshi workers. “I am afraid 1 200 to 1 300 Bangladeshis have been infected so far ” Mustafizur Rahman  Bangladesh high commissioner to Singapore  told the Dhaka Tribune last week. In a bid to reduce the chances of infection  thousands of workers have been moved to alternative accommodation such as vacant apartment blocks  while several dorms have been quarantined. Despite the surge in the number of cases among migrant workers  numbers among Singaporean nationals remain under control. The death toll from the virus stands at 11. Low-wage migrant workers  a vital part of Singapore’s workforce  account for at least 60% of its infections. More than 200 000 workers from Bangladesh  India and other poorer Asian countries live in tightly packed dormitories. Clusters of infections have expanded rapidly in the dorms after they were overlooked in the government’s earlier health measures. Social distancing is impossible in the dormitories  which house up to 20 men per room with a shared kitchen  toilets and other facilities. Most work in construction  shipping and maintenance jobs. More than half of the 43 registered dormitories have reported active viral clusters. At least 18 of the dormitories were declared isolation areas where workers have been quarantined. Several thousand other workers have been moved to other locations to reduce crowding. The government expects the number of cases to rise further as testing at the dorms continues  but hopes that the country’s partial lockdown  mandatory wearing of masks and strict social distancing will help curb the spread of the virus. The country’s national development minister  Lawrence Wong  said said in a Facebook post there was evidence that transmission across multiple dormitories could have occurred at construction sites or at places where the workers congregate on their days off to shop and socialise. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ad55fe4e82ca1b2a59b77bfd1ce2679319642e/0_109_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=51e725648236a8c21b91fd7f03991831 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CSingapore%2CWorld+news%2CAsia+Pacific https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution,world, Milan announces ambitious scheme to reduce car use after lockdown, Coronavirus-hit Lombardy city will turn 35km of streets over to cyclists and pedestrians, The northern Italian city and surrounding Lombardy region are among Europe’s most polluted  and have also been especially hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. Under the nationwide lockdown  motor traffic congestion has dropped by 30-75%  and air pollution with it. City officials hope to fend off a resurgence in car use as residents return to work looking to avoid busy public transport. The city has announced that 35km (22 miles) of streets will be transformed over the summer  with a rapid  experimental citywide expansion of cycling and walking space to protect residents as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. The Strade Aperte plan  announced on Tuesday  includes low-cost temporary cycle lanes  new and widened pavements  30kph (20mph) speed limits  and pedestrian and cyclist priority streets. The locations include a low traffic neighbourhood on the site of the former Lazzaretto  a refuge for victims of plague epidemics in the 15th and 16th centuries. Marco Granelli  a deputy mayor of Milan  said: “We worked for years to reduce car use. If everybody drives a car  there is no space for people  there is no space to move  there is no space for commercial activities outside the shops. “Of course  we want to reopen the economy  but we think we should do it on a different basis from before. “We think we have to reimagine Milan in the new situation. We have to get ready; that’s why it’s so important to defend even a part of the economy  to support bars  artisans and restaurants. When it is over  the cities that still have this kind of economy will have an advantage  and Milan wants to be in that category.” Milan is a small  dense city  15km from end to end with 1.4 million inhabitants  55% of whom use public transport to get to work. The average commute is less than 4km  making a switch from cars to active modes of travel potentially possible for many residents. Work could start on an 8km stretch of Corso Buenos Aires  one of the city’s most important shopping streets  by the beginning of May – with a new cycle lane and expanded pavements. The remainder of the work will be completed by the end of the summer  officials say. Janette Sadik-Khan  a former transportation commissioner for New York City  is working with cities including Bogota and Milan on their transport recovery programmes. She says Milan  which is a month ahead of other world cities in the trajectory of the pandemic  could provide a roadmap for others. “A lot of cities and even countries have been defined by how they’ve responded to historical forces  whether it’s political  social  or physical reconstruction ” she says. “The Milan plan is so important is because it lays out a good playbook for how you can reset your cities now. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take a fresh look at your streets and make sure that they are set to achieve the outcomes that we want to achieve: not just moving cars as fast as possible from point A to point B  but making it possible for everyone to get around safely. “I know we’ll be looking to Milan for guidance from New York City.” Pierfrancesco Maran  another of Milan’s deputy mayors  said: “We should accept that for months or maybe a year  there will be a new normality  and we have to create good conditions to live this new normality for everyone. “I think in the next month in Milan  in Italy  in Europe  we will decide part of our future for the next decade. Before  we were planning for 2030; now the new phase  we are calling it 2020. Instead of thinking about the future  we have to think about the present.” In the UK on Monday  Brighton started opening part of the seafront  Madeira Drive  only to pedestrians and cyclists from 8am-8pm. In Barnes  London  businesses and residents have coned off part of the road outside shopping parades to expand pedestrian space and help shoppers keep their distance from each other. Meanwhile in the Republic of Ireland  Dublin is suspending loading bays and parking spaces to increase space for social distancing  by using removable plastic separators. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2008b897d10f839eab386f7c72096037daf0274a/0_64_4645_2787/master/4645.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d50b27a830def6b6724d3f7d3681f32c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/246e532f29347f276325367e76cd9926d30a5ceb/0_292_2560_1012/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ef9c3c356d66807bedcce82af7aabf5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dc53522617a56eb7ccc7bc16d144e3d63b9f0c9/0_24_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57cd83a6ecd5ad3cf8886702338f0916 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33073d17a9058fe484d24dbd9e32e1ae62c8239/0_105_5504_5504/master/5504.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56ee1aa38603ae0b37233e72498a206f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Italy%2CAir+pollution%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CCycling%2CCities%2CCity+transport%2CEnvironment%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/lockdown-eased-netherlands-and-france-plan-to-re-open-primary-schools,world, Lockdown eased: Netherlands and France plan to re-open primary schools, Youngest pupils to start classes again in May as scientists say move should not cause more hospital admissions, French children would return to school in staggered year groups  the education minister  Jean-Michel Blanquer said  with no more than 15 pupils allowed in each class. Primary pupils aged from five to 11 would be the first to go back on 12 May  one day after the end of a strict nationwide lockdown. The following week older children in selected years at secondary schools and lycée would return. All classes would be back by 25 May. Blanquer said the aim was to have primary school children back in “small groups”  probably of “less than 10 pupils”. The plan is likely to prove challenging for headteachers in public schools  where classes of 30-plus pupils are common. Mark Rutte  the Dutch prime minister  announced that primary schools would reopen in the Netherlands on 11 May. The country’s infectious disease control institute found that the risk of infection from opening schools was “manageable”. Leaked scientific advice  obtained by the Guardian  says the effective reproduction rate of the epidemic has been less than one in the Netherlands since 15 March. This means that one person with the disease infects fewer than one other person in the community. Of all reported Covid-19 patients  the scientists advise  “barely 1% are under 20 years of age  while this age group accounts for approximately 22% of the entire population”. The scientists conclude: “By opening childcare  primary schools and special education  more transmission is expected among children and their parents. However  it is expected that this will not result in much additional care and hospital admissions.” “To start  children in primary schools will attend school half of the time. For example  one day one half of the pupils  the other day the other half. The starting date for all schools and day cares is 11 May ” Rutte said. Advisers will take into account data from Scandinavian countries  including Denmark  which last week reopened primary schools  and Norway  which did so on Monday. Secondary schools in the Netherlands could resume a month later if no outbreaks occurred in the intervening period in primary schools  they said. They also suggested that children up to the age of 12 could exercise without social distancing  but that the rules should be enforced for older pupils. Dutch-style phased reopening offers a model for other European countries which have so far not significantly eased lockdown measures or allowed pupils back to school. They include Italy  Spain and the UK  all of which have had high rates of infection and transmission. On Tuesday  the Spanish government announced that children under 14 would be allowed out of their homes from 27 April if accompanied by a parent. They are not permitted to exercise or play in parks  which remain shut  but they can visit the supermarket  chemist or bank. The trend across Europe is of a cautious return to pre-virus life. Austria said on Tuesday it would allow restaurants and cafes to reopen and religious services to resume from 15 May. Small shops are already open  with Germany following suit on Monday  as bookshops  florists and fashion stores welcomed customers again. Meanwhile  several countries which previously had managed to suppress the virus reported a sudden resurgence. Turkey’s outbreak hit 90 981 cases on Tuesday  overtaking China to become the seventh most affected country in the world. While Ankara took early steps to limit international travel and closed schools and restaurants soon after its first case was confirmed  on 11 March  Recep Tayyip Erdo?an  Turkey’s president  resisted calls for a total lockdown. He insisted that the wheels of the economy “must keep turning”. Reported fatalities for Turkey  at 2 140  remain much lower than is the case for other badly affected countries. However  analysis by the New York Times of death records in Istanbul showed that the city had had a jump of 2 100 more deaths than expected in a recent four-week period  suggesting the spread of the coronavirus could be much worse than officials say. In Singapore  the prime minister  Lee Hsien Loong  extended a lockdown by four weeks  until 1 June  after the city-state recorded a sharp rise in cases. Singapore instituted a successful contact tracing system for its general population. However  the virus has re-emerged in crowded hostels used by foreign workers. The measures  which include the closures of most workplaces and schools  were initially set to run from 7 April until 4 May. Loong conceded that cases had risen “in our migrant worker dormitories”. They were detected through “aggressive testing”  he said.

21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/dutch-court-approves-euthanasia-in-cases-of-advanced-dementia,world, Dutch court approves euthanasia in cases of advanced dementia, Ruling means doctors cannot be prosecuted even if patient no longer says they want to die, The supreme court’s decision followed a landmark case last year in which a doctor was acquitted of wrongdoing for euthanising a woman in 2016 with severe Alzheimer’s who had requested the procedure before her condition deteriorated. The case caused controversy in the Netherlands because the unnamed woman had to be restrained by her family as she was euthanised  having been given a sedative in her coffee beforehand. Prosecutors accused the doctor of going through with the euthanasia without properly consulting her client  saying the 74-year-old woman might have changed her mind about dying. Lower Dutch courts acquitted the doctor of wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the charges. The case was referred to the supreme court for a legal clarification “in the interest of the law”. The Hague-based court ruled: “A physician may carry out a written request beforehand for euthanasia in people with advanced dementia.” But it would have to be under the strict rules for euthanasia  including that the patient must have “unbearable and endless suffering” and that at least two doctors must have agreed to carry out the procedure. The patient must also have requested euthanasia before they could “no longer express their will as a result of advanced dementia”. Tuesday’s verdict underscored similar judgments in the lower courts  which also agreed that the 64-year-old doctor followed the correct procedures prescribed by the government. The case was seen as an important test of the law in the Netherlands  which legalised euthanasia in 2002  followed shortly afterwards by neighbouring Belgium. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65fddae6f2db13f0706b98a7a33ca69ee53cd836/0_107_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60ca08d67f1711bd672d4dcc552f684c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Netherlands%2CAssisted+dying%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CDementia%2CAlzheimer%27s%2CMental+health%2CLaw https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

The article alleged that the government’s measures to isolate those suspected to be infected were so severe that some were hiding from the police. The article prompted an angry response from Kadyrov  who said in a since-deleted Instagram video: “If you want us to commit a crime and become criminals  then just say so. Someone will take on this burden  responsibility  and will be punished according to the law  serve time in prison and be released. Don’t try to turn us into bandits  murderers.” In the open letter published on Tuesday  a collection of prominent writers  actors and musicians  along with the heads of the country’s top human rights agencies  called for a criminal case to be opened against Kadyrov and for Milashina to be put under state protection. Reported signatories included the popular novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya  the writer Dmitry Bykov  the actor Liya Akhedzhakova and the heads of Memorial and other human rights groups in Russia. A Kremlin spokesperson described Kadyrov’s video as “emotional” but added: “It’s an emotional situation right now. We didn’t see anything unusual there.” Novaya Gazeta was forced to take Milashina’s article down from its website after the general prosecutor’s office said it contained false and socially significant information “that creates a danger to the lives and health of citizens”. Tanya Lokshina  the associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch  said in a statement: “The Kremlin’s dismissive reaction to this serious threat against Novaya Gazeta is simply unacceptable and dangerous … Kadyrov asked for a signal and this is like a stark green light to Chechen officials to act on their threats.” Vladimir Putin installed Kadyrov as Chechnya’s leader in 2007 to serve as a strongman capable of preventing a return to war at all costs. In return  Kadyrov has been allowed to dominate power in the region  building up a personal guard of security forces known as Kadyrovtsy and winning elections in 2016 with nearly 98% of the vote. His father  the former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov  was assassinated in 2004. Under the younger Kadyrov’s leadership  the capital city  Grozny  has been rebuilt with several towering skyscrapers  but there has been a chilling crackdown on public freedoms  with opponents of the government hounded both at home and abroad. In its country report for Russia  Reporters without Borders describes Chechnya as a “black [hole] from which little news and information emerges”.? , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d37b962013eef0b23b49bcc3e8d32909d569663/0_0_3375_2024/master/3375.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a853b878baa349cb2a202d30c553bd0 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Chechnya%2CRamzan+Kadyrov%2CRussia%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CPress+freedom%2CMedia https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/us-urges-china-to-let-human-rights-lawyer-return-home-after-unjust-detention,world, US urges China to let lawyer return home after 'unjust detention', Wang Quanzhang has been barred from reuniting with his family after serving nearly five years in prison for ‘subversion’, Wang Quanzhang was released two weeks ago after serving four-and-a-half years for “subversion”  but told Hong Kong’s Cable TV on Monday that the authorities were still stopping him from returning home and being reunited with his family. On his release  Wang was sent for two weeks of compulsory coronavirus quarantine to his home town of Jinan  instead of to Beijing  where he lives with his wife and seven-year-old son. At the end of the 14 days his wife  Li Wenzu  said Wang was still being barred from returning to Beijing  and was under strict supervision. “I am most desperate to be reunited with my wife and son. Now Jinan [police] seem to want to restrict me from returning to Beijing ” said Wang  who added that there is no legal basis for holding him in his home town but he was “trying his best” to persuade the authorities to allow him home. The US state department said: “We remain very concerned about reports of his declining physical and mental health  and of his mistreatment in prison. “Wang was detained as part of the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] nationwide roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates beginning 9 July 2015. “We continue to call for the release of all of those unjustly detained  such as Li Yuhan and Yu Wensheng  as well as other Chinese citizens who are in detention simply for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms in pursuit of a more equitable and just society  governed by the rule of law.” In his interview on Monday – the first time Wang has been heard publicly for five years – he confirmed speculation he had been detained the longest of all those caught up in the 2015 crackdown because he refused to confess. “I never confessed  I would not compromise my principles ” he said  adding that the authorities kept putting pressure on him between 2016 and 2018 to confess. “I have no regrets ” he said. “I don’t think I have anything to boast about. I’m not some sort of hero … I do what I am meant do as a lawyer.” When the Guardian attempted to contact him  a male voice answered the call  saying he was not Wang. It appeared that Wang was back under police supervision. His wife told the Guardian she could not go to Jinan because the authorities would likely put the whole family under strict surveillance for up to two years  as has happened to many human rights lawyers after their release from prison. “We have been apart for five years and I’ve been anxious for five years. He needs a free environment and to be reunited with our son  to make up for all these years when he wasn’t around ” she said. The US statement also expressed continued concern over China’s “weak rule of law”  arbitrary detention and torture of detainees  and human rights violations. The practice of releasing activists from prison into de facto house arrest or to their home town has been labelled “non-release release” by rights groups. Human Rights Watch’s China researcher  Yaqiu Wang  said the Chinese government seemed determined to silence Wang indefinitely  and called his continued detention “a complete travesty of justice”. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6843e4d4370df09894aeb6ff14b8e91863fce105/0_160_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d0514420ffdf75003c2c00a53ceb5444 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a756fd2749c35f0ca479180a62c4dbf7d97a2ce1/0_427_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dcb14cc31856399dfbba27197453abcb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45ac70421da75b9ae3f5110aee20f9eacecf37e/0_25_747_448/master/747.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7e0921929d9d9fc3b9103562d35c301 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc741c3966ca97291dede5c9ee1a251e1b81a949/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a6ac91406b8ddeae596634bef2d81cb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b1c6dcfc45205e84e865d1f7ba0f198361703c/0_175_3929_2357/master/3929.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=115c8d58b8172460a2b29f4c33db64ad https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=China%2CHuman+rights%2CAsia+Pacific%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/ice-free-arctic-summers-now-very-likely-even-with-climate-action,world, Ice-free Arctic summers now very likely even with climate action, Scientists surprised by latest results but say carbon cuts remain vital to prevent ice loss becoming permanent, The result has alarmed scientists but they said slashing greenhouse gases remained vital as this would determine whether Arctic summer ice vanished permanently or could recover over time. If emissions remain very high  there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark  cold winter months  a possibility described as “catastrophic”. The last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September  when it reaches its annual minimum  would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice. Since satellite records began in 1979  summer Arctic ice has lost 40% of its area and up to 70% of its volume  making it one of the clearest signs of human-caused global heating. In 2019  it shrank to its second lowest extent on record. The loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean  which absorbs more of the sun’s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being increasingly linked to more extreme weather including severe winters  deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US. “Alarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050  almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change ” said Ed Blockley  who leads the UK Met Office’s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. “The signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.” Prof Dirk Notz  at the University of Hamburg  Germany  coordinated the analysis and said: “If we keep global warming below 2C  Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.” “This is the state-of-the-art in terms of sea ice simulations ” said Till Wagner  of the University of North Carolina Wilmington  US  and not involved in the new study. The new research  published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters  uses the latest generation of climate models from 21 research institutes from around the world. In climate studies  the Arctic Ocean is said to be ice-free when it shrinks to fragments with a combined area below 1m sq km  which is 75% lower than in 2019. The models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. “There is still a lot of uncertainty ” Blockley said. “But all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point  it will be gone  but when that happens is still uncertain.” Sea ice also varies naturally from year to year  making it hard to predict the date of the first ice-free summer. “There are some models [in which the summer Arctic] goes ice-free in the next few years ” said Blockley. But he cautioned that these are considered outliers and that climate scientists use the combined set of models to calculate the likelihood of events. Another surprising finding from the study is that an ice-free Arctic in the winter months appears possible if CO2 continues to be emitted at high levels. “That’s not something we’ve seen before in these projections ” Blockley said. “A winter ice-free event would be catastrophic  for some wildlife species [like polar bears] for example  that live and hunt around the sea ice.” Wagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences  from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: “It also opens up a new ocean for human exploration  from oil and gas extraction  to increased shipping  to increased tourism  each with their own perils and benefits.” Prof James Screen  at the University of Exeter  UK  said: “It is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050  the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year  but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.” Blockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic  adding: “We are showing there is still hope.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebdcc1051d8a451771c2fafffbd2e316546cfe2a/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0073bb41cb1ad4d4c412d59c7371c377 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Arctic%2CClimate+change%2CEnvironment%2CGreenhouse+gas+emissions%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
22/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/a-tiny-scientific-marvel-olaf-the-ivf-toad-brings-hope-to-at-risk-species-aoe,environment, A tiny scientific marvel: Olaf the IVF toad brings hope to at-risk species, Amphibians are at the forefront of a battle against extinction – but they’re not the only ones benefiting from ‘frozen zoos’, In some ways  this toad shouldn’t exist at all. He is the progeny of an egg from a captive mother and sperm from a wild father – a hybrid from parents who were both dead. Olaf is not the first amphibian to be born via IVF – that has been happening for years – but he is the first to be born from sperm that was frozen and thawed. “We were able to recover a genetic lineage that had disappeared  so we were able to produce an offspring from dead parents ” says Andy Kouba  an ecologist at Mississippi State University  who assisted with the project. “So that was an exciting first  to reintroduce genetic lines back into the population.” Scientists have a lot of tools to conserve species  says Kouba  but they still need to hedge against extinction in the wild. One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring. Amphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction  losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. The IUCN estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss  climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise. But amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation  hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation – for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world  frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept  in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future. How did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico  researchers captured six male toads  injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans  but the researchers also barked at them  Kouba explains  as toads urinate when frightened  and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild. The team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to Fort Worth zoo  where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish  eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs. The idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s  when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material  no technology existed to make use of it  but he believed it was important to carry on anyway. Now  biobanks for animal species – from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs – are popping up around the globe. The Frozen Zoo repository at San Diego zoo holds more than 10 000 cell cultures from nearly 1 000 different species. They are mostly from mammals  but also from birds  reptiles and amphibians. Scientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs since the 1870s. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles  and with some species  it’s incredibly low. Even within species  some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians  Kouba says  their sperm is pretty simple to freeze – but eggs are not  because they are so much larger than the sperm. “Inside that cell  you have water content  and when you start to freeze anything with water  they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.” Because fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially  they have been studied much more than amphibians  and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. “There is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species ” Kouba says. One reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species  but that it is really better to take action before a species’ numbers have crashed. “We can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction  which may allow a species to return to a healthy population ” he says. That’s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate  so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. “You release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop  and those animals will reproduce ” says Kouba. In Colorado  Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices  bison breed well but what they can’t do is move around the globe – so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF. Using assisted reproductive technologies  she has helped produce healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd. There is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. “Bio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea  like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.” She says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don’t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. “You can’t experiment on endangered species ” says Barfield. In some species  assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world  both female  both past reproductive age. Last year  researchers were able to harvest eggs from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen  with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa – a plan that could take decades to come to fruition. Back at Fort Worth zoo  Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild  Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks  coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo  the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room  193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America  all in need of a population boost. Barber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. “That was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we’re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.” But those arks are full  and more species need assistance – there’s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. “We’re not arks  we’re life rafts ” Barber says. “And we have very limited seating.” As she speaks about her passion for overlooked species  Barber’s eyes fill with emotion. “Especially with the stuff that I work with – the creepy crawlies – most people wonder: why should we care? And it’s like  well  we should care about everything because we’re all connected. Sometimes it’s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.” So far  IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species – but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. “I think it’s going to become mainstream ” he says  adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. “We left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material  bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population  so we don’t need to remove animals from the wild any more. “That will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.” This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on climate solutions  to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/physical-distancing-will-end-era-of-cheap-air-travel-industry-warns,business, Physical distancing will end era of cheap air travel  industry warns, Iata says airlines will have to raise prices 50% or go bust if Covid-19 rules are enforced, Alexandre de Juniac  the director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata)  said that if governments ordered airlines to adopt physical distancing onboard aircraft  at least a third of seats would remain empty and airlines would have to raise their ticket prices by at least 50% or go bust. “Either you fly at the same price  selling the ticket at the same average price as before  and you lose enormous amounts of money so it’s impossible to fly for any airline  particularly low cost; or you increase ticket prices by at least 50% and you are able to fly with a minimum profit. So it means that if social distancing is imposed  cheap travel is over.” Iata said domestic air traffic had slumped 70% since early January because of the pandemic and warned that any global recovery was likely to be slow. While domestic routes will open sooner than long-haul  weak consumer confidence amid recession fears will undermine a quick recovery  said Brian Pearce  Iata’s chief economist. Vietnam plans to restart all domestic flights from Thursday. Pearce pointed to China  where air travel bounced back initially when domestic flights resumed in mid-February  but said the recovery had since stalled with the number of domestic flights at just over 40% of pre-pandemic levels. In Australia  domestic flights are 10% of pre-crisis levels even though new Covid-19 infections are close to zero. Iata is conducting regional summits with governments this week and called for confidence-boosting measures. While several European countries are starting to ease national lockdowns  “an immediate rebound from the catastrophic fall in passenger demand appears unlikely”  said de Juniac. The aviation body expects 2020 global passenger revenues to more than halve from last year  a loss of $314bn (£255bn).  , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1365c44fb092c9e591190fa146faf2c160b67490/0_0_4325_2595/master/4325.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=afb3c67ed60d736f3476485376630bef https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9caa91447030be21cfdc7a7b0a0e37be26e03c39/0_112_3346_2008/master/3346.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f25fdc8f906ac8f6212da9187ff7ea0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a44bd44b06d962856371940bdeb9d43cf8fb560/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1e99808a2570f44487b1369b05446c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/788e9cccf02caf10dc13dd1bc665ab9eae28a20b/33_241_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0693ae337f9260e8b2cfd5363d40323f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4633eb5aff154c677c01168ec6864fa7064cf3ae/249_18_3251_1952/master/3251.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89a5fabde9269c5563db4fa3f6e39afa https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Airline+industry%2CBusiness%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CTravel+%26+leisure https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/21/uk-petrol-prices-to-stay-steady-despite-global-oil-price-slump,money, UK petrol prices to stay steady despite global oil price slump, RAC says motorists likely to miss out on cheaper fuel as filling stations try to stay afloat, The price of petrol could fall from £1.10 a litre to 98p after the collapse of global oil prices. But the RAC motoring group said it expected petrol forecourts to try to hold their prices to help them stay afloat during a slump in sales of petrol and diesel due to lockdown restrictions on travel. The global oil price has plummeted to 18-year lows  and in the US it has turned negative for the first time  as demand has been battered by restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 . Simon Williams  a spokesman for the RAC  said: “In theory petrol prices could fall below £1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected at the pumps – but at the same time people are driving very few miles so they’re selling vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment. This means many will be at pains not to trim their prices any further.” There is particular concern over the future for smaller forecourts which serve areas where there are few supermarket filling stations. “It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut up shop for good ” Williams said. The steady petrol prices have ignited anger at FairFuelUK  which has claimed that the price of petrol and diesel were too high before the impact of the coronavirus crisis  and has called for an independent pricing watchdog to oversee pump prices. The lobby group claims that forecourts are making profits of 20.5p a litre of petrol and 18.9p on diesel after a steady fall in global market prices since January this year. Those profit levels are well above the 13.6p and 14.6p for petrol and diesel respectively at the start of the year  according to the group’s analysis. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7de4639ec34913ff162a1877496bae665c4ac637/0_144_5144_3087/master/5144.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07577e21f2bb79493b7638d443df0695 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e1e8c4596550d4cf666a6006c457109662514d1/0_0_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d12ee1ed40a02ecd62dcc6c569429c7 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b31d9cc34add6d377d0da7284ae4f284d443a2/0_215_4204_2524/master/4204.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2cc9e6cfea61419f5a5c5485e2d62e62 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c8da20d84f52b1b7ce8d846cfee8e1e23d4a10/0_96_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d152d7936ed3cfbf6e9522f1bf32a98 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd1128471a07b5778e92315a5133c7675fdc8b26/0_257_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a38824d655dbc4634e82c635a52ed2a5 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Petrol+prices%2CMotoring%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2COil%2CCommodities%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2COil+and+gas+companies%2CMoney https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/uk-furlough-scheme-unemployment-rise-coronavirus,business, UK furlough scheme could just delay massive unemployment rise, According to one analysis  5 million more Britons could be jobless by the end of May due to coronavirus, The contrast between the US and the UK is stark. On the other side of the Atlantic economists can already have a reasonably good shot at estimating the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment because there are weekly updates on the number of people filing jobless claims. In the past four weeks  these have totalled 22 million. In Britain  the statistics are not nearly so timely. The April overview from the Office for National Statistics covers the three-month period from December to February  a now bygone age of general elections  Brexit deadlines and floods. In response to the crisis  the ONS has launched an online survey designed to come up with real-time data. But this doesn’t tell us much either. The US jobless claims are a genuine flash estimate: they provide information about what was happening last week  whereas the UK figure doesn’t even give a full picture of what was happening last month. This is a point made by two labour market experts – David Blanchflower and David Bell – in a study due to be published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research later this week. They estimate that the US unemployment rate will have risen almost five-fold in April to 20%. Given the paucity of data  all they can reliably say about the UK is that it has gone up a lot  but they have a stab at an estimate nevertheless. On the assumption that furloughed workers are in reality unemployed  Blanchflower and Bell predict unemployment in the UK will rise by 5 million to more than 6 million by the end of May. If they are right  this would give the UK a jobless rate similar to that of the US – about 20%. The government would argue that the whole idea of the furlough scheme is to ensure that the lockdown does not result in a massive increase in unemployment. But Blanchflower and Bell are right to say that furloughed workers are really an army of the hidden unemployed  and they will become a lot more visible if during the second half of this year  the government ends the wage subsidies but the economy does not snap back as quickly as ministers hope. Falling oil prices are normally good for growth because cheaper crude means business costs come down and consumers have more disposable income. This time is different  not least because you can’t take advantage of less expensive fuel if your business is shut down or your car is sitting on the drive for weeks on end. Oil prices are weak because the global economy is weak. There are specific reasons that explain why the cost of benchmark US crude has gone negative  but there has also been a 60% drop in the cost of Brent crude  which doesn’t have the same storage capacity problems. Over the next few weeks  it is not hard to envisage the cost of petrol on UK forecourts falling below £1 a litre. There will be some pick-up in the price as the lockdown restrictions are eased but without much more savage production curbs than those already envisaged the price will stay low. The reason is that life is not going to return to its pre-Covid-19 state in a hurry  if ever. People are not going to drive to do their shopping; they will have it delivered. There will be more working from home and less international travel  which is bad news for retailers without an online presence – such as Primark – and for airline companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. Nor is it great news for policymakers either  because after negative oil prices there could be negative inflation. That’s a complication they could do without. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Larry-Elliott,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7b230406d755166fb74384c5236e7c2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02793c1332a53f4c09b65f9dedbd66d3a8461c9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=592be311fb7061c01b14f42754a71fa4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea24d2acd24e900e0c3050a6edb1291635f26ee/0_237_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1d48285a607f062718516a7e6b63c8e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72394658527c342ecc4274d827f173ce5d78a230/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ef29be6cf694ba664665771345e96cb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922dc4954005532e74afed523964e86208fe8566/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2af5bca068673bd6d6d4ffa4d022a7ef https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/210e4f9d8fb703ad825ce2f4e14719221e631889/23_53_8506_5103/master/8506.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9b0dcf64039d6f8250812b09bfa9698e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+unemployment+and+employment+statistics%2CUnemployment+and+employment+statistics%2CEconomics%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/amanda-barclays-special-needs-school-closes-due-to-pandemic-frederick-barclay,world, Amanda Barclay's special needs school closes due to pandemic, Teacher contracts terminated immediately at UK school set up by Frederick Barclay’s daughter, Frederick Hugh House  in Kensington  London  was set up by Barclay a decade ago and caters for children up to the age of 16 who have special needs. School fees are £50 000 a year. Barclay  who is named as the proprietor and a trustee on the school’s website  has a teenage daughter with special needs. The Guardian has seen a letter sent by Anne Marie Carrie  the chair of the school’s board of trustees  on Monday notifying staff of the immediate termination of their contracts. “The board of trustees have been advised that due to the financial hardship incurred by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  there is no other viable option available to the charitable trust other than initiate the immediate permanent closure of the school and seek voluntary insolvency ” she said. “The board is therefore serving notice to terminate your employment with immediate effect.” Staff  who are only being paid until 20 April  had been providing digital lessons to the students since the coronavirus pandemic forced the nationwide closure of schools. “We wish to put on record our massive thanks to all of our staff  the proprietor  and our parents and children for making our school community the very special place that it has been and will always be  this is a very sad day for us all ” said Carrie. According to the school’s website  Fredrick Hugh House was founded by  and benefits from the support of  the Frederick Hugh Trust  a company and registered charity set up by Barclay. It is understood that she has injected about £3m of personal money to help support the school in recent years. Financial filings at Companies House for the Frederick Hugh Trust state that the school relies upon donations and school fees. In 2018  the most recent publicly available accounts  school fees totalled £750 000  with donations at £330 000. The school has been operating on a rent-free basis  a benefit donated by the freeholder  Frederick Hugh House Ltd  which is registered in Jersey. “It is with sincere regret that today we announce the early closure of Frederick Hugh House school ” the school said in a statement. “Due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis the school no longer has a guaranteed income and has gone into administration. We will work with administrators to ensure a financial settlement for our dedicated staff.” The school  whose pupil numbers had fallen below 10  said it had been planning to close in July. Barclay was closely involved with running the Ritz hotel – which the family of Frederick’s brother  Sir David  sold last month – until being dismissed as a director in January. She and her father have threatened legal action against his brother’s side of the family after they discovered a listening device planted by David’s son  Alistair  in the conservatory of the hotel. The Barclay brothers’ multibillion-pound business empire is controlled by David and his sons Aidan and Howard. Their assets include the home delivery firm Yodel and the online retailer Very Group (previously known as Shop Direct and before that Littlewoods)  which could also be sold. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a85cb9eab0473a88744544373fe9f77ed1a5607b/74_438_966_580/master/966.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b3d82fedd3ee79db67363706423ed189 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CSpecial+educational+needs%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2CBarclay+brothers https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/boots-and-matalan-join-list-of-firms-targeted-over-unpaid-rents-since-coronavirus-lockdown,business, Boots and Matalan among firms targeted over unpaid rents, Commercial landlords launch legal action to reclaim money withheld by businesses since coronavirus lockdown, Boots  which has continued to trade throughout the lockdown  has been criticised with other businesses  including Travelodge  for refusing to pay second quarter rent  which was due at the end of March. The high street chemist  which is part of the global chain Walgreen Boots Alliance  is classed as an essential retailer  meaning the majority of its 2 500 stores remain open. It will also benefit from the UK government’s decision to scrap business rates for retail  leisure and hospitality firms for the rest of the year. “It’s a disgrace ” said the chief executive of one of Boots’ landlords  a listed real estate investment trust. “We are trying to support the little guy  the small independent traders whose sole income is through the cash register. I said to Boots  my ability to help those people is directly related to the people who could and should pay rent  paying that rent.” Boots confirmed that the company had “paused some payments”. A spokesperson said the company had contacted some of its larger commercial landlords “to discuss options for rental and service charge payments in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our business”. The British government has allowed commercial tenants to delay rental payments for three months without fear of eviction  as part of measures to support business during the crisis. But landlords are furious that some tenants  which remain open and trading  are exploiting the situation and are increasingly turning to legal action. The fashion and homeware retailer Matalan was issued with a winding-up petition – a legal notice usually sent by a creditor to request that the courts close a company that owes it money – by a landlord when it failed to pay rent owed. The retailer  which was founded by the billionaire John Hargreaves and is still owned by the Hargreaves family  has since settled with the landlord. Secure Income REIT  a real estate investment trust that owns 123 of the Travelodge chain’s 580 hotels  said the group’s overdue rent accounted for 6% of its annual rental income. It had “reluctantly initiated actions” against the hotel chain to recoup the cash. The £1.4bn property investment group  which also owns the theme parks Alton Towers and Thorpe Park  said the hotel chain had recently reported record profits and “is owned by large  multinational investment businesses in Goldman Sachs  Avenue Capital and GoldenTree”. Another landlord  a property and investment managment company  said it was currently “investigating all legal routes” to recoup money owed by three other high street chains. Primark announced in March it would not pay £33m in rent  but said this was just the “start of a process”. Burger King  which has 500 restuarants  is also declining to pay its rent. Its chief executive  Alasdair Murdoch  told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday that he was backing a campaign  called #NationalTimeOut  for hospitality businesses to be offered a nine-month rent deferment  where landlords would extend leases and get their rents paid when businesses had recovered from the lockdown. Others backing the campaign include Wahaca  Nandos and the Gordon Ramsey restaurant group. Germany’s justice minister has warned large  financially stable companies against withholding rent  describing such behaviour as “obscene and unacceptable”. Few UK landlords expect similar government intervention. Many say they are willing to share the burden  accepting part payments and deferments  but not straight refusals to pay. “To just put two fingers up and say we aren’t paying anything isn’t fair ” said one landlord. “It’s unacceptable to watch some of these big corporates  owned by very wealthy people and private equity  not pulling their weight.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8718d4fe40f58d2ab4110a7f667aeec26ac9ebf2/0_193_5374_3222/master/5374.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46c6a77aacb156797bdc50b8d0dcb624 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031093e2ce686be86b8207810eb6a868f603d94b/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8a144b16f90eeb650c8b41d043378ea https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd502aff08e89ac1d4c195951ff68edb32acf1d/161_312_3588_2153/master/3588.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3df22a41f3462170efc2026ee3c5f661 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75c211e83da725e4f5d4b231d3ff5a00fff423b0/0_169_6280_3769/master/6280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc32f78f8f4df9d36db21b5b054c921e https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed89327fbc48731900c3a09c52a7a99a05b52cd5/405_288_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5300431d7e020a844873baa42102f274 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Commercial+property%2CAlliance+Boots%2CBusiness%2CRetail+industry%2CHotels%2CBurger+King%2CPrimark%2CReal+estate%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

John Lewis said it feared department store sales could fall by one third. It is furloughing 14 000 staff and slashing hundreds of millions of pounds from its spending plans. The employee-owned group  which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain  said it was planning for a “worst-case scenario” in which John Lewis would experience steep sales declines until June  followed by a period of weak demand. Associated British Foods (ABF)  the owner of Primark  said it had furloughed 68 000 workers around the world. It has also written off £284m of stock  including Euro 2020 merchandise and spring fashions  which it is unlikely to ever sell. The fashion chain has also rented nearly a third more warehouse space to help store £1.5bn of stock already ordered from suppliers which it cannot sell because its entire global network of 370 stores is closed during the crisis. It does not sell online. The group has cancelled its interim dividend  worth £95m last year  while executive directors will halve their pay during the crisis. The company said Primark was losing £650m in sales and paying out £100m in cash for every month its stores remained closed. George Weston  the chief executive of ABF  said he was keen to reopen Primark’s stores but urged the government not to lift restrictions too early as a second lockdown would be the “worst thing”. The company said it had the necessary finances to survive even its worst forecasts  under which stores would remain closed until next May. Weston said: “In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.” Sharon White  who was installed as the John Lewis group’s chairman in February  said it was a time of “great uncertainty and volatility” with the full-year picture for its finances “impossible to predict”. “Over the course of the full year  this worst case would result in a sales decline of around 35% in John Lewis – around double the current level – while at Waitrose it would result in a more modest decline of less than 5%.” The store group’s financial performance has been hit hard by the lockdown which forced the closure of John Lewis’s 50 stores. Online sales have soared 84% since the middle of March – as Britons established home offices  schools and gyms – but that has not offset sales lost through shop closures. Shoppers were “buying more Scrabble but fewer sofas”  White explained  which was resulting in a profit squeeze. Over the past five weeks John Lewis sales were 17% down on 2019. In common with other food retailers  Waitrose has seen a huge pick up in sales  up 8% over the last three months  as shoppers stockpiled rice  pasta and frozen foods. However  running costs have also increased as it installed safety gear in stores  such as plastic shields  and expanded its online grocery service. Last year  the group started merging the Waitrose and John Lewis management teams to cut costs  eliminating the posts of managing director for both Waitrose and the John Lewis department stores chain. The annual report  published on Tuesday  revealed that the Waitrose boss  Rob Collins  and his counterpart at John Lewis  Paula Nickolds  would collect a pay off of about £900 000 each. News of the big payouts came as the group said it was giving staff – barring senior managers – a one-off award of £200 each. The senior management team  including White  is taking a 20% cut in pay. The chancellor’s business rates holiday would save it £135m this year  the company said  while deferring its VAT bill until 2021 would also help its short-term cashflow. Although some John Lewis staff have been redeployed to Waitrose  the retailer said more than 14 000 department store staff were being transferred into the government’s emergency wage support scheme. Other cost-saving measures announced by the group included buying less stock and shaving £100m off its marketing spend. The company  which is owned by its employees  known as “partners”  is also slashing more than £200m from its spending plans. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30131b0f876693024fec5fcc9b458191e7c3459/0_116_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92c273e790bc4662e475c0b4fe9f8236 https://media.guim.co.uk/a76d34e07016d0e35abef6a39c129b1b43932e12/42_549_7886_4732/140.jpg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da6924b13762a54226fe8f90a8c8e3b85e94bf9/0_162_4858_2915/master/4858..jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48cf155ee97983d1c098cd2acbdf69d5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4319ef7a4b0718f50cb18edb105b571d84f82/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39f422c5de26d06554d18fc78800e51 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c0212224112595060ed17c4364a1de9e2abd7eb/0_222_6720_4036/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e94421c9d2a93d58bed423dc9fc22763 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d998f8ab42efd322602727e58ca6ff7ad32fb6d8/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da03dea9db86590a785c53e501bfd80c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=John+Lewis%2CBusiness%2CRetail+industry%2CWaitrose%2CUK+news%2CJob+losses%2CPrimark%2CAssociated+British+Foods%2CFood+%26+drink+industry https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/china-doles-out-shopping-vouchers-to-coax-shoppers-back-to-shops-coronavirus,business, China doles out vouchers to encourage shoppers to spend again, Reluctance to visit reopened stores may prove trial run for rest of world after pandemic, Although the country’s shopping malls and restaurants have largely reopened their former customers are proving reluctant to return as they worry about both their physical and economic health  against a backdrop of rising unemployment. The strict lockdown imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus in China resulted in a shock contraction of the world’s second-largest economy in the first quarter of 2020. Retail sales plunged by a fifth in both January and February. Now local authorities and businesses are looking for creative ways to stimulate demand. Some cities are encouraging two-and-a-half-day-long weekends to boost spending  with Communist party officials told to set an example by going shopping and eating out. Last month  Suning  a major retail group selling electronics  clothing and food  dished out 600m yuan (£70m) worth of vouchers to shoppers while Chinese web giant Tencent has launched a “buy now  pay later” credit feature on its messaging app WeChat. “China’s consumer recovery will shed some light on what may happen in the rest of the world as the outbreak eventually peaks and recedes ” said Ned Salter  head of equities research at Fidelity International in a note. “There are clear signs of recovery across segments  although the pace of normalisation is somewhat slow. We need to see more consumer confidence to sustain the improvement.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c0212224112595060ed17c4364a1de9e2abd7eb/0_222_6720_4036/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e94421c9d2a93d58bed423dc9fc22763 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da6924b13762a54226fe8f90a8c8e3b85e94bf9/0_162_4858_2915/master/4858..jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48cf155ee97983d1c098cd2acbdf69d5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4319ef7a4b0718f50cb18edb105b571d84f82/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39f422c5de26d06554d18fc78800e51 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30131b0f876693024fec5fcc9b458191e7c3459/0_116_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92c273e790bc4662e475c0b4fe9f8236 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d998f8ab42efd322602727e58ca6ff7ad32fb6d8/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da03dea9db86590a785c53e501bfd80c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Chinese+economy%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CChina%2CAsia+Pacific%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news%2CTencent%2CGlobal+economy%2CEconomics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
21/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/specieswatch-glass-eels-can-these-slippery-customers-stage-a-comeback,environment, Specieswatch: glass eels – can these slippery customers stage a comeback?, Efforts to protect the European eel  under threat from pollution and the damming of rivers  are having some success, Eels are thought to begin life as eggs in the Sargasso Sea; drifting as larvae for about a year 4 000 miles north-east in the Gulf Stream before turning into tiny transparent eels. Their goal is to find a home in rivers  lakes and ponds while growing darker and larger for up to 10 years. When nearly a metre long they set off back across the Atlantic to breed. Eels were once common but the species is now critically endangered. This is partly because many rivers have been blocked with weirs and dams and others polluted. Another only recently discovered reason is that tinned and processed foods made with eels  analysed in Hong Kong and thought to be equally scarce Asian eels  turned out to be the European variety. The glass eels had been caught illegally in Europe and shipped to Asia to be grown in eel farms. Despite these setbacks  a Europe-wide effort to protect eels and help them upstream is having some successes. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13f0a177c7ab1bd9c3d95d12422c1b7baef93e3/0_1351_3712_2226/master/3712.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d5bf62e7a481e3c967d66ab3cb5bc76 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Environment%2CPollution%2CUK+news%2CAnimals%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/advisers-warn-over-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxation-amid-cabinet-split,world, Cabinet split as experts warn: don't ease Covid lockdown too soon, Ministers weigh fears of fresh coronavirus wave against impact of shutdown on economy, With Boris Johnson still recuperating at Chequers  his senior ministers have been at loggerheads over whether the public health and economic impact of the lockdown will soon begin to rival the consequences of the virus itself. Rishi Sunak  the chancellor  Michael Gove  the Cabinet Office minister  and Liz Truss  the trade secretary  are known to be among those raising concerns about the impact of a lengthy shutdown on the economy  and on health conditions outside of coronavirus  since excess deaths from other causes appear to have risen too. But other ministers appear to have taken on board the latest evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  combined with Johnson’s own caution  and rowed back from initially hawkish positions on when schools and some businesses can return to normal. Those whose positions are thought to have softened in recent days include Gavin Williamson  the education secretary  and Alok Sharma  the business secretary. On Monday the reported death toll in UK hospitals rose by 449 – the lowest daily total for some time – and Angela McLean  the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser  said the figures were “pretty much stable and flat”  raising hopes that the UK could have passed its peak. However  one cabinet source said the government’s advisers on Sage had presented the case that not a single loosening of measures could be undertaken soon without pushing up the rate of transmission for each person infected  known as R – and not enough data existed to say when it would be safe to do so. The source said: “The scientists are very clear. There’s no loosening of measures we can do that won’t bring the R back over 1. There may be some small changes on their own that could do it  but the question is whether behaviours change in other ways and push the R above 1. The second you have the R above 1 then you’re back to exponential growth. “We did have an R of about 3. And we’ve driven that down. But even a small increase in transmission could put you above 1.” Even small changes  such as allowing more activities in parks or reopening some retailers  could increase the transmission rate too much  they said. Johnson is not working while he recovers from his stint in intensive care  but is receiving updates on the crisis and is on the side of those concerned about stopping a second peak. Matt Hancock  the health secretary  is firmly in the same camp as the prime minister  arguing that the transmission rate has to be brought down to a very low level before the lockdown can be eased. It makes Hancock the most strongly in favour of ensuring the spread of the virus is suppressed out of the key decision-making quad that also comprises Gove  Sunak and Dominic Raab. Raab  the foreign secretary  who is deputising for the prime minister  is known to be instinctively very mindful of the economic consequences of the lockdown  but also very supportive of the argument that lifting the measures too soon could lead to a disastrous second peak. Other key cabinet ministers – Sharma and Williamson – have been reportedly keen that the lockdown should be eased  but appear to have pivoted more towards caution in recent days. In an internet seminar last Friday  hosted by the CBI  Sharma echoed the prime minister’s position that lifting the lockdown too early could bring further setbacks to business because of a second peak of the illness  and said “that’s the worst possible thing you could do”. In public  both Gove and Sunak have been careful to back the No 10 position that the lockdown is necessary for some while yet. Sunak told the daily No 10 press conference on Tuesday that “we can’t have the risk of a second peak. That would not only be bad for health outcomes  it would also be bad for the economy”. However  multiple Whitehall sources confirmed that Sunak and Gove are on the hawkish side of the spectrum about lifting restrictions. One government adviser told the Guardian that new conversations are now going on about the public health risks of an extended lockdown. The source said: “There’s a general feeling that we have been completely public health-guided but lockdown is not without its public health consequences as well. The increase in domestic abuse and also the established statistics show that whenever there is a recession  people die. “There’s a discussion now saying of course we want to see that [science] but remember that if we stay locked down  this is having vital real-life consequences as well and we can lose thousands of lives through recession too.” Gove is now leading a strategic unit in the Cabinet Office about the possible routes to easing physical distancing restrictions  but nothing is likely to be decided until Johnson is back at work. One paper under discussion is about the possibility of a traffic light system  whereby some shops could open in the red phase  car journeys and wearing of face masks would happen in the amber phase  and only in the green phase could mass gatherings restart. Downing Street sources played down the significance of the traffic light paper  saying many options were being considered. Before ministers can finalise a plan for easing the lockdown  they will need to have put in place an infrastructure for stopping further spread of the virus. Jeremy Hunt  the former health secretary  warned on Monday that contact tracing “needs to be our next national mission” in addition to greater testing capacity. Hunt  who is chairman of the health select committee  said a national figure outside of politics was needed to spearhead contact tracing  adding: “I hope we will get a move on so the cabinet has a choice to the current national lockdown when they come to review this decision in three weeks’ time.” A major report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also said on Monday that testing and contact tracing in the community is the “most promising approach” in the short term to help lift the lockdown. The study said isolating people with coronavirus and tracing their contacts so they also isolate – an approach abandoned by the UK early on – is the key to controlling further outbreaks. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b50000889427197ab6d58899a30131eda1edfd3/0_133_3725_2236/master/3725.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1c15b04ed206ed80dcf709e3708e62e https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth+policy%2CUK+news%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CPolitics%2CMatt+Hancock%2CRishi+Sunak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CMichael+Gove%2CLiz+Truss https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study,environment, Air pollution may be ‘key contributor’ to Covid-19 deaths – study, Research shows almost 80% of deaths across four countries were in most polluted regions, The analysis shows that of the coronavirus deaths across 66 administrative regions in Italy  Spain  France and Germany  78% of them occurred in just five regions  and these were the most polluted. The research examined levels of nitrogen dioxide  a pollutant produced mostly by diesel vehicles  and weather conditions that can prevent dirty air from dispersing away from a city. Many studies have linked NO2 exposure to health damage  and particularly lung disease  which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19. “The results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world ” said Yaron Ogen  at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany  who conducted the research. “Poisoning our environment means poisoning our own body  and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.” The analysis is only able to show a strong correlation  not a causal link. “It is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus ” Ogen said. A separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy correlated with the highest levels of air pollution. The new research  published in the journal Science of the Total Environment  compared NO2 levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions. He found that 78% of the 4 443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO2 levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution. Ogen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains  which helps trap pollution  as is Hubei province in China  where the pandemic began. “However  my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution  air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks ” he said. Prof Jonathan Grigg  from Queen Mary University of London  said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO2 levels. “This association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection  but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example  the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.” Widespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However  long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution. In the UK  NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO2 levels is the introduction of clean air zones  where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. Jenny Bates  an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth  said: “This new study is worrying. We know NO2 is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections  so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO2 could be more susceptible to coronavirus. “This is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7e021af8639d464634f30557e38062b2cdeb9ac/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0483011671520b9530d3411c6d81846 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Air+pollution%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMedical+research%2CEnvironment%2CScience%2CWorld+news%2CGermany%2CSpain%2CFrance%2CItaly%2CEurope%2CInfectious+diseases https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/uk-care-home-bosses-call-for-help-from-medics-as-death-toll-grows,society, UK care home bosses call for help from medics as death toll grows, Five of the largest care home providers have now recorded a total of at least 1 052 deaths, Care UK  which runs 122 homes in England and Scotland  revealed a 65% increase in deaths in just four days and said the virus had reached 70% of its homes. Four Seasons Health Care  which operates 190 homes  said fatalities had increased by 60% in six days  with nearly two in three of its homes affected. Ministers have continued to cite a figure of 217 care home deaths across England and Wales  which was published last week by the Office for National Statistics with a three-week time lag. But five of the largest providers contacted by the Guardian have now recorded at least 1 052 deaths between them from confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19. By Friday  412 people had died in homes operated by HC-One  Britain’s largest care home provider  an increase of a third in four days. “Social care is clearly on the frontline  yet we haven’t drawn up a fully fledged battle plan ” said Vic Rayner  executive director of the National Care Forum  which represents charitable care home networks. The forum wants medical staff and clinical equipment urgently targeted at care homes. Rayner said homes had been forced to “second guess” how to treat the disease. “We are not focusing enough attention at a medical level on how best to keep people safe in these environments. We always knew these were the most at-risk groups  but we haven’t responded to an unprecedented situation with an unprecedented plan as we did in hospitals.” UK care homes are not typically staffed by doctors or registered nurses. Residents’ health is overseen by GPs  who have been restricting consultations to phone or video calls to avoid contagion. Doctors say this is sufficient to draw up a treatment plan in most cases  but it has left some care staff feeling isolated as the virus sweeps through homes. In the largest networks  50% to 70% of properties are affected – many times higher than the 13.5% estimated by England’s chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  last week. MHA  the largest charitable provider of care homes  has recorded at least 251 deaths  an increase of 20% in three days. Barchester reported 130 Covid-19 deaths  with a further 66 dying after hospital admission  and cases in half of its 230 homes. Bupa  one of the largest providers  with more than 120 homes  declined to reveal its death toll but said it was updating residents  relatives and the sector’s regulator. Care England  which represents some of the largest providers  estimated last week that the number of deaths across all care homes could already be as high as 7 500  while a National Care Forum survey suggested more than 4 000 had died from Covid-19 in UK residential and nursing services by 13 April. Such are the rising tolls that some bereaved relatives have complained of pressure from care home operators to arrange the rapid removal of the dead. “Where there have been several deaths  care homes are applying pressure to families to remove [bodies] quickly ” said Helen Wildbore  the director of the Relative and Residents Association. “At a time when you are grieving and emotional  it is the last thing you want to think about.” She added that many funeral directors lacked the capacity to help at short notice. Research by London School of Economics academics suggests that if the UK follows international trends  care homes could ultimately account for around half of all deaths from Covid-19. Updated figures from the Long Term Care Policy Network show that in Italy  Spain  Portugal  Ireland  France  Belgium  Norway and Canada  the proportion of all Covid-19 deaths that occurred in care homes ranged from 33% to 64%. Dr Richard Vautrey  chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee  said: “We do need to identify the patients in our care homes that would benefit from hospital admission. The worry that hospitals would be overwhelmed has not been the case in most parts of the country.” Some care homes were told by doctors early in the crisis that they should not expect to send any Covid-19 patients to hospitals  which were expected to face extreme pressures on their capacity from the wider population. Ministers have made clear that this should not happen en masse and that each case must be decided on its merits. Updated figures on deaths in care homes will not be available from the Care Quality Commission until 28 April. It started asking care homes whether people had died from Covid-19 only on 9 April  two and a half weeks after Boris Johnson announced the UK-wide lockdown. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every death from this virus is a tragedy and that is why we are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this global pandemic. “Our adult social care action plan sets out how we are protecting workers by ramping up testing across the system for care workers and their families and ensuring millions of additional PPE items reach those on the frontline. “The government has announced over £3bn to help local authorities deal with the immediate impacts of Covid-19.’’ , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563fbccdf1756de277b52d7331ca5d5fa296266a/0_93_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18391c1b88d3c751a21288fe0d940528 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Social+care%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif

On Tuesday prices rebounded above above zero  with the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May changing hands at $1.10 a barrel after closing at -$37.63 in New York on Monday. The rapid market decline of recent weeks had reached fever pitch on Monday as traders reached their last day to trade oil for delivery in May before the contracts expire. The deadline triggered a collapse in prices as desperate oil traders with more crude than storage space were forced to take action. Daniel Yergin  a Pulitzer-winning oil historian  said: “The May crude oil contract is going out not with a whimper  but a primal scream.” The price of oil from the US shale heartlands has been declining steadily in recent weeks following the biggest slump in oil demand for 25 years steps due to restrictions on travel to curb the spread of Covid-19. The fall accelerated amid rising fears that the global economy may be facing its deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Oil producers have continued to pump near-record levels of crude into the global market even as analysts warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would drive oil demand to its lowest levels since 1995. The emergence of negative oil prices is expected to prompt some oil companies to hasten the shutdown of their rigs and oil wells to avoid plunging deeper into debt or bankruptcy. The collapse will come as a blow to US President Donald Trump who took credit for brokering a historic deal between the Opec oil cartel and the world’s largest oil producing nations to limit the flood of oil production into the market. The pact to cut between 10 million and 20 million barrels of oil from the market from next month was dismissed by many within the market as “too little  too late” to avoid a market crash. At his daily White House briefing  Trump described the negative price as a “short-term problem”. He said the US was filling up its strategic reserves: “If we could buy it for nothing  we’re gonna take everything we can get ” he said. The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being stored in “supergiant” oil tankers outside the world’s largest shipping ports  including in the US Gulf. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009  when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover. Historically weak oil markets are likely to bring lower prices for drivers at service station forecourts  but the price collapse will also hurt pension savings which are often invested in major oil companies through funds which track equity markets. The oil price crisis has already wiped billions from the market value of the largest oil companies  many of which will not be able to pay dividends if the market rout drags on. Brett Fleishman  from climate campaign group at 350.org  said the collapse of oil prices is “another powerful example of how fossil fuels are too volatile to be the basis of a resilient economy”. “We are experiencing an unparalleled upending in our economies. And it is time for the fossil fuel industry to recognize that  from now on  the cheapest and best place to store oil is in the ground ” he said. “While this recession shows us that we desperately need sustainable  resilient  and stable economic systems  based on renewable  accessible and just energy sources  the fossil fuel industry is not only trying to profit off of the current chaos  but continues to drive us further into climate breakdown ” Fleishman added. Oil prices began to rise again on Tuesday as oil traders turn their attention to trading oil for delivery in June. The US oil market - known in the industry as the West Texas Intermediate price - is expected to trade above $20 a barrel this week  recovering from its slump into negative territory. The international oil price benchmark  known as Brent crude  is trading at around $26 a barrel. The recovery is expected to pick up over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted  raising demand for fuels and oil. At the same time supply is expected to dwindle due to the historic deal to limit oil production and the financial collapse of weaker oil companies. However  most analysts believe that oil prices will fail to reach the same price levels recorded at the beginning of the year before the outbreak. Brent crude reached highs of almost $69 a barrel in January before plummeting to less than $23 a barrel at the end of March. Many market experts predict the price of Brent will remain below $50 a barrel this year. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376ca2992e135e88ecfe74e02c81ef90a9288b81/0_56_1772_1064/master/1772.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cfd069c3d646dec72f6465b42c6dfa76 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca26e8eee462e4a2d61cb1bdb9afb7106c003c1/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9198bf460707d717e7fd5f284f94cb4d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69699d035f6fb46daaf815f630a23c34464494f8/0_165_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0796b0517b94673295474b285f4cc9bb https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4cd76ea2d6fd99f72679cdc0c38e8ee1c0ae00/0_69_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f0beed83c374c4f4ed5e58611756bafa https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6541568b8964866c636e3d5f8ba278b195bdd24d/84_167_5162_3097/master/5162.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bca84afab32ef385306b0c0e6c88000a https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Oil%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUS+news%2CCanada%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/richard-branson-renews-virgin-plea-for-coronavirus-support,business, Branson to mortgage Caribbean island as he seeks Virgin bailout, Fresh appeal comes after UK government rejects initial proposals for £500m loan, Branson  who is the UK’s seventh richest person with an estimated £4.7bn fortune  and has lived tax-free on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands for the last 14 years  promised in a public blogpost on Monday that he would “raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible”. Branson  69  made the pledge as he tried to convince the government to give his airline a £500m loan to help it through the “devastating impact this pandemic continues to have”. “The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it ” he said. “We will do everything we can to keep the airline going – but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.” Branson is facing mounting criticism for seeking financial assistance from the taxpayer  rather than using his own fortune to rescue the airline. Many pointed out that the entrepreneur has paid the exchequer no personal income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Guardian this month it was unacceptable that “rich billionaires [were] milking the system” at a time of national crisis. Diane Abbott  the MP for Hackney North and former shadow home secretary  said on Monday: “Branson has not paid tax in this country for 14 years. On no account should he get a taxpayer bailout  loan or otherwise.” Branson’s fresh plea for taxpayer support comes after the government rejected Virgin Atlantic’s initial proposal for a £500m aid package. The Treasury rejected the proposal  and told Virgin to explore other ways to raise cash before seeking state assistance. Branson said he was asking for a taxpayer loan  not a handout: “This would be in the form of a commercial loan – it wouldn’t be free money and the airline would pay it back.” He dismissed the idea that he should consider tapping into his vast personal wealth rather seeking government support. “I’ve seen lots of comments about my net worth – but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis  not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw ” he said. The billionaire later confirmed that he is not offering Necker Island as collateral on loans from the UK taxpayer  but only as security against commercial loans. “He and the team at Virgin Group will use the resources available to them which could even include raising money against Necker ” his spokesperson said. “He does not state that Necker Island would be used as collateral against any potential government support Virgin Atlantic may receive.” Branson has pledged to inject $250m (£197m) into Virgin Group  his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships  and which employs about 70 000 people. The pledge – of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline – is 5% of his fortune. Branson is the 268th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.9bn paper fortune  according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Branson founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984 and retains a 51% stake  alongside the US airline Delta with 49%. On Monday  Branson said he and his wife  Joan  “did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island. “Over time  we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business  which employs 175 people. As with other Virgin assets  our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group.” Branson also sought to defend Virgin’s decision to sue the NHS after his Virgin Care company lost a £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey. NHS Trusts paid out an undisclosed amount. “Virgin Care was never intending to profit from it and 100% of the money awarded went straight back into the NHS ” he said. “If Virgin Care ever does make a profit  we have committed to reinvest 100% of that back into the NHS.” Fiona Nicholls  a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK  said: “Richard Branson’s letter failed to convince us that suing the NHS wasn’t bad for the health service  moving his money to a tax haven wasn’t to avoid tax  or that emitting millions of tonnes of pollution wasn’t bad for the environment. There are still no justified grounds to give Virgin an unconditional bailout. Public money should be used for public goods.” Branson has the backing of bosses at Airbus  which makes Virgin Atlantic’s planes  and Rolls-Royce  which makes its jet engines  who have warned ministers that if the airline collapsed  it could drag them down too. The chief executive of Manchester Airports Group  Charlie Cornish  wrote to the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  calling on the government to step in and support the airline. He said Virgin flights were “directly benefiting the economies of Manchester and the surrounding region”. Virgin Australia  the country’s second-biggest airline  is on the brink of collapse after it failed in its attempt to secure a AU$1.4bn (£715m) bailout from the Australian government. The airline  which is 10% owned by Virgin Group  is expected to appoint administrators as soon as Tuesday. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052b530db28bc50c8726b20931fb18af85468eed/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a8f2ec5689e838781cf60bde6d76a98 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWCRACoWkAENqb1.jpg https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aec9b49b6f5f467607ee0b452e9ef0a4f424da5/0_108_1928_1157/master/1928.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b4f0e98633d5c4b3651ee0c96967515 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/066aacf844d7bd4c699fe0378ddca309c3379cee/0_169_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92def788753024fd34a69b8c651ae57c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Virgin+Atlantic%2CAirline+industry%2CVirgin+Group%2CRichard+Branson%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CBritish+Virgin+Islands https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nhs-frontline-meet-people-risking-lives-tackle-coronavirus,world, On the frontline: meet the NHS workers tackling coronavirus, From emergency arrivals to critical care  photojournalist Jonny Weeks was given extraordinary access to University hospital in Coventry to document the Covid-19 pandemic. This photo essay captures the contributions of those who save our lives, In preparation for his latest 12-hour shift in ITU  where the worst affected patients are given life support  Billyard begins to don several layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) over his blue scrubs. First a pair of latex gloves  then a surgical hat. Next a full-length gown tied together at the rear  followed by an additional pair of latex gloves which are meticulously taped on to the sleeves for extra security. Finally  an FFP3 mask  which grips his face so tightly it will leave red marks across his cheeks  and a yellow-rimmed plastic visor to provide a secondary barrier against the disease. “I feel trepidation ” he says softly  before entering. “There’s a load of patients in there and I don’t know if they’re going to survive this.” Billyard is one of more than 9 000 employees at the hospital  all of whom – porters and nurses  cleaners and chaplains  consultants and volunteers – have a vital role to play in the treatment of patients and the functioning of the hospital. Emily Jones  a senior sister in the emergency department (ED)  works on the hospital’s frontline. “ED is usually quite noisy ” she says. “But that’s not the case now – you don’t see the patients immediately  until you look through the curtains  and then you realise quite how unwell they can be. “We’ve had everything from patients who have self-presented at the door saying: ‘I’ve had a cough for a few days ’ to people who have walked up the stairs to get to the emergency department and can barely hold a sentence with you. We’re also getting crews bringing in patients of various ages who are struggling to get breaths while they’re on oxygen.” The West Midlands is one of the UK’s most affected regions. At the time of writing  University hospital has admitted 568 patients with Covid-19 and recorded 161 deaths from it  while 316 patients have been discharged after making full recoveries. It has transferred its minor injuries unit to a neighbouring hospital within the Trust  allowing it to prioritise the influx of Covid-19 patients. “Wow ” Jones says  pausing at the severity of the symptoms she’s treating. “The acuity of our patients has gone up so much. They are so much sicker than we previously saw.” A blizzard of healthcare staff whirls around her – some reading patient notes  others making telephone calls  washing hands  cleaning everything in sight and  heartbreakingly  placing a picture of a dove on to the door of one of the patients. “That’s to show they’re on the end-of-life care pathway ” a nurse explains. “It means we should give them peace.” Patients who present with less life-threatening difficulties are often transferred to the respiratory wards on level three for round-the-clock care. There  the eerie silence continues. With no families visiting and the corridors all but empty  it feels like a ghost hospital. University hospital currently has 91 Covid-positive patients  12 of whom are in ITU  with a further 72 designated “query Covid” who are yet to be tested. Some lie in isolation rooms  texting friends and loved ones  others in wards of six beds; many seem in a state of shock and weariness  barely registering the world around them. Mark Anders  a local paramedic  was himself struck down by Covid-19. “We all joked about going to emergency coughs and high temperatures  because that’s all we were going to.” He fell ill during a Saturday night shift. “I got halfway through the shift and I said to my crew mate: ‘I don’t know what it is; I just don’t feel right ’” he says. “Then I got home and the temperature started. I had a week at home of self-isolating  looking after myself  taking paracetamol every four hours  fluids  just trying to do everything to keep my temperature down. After a week I couldn’t control it. From there on: nightmare.” Anders was lucky. As doctors readied him for transfer to ITU  his body began to fight back. Sitting in his pyjamas and still bearing bloody scars around his septum from the oxygen supply that kept him alive  he has been told he can soon return home to his family. “Massive ” he says  when asked about the value of the NHS. “It’s the first time I’ve been this ill in my life. They have been brilliant.” The first case of Covid-19 in Coventry was on ward 50  the renal ward. Lakhbir Kaur  known to her colleagues as Lacky  has been a sister there for five years. She treated Coventry’s “patient zero” and has watched with concern as the virus has spread through the local community. She fears that it may also transition from patients to staff. For much of her shift  she wears only an apron  gloves and surgical mask – the kind you would find in a dentist’s surgery. “It’s scary ” she says. “Our masks already have an expiry date on them and the NHS have covered up the existing expiry date with a further expiry date. What is that? Are they hiding something or are they legitimately tested? “Infection control have said they have been retested [and are fit for purpose] for another 10 years. I’m wary about that. I really am. I’m a single parent – I’ve got a daughter. She’s the thing I live for. The thought of taking this home from work to her freaks me out.” University hospital follows guidance on PPE requirements from Public Health England  the government body. Fiona Wells  who works in infection prevention control  is one of those responsible for dispensing and teaching safe use of PPE. “PPE is an extremely emotive topic ” she says. “People are very frightened about the possibility that it might not be enough. “Some of the images we see [from abroad] show people dressed up in hazard suits … and it adds to the tension around PPE. But it comes back to the key question: what is necessary? And then using it appropriately.” Each procedure and each ward might require different levels of protection. In ITU patients might undergo aerosol procedures  which are more likely to spread Covid-19 particles through the air; hence the extra layers of protection worn by Billyard and his colleagues. Approximately 5 000 University hospital staff have so far been fit-tested for FFP3 masks since January and  though the hospital has plenty of PPE in stock  it relies on unpredictable army drops for replenishment. “We have to carefully manage it to ensure we have the longevity because this pandemic isn’t going to be finished next week ” Wells warns. Lei Dayrit  a nurse who worked at Hospital of St Cross in Rugby  University hospital’s sister hospital  died from Covid-19-related complications last week. She was one of several nurses who treated an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient who later became symptomatic. Her death was mourned on Thursday evening during the weekly “clap for carers” gathering outside University hospital  where a banner was unfurled in her honour. With tears in her eyes  the staff nurse Gail Hobley  a long-time colleague  said: “She was a special nurse to work with. Very caring  very supportive. We had a little discussion about Covid and she said everybody will look after each other  and we are. The support we have from everybody [in the community] is terrific.” In the hospital’s faith centre  the Rev John Matipano  one of the chaplains at University hospital  offers reassurance to those in need. “We’ve been doing rounds  supporting staff  and we’ve had staff say: ‘Please pray for us’ – something that you would never imagine happening given the way people are quite private about their faith ” he says. “Even if we don’t speak to staff  if you just go around ED and they see that a chaplain is here  they feel that someone cares  someone is there for them. Now  more than anything else  presence is very important.” Of all the heartbreak caused by Covid-19  nothing compares with the inability of families to see – and say goodbye to – their loved ones in person. Only in ITU can a dying patient receive one visitor. Some patients have  at least  been able to communicate with friends and family via video conferencing apps on tablets donated to the hospital. Wells found this especially moving when her grandfather was admitted with Covid-19. “He was able to tell my family he loved them and to sign goodbye via FaceTime before he died ” she says. “I knew the staff on the ward he was on. They were amazing. They stepped up and fulfilled a role that we weren’t able to fulfil. My mum feels happy that he was well loved and cared for.” Throughout the hospital  one unexpected sound punctuates the silence: laughter. In these dark times  a joke between colleagues provides a flicker of normality to offset the stress. Thierno Siedou Diallo  a cleaner  puts it simply: “You must come in and laugh. You give assurance to everybody.” In the medical decisions unit  Stacey Gavin  a band six sister in acute medicine  is sporting a “bride to be” sash. “I was supposed to be in Benidorm this weekend for my hen do. About 13 of us were going  a mixture of family and friends. Unfortunately it got cancelled about a month ago. So I said if I’m not going on my hen do  I’ll bring my hen do to work. “The girls put on a little celebration at break time in the staff room. They got Shloer  pretending to be champagne!” Like most staff  Gavin has offered to worked extra shifts  forgoing her annual leave. She and her colleagues are helped by a group of dedicated volunteers and charity workers  among them Ash Patini. “I lost my mum 17 years ago to terminal cancer and that absolutely changed my views on life what I wanted to do. She was made to feel very  very happy and comfortable here  right to the very end. It’s something I can never forget. “I promised myself that one day I would give something back. I kept that vision for 17 years [until taking early retirement]. And that’s why I’m back here; that’s why I do what I do.” The charity stock room is piled high with donations such as Easter eggs  crisps  sweets  fruit bars and toiletries. Elsewhere  local manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover have supplied visors for hospital staff  while many nurses have been given homemade headbands to alleviate the sores caused by wearing face masks. In preparation for the pandemic  significant changes were made throughout the hospital’s infrastructure: wards were repurposed  staff retrained  junior doctors given greater responsibilities  and strategies put in place to manage the trajectory of the disease. Kiran Patel  chief medical officer  says: “We’ve probably had about 20 years’ worth of transformation happen in the space of a month. And we’ve probably had over 135 year-one to year-three students  and about 150 graduates  who have basically just hit the ground running and been brilliant.” Following teleconferences with hospitals in China  Japan and Italy  University hospital has already prepared a reserve ITU ward of 32 beds and could raise capacity even higher  if needed. The hospital has also joined studies run by the World Health Organization. Nicolas Aldridge  lead nurse for research and development  says: “We’ve been looking at a mixture of anti-viral medications such as hydroxychloroquine  the anti-malaria medication. We’re gaining large numbers of patients for research because most of the existing research is only from small samples.” Questioned on Donald Trump’s recent support for the drug  despite limited evidence to support its efficacy in fighting Covid-19  Aldridge says diplomatically: “If we knew it would work  we wouldn’t be doing research on it.” “Historically  I think the last vaccine took 15 years to create. But technology has moved a huge distance since then and so has our understanding of how vaccines work. “When you step back at the end of the shift  you realise we’re doing something that’s of immense importance. We’re in a privileged job where we can try to find a treatment for it.” In the meantime  testing is critical. University hospital now has a dedicated swab-testing pod which can cater for up to 120 patients a day. Initially  testing was open to members of the public  but it has recently been scaled back to NHS staff and their families (members of the public can attend neighbouring centres). “It’s very quick  relatively painless. It’s just uncomfortable ” says the modern matron Amanda Jarvis. “It’s two swabs for an adult: nasal swab and throat – right at the back of the throat. It takes a couple of minutes.” Alex Mortimer  a paediatrician  has brought his four-year-old son  Leo Harris-Mortimer  for a test. Leo has had a dry cough for several days; Alex’s wife had previously displayed symptoms  too. “With this particular illness  the profile is that the older population are much more vulnerable to it  but there are a number of case studies that show children have been infected and have been affected badly. So it’s an important illness to take very seriously ” he says. The test result takes between 48 and 72 hours to arrive  meaning Mortimer could soon be back at work if his son gets the all clear. Were it not for this rapid testing  he would have to undergo a precautionary period of isolation  excluding him from service for weeks. Back in the dimly lit corridors surrounding ITU  nurses and consultants prepare to enter the highly infectious wards. Just like Billyard before them  they too must don – and later doff – every piece of equipment with the utmost precision  otherwise the risk of contaminating themselves  the safe zones and future patients is extreme. Yellow and black hazard tape marks the flooring – tread on the wrong side of it and you will be quickly admonished – and white plastic sheets with red zippers seal the outer perimeter of the changing zone. Each person who enters ITU is likely to stay inside for three hours or more before they take a 20-minute break. The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care  where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive. (The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU  it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS. Some viewers may find the following images distressing.) Roger Townsend is a clinical lead for ITU. “Working in the PPE is hot  uncomfortable  and because you can’t take your mask off in the critical care area  you can’t drink a glass of water ” he says. “There’s always the temptation to do one more job before you leave. So when you say to yourself: ‘I’ll wear this for two hours and then go out and have a drink and then come back in ’ you find sometimes three  four hours have gone by or even longer.” Inside ITU  many patients are in comas and connected to a vast array of machinery – ventilators  monitors  infusion pumps and sometimes dialysis machines – while groups of nurses and doctors check their vital signs. Heart monitors flicker and nurses confer; Billyard wanders the ward  scanning for problems. Many of the patients he surveys are middle-aged. Behind a curtain  a patient is flipped on to their front – a process known as “proning”. It takes five people to roll one patient. Each of them has their name written across their front and back  because there would be no other way to recognise who was who. In another bay  one of the few conscious patients is wearing a pressurised breathing apparatus. His head is entirely encased. “By the time a patient comes to critical care  they have got the kind of oxygen levels that you would have not quite half way up Mount Everest ” says Townsend  “and that’s on supplemental oxygen to push their oxygen levels up. If we didn’t intervene then the oxygen levels in their blood would fall away and they would die. The intervention that we do is essentially buying some time for mother nature to fix things.” The hospital has two ITU wards and Townsend  speaking earlier in the week when ITU was busier  revealed the scale of the challenge when he said: “Normally when we hand over at the end or beginning of the day  we might say that two or three patients are really sick  but we’ve got 15 or 16 patients on each unit who I would say fit that definition. You do go home shell-shocked.” Far away from the trauma of ITU  in a scientific laboratory filled with test tubes  refrigerators and unfathomable machines  Ranveer Singh Chaven  a bio medical scientist  is busy analysing results from Covid-19 swab tests. “Optimism is everything  otherwise you wouldn’t come to work. I’m sure I speak for everyone here at the hospital when I say we’ll work day and night.” He digs into his pocket and shows me an app on his phone. “I’ve got a timer on my phone ” he says. “This is how long it’s been since I’ve seen my mum and given her a hug  or kissed my niece goodnight: 24 days  10 hours  26 minutes  53 seconds.” He pauses  then adds: “I keep that with me just to keep me going.

20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/20/doves-hawks-uk-covid-19-lockdown-policy,politics, Who are the doves and hawks of UK's Covid-19 lockdown policy?, A look at where key figures stand  from a cautious PM to a chancellor eager to lift controls, Matt Hancock  health secretary Hancock has been an active proponent of continued lockdown to try to relieve pressure on the NHS and get the transmission rate as low as possible before easing restrictions. He has been vocal about the government not giving away its lockdown exit strategy as it might lead to people starting to disobey the rules. However  in virtual meetings involving some cabinet ministers he has been coming up against their concerns about the health and social impact of a sharp economic downturn and other consequences of lockdown such as escalating domestic abuse levels. Dominic Raab  foreign secretary  deputising as prime minister Raab is known to be instinctively in favour of a swift end to the lockdown but is also keeping his position close to that of the prime minister. He was leading the government at the time the decision was taken to extend lockdown measures by three weeks to 7 May  and was clear about the risks to the economy and the health of the nation if it was lifted too quickly. When pressed for a timeline  Raab pointed to Johnson’s remark of 19 March  that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide” of the virus  saying that was still “broadly the outline”. Alok Sharma  business secretary Originally considered to be part of the cabinet’s lockdown hawks  keen to get business back on its feet  Sharma has pivoted towards a more cautious stance  telling more than 1 000 business leaders in a webinar last Friday that he shared the PM’s concerns about a second wave. In his call  hosted by the Confederation of British Industry  he said lifting the lockdown too early could bring further setbacks to business because of a second peak of the illness and said “that’s the worst possible thing you could do”. Gavin Williamson  education secretary Williamson is another cabinet member who appears to have rowed back from an initial keenness to end lockdown. He had been described as a lockdown hawk because of his reported concern about the long-term effect that absence from school had on children and was keen to see a phased return to the classroom. However  a government source said the secretary of state totally dismissed suggestions he was part of the hawks group  and in a press conference on Sunday he did not give a date when schools would reopen. Rishi Sunak  chancellor Sunak has privately been making the case for as quick an end to the lockdown as possible to limit damage to the economy  viewing it as part of his job to speak up about the financial risks of a lengthy shutdown. Internal Treasury projections about the scale of business bankruptcies  unemployment and the depth of the recession to come have caused worries among cabinet ministers. He hinted at this last week in a No 10 press conference  saying he was “deeply troubled” by the effect on the economy. However  sources close to him have also been keen to stress that his first priority is saving lives and protecting the NHS in line with the government’s overarching message. Michael Gove  Cabinet Office minister Gove has been growing increasingly concerned about the economic impact of the lockdown and knock-on consequences for the health of the nation  according to Whitehall sources. He is one of the most outspoken of the four decision-makers in the so-called Quad – along with Raab  Sunak and Hancock – about finding ways to relax restrictions  and is leading a strategic unit in the Cabinet Office to look at ways to get the country moving again. Last week  he was reported by the Sunday Times to have told a meeting of the Quad that he wanted to “run things quite hot” – meaning he would be prepared to lift restrictions as soon as the transmission rate had lowered. One person close to him said they did not recognise the idea of different camps within cabinet and stressed he was supportive of the scientific advice. Liz Truss  international trade secretary Truss believes that restoring global trade as quickly as possible could be a key way to support the country economically and she would be keen to see lockdown restrictions lifted incrementally sooner rather than later. She is continuing to keep up contact with Singapore  Australia and other G20 countries to hammer home that trade with the UK is vitally important for financial recovery. She is not alone in her views within cabinet  with suggestions that anyone with an “economic department” is naturally aligned with her position. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d4fabd52e8ccec55c7c4ec388c33363b4ac54f/0_224_2775_1665/master/2775.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8bbeefb3636416a964eba4208dcbf82c https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBoris+Johnson%2CMatt+Hancock%2CRishi+Sunak%2CConservatives%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/fierce-rebuttals-mark-change-to-uk-covid-19-media-strategy,world, Fierce rebuttals mark change to UK Covid-19 media strategy, Lancet editor accuses No 10 of ‘rewriting history in disinformation campaign’, The responses to stories in the Sunday Times and Financial Times  posted to the government’s website without an author credit  are unlikely to reach anything like the audiences who read the original articles – but suggest deep concern in Whitehall regarding criticism of the handling of the pandemic. Furious government rebuttals of press stories are nothing new  nor is the practice of posting them to an official website. The difference this time is the manner in which the authors of the pieces dedicated themselves to going through each piece so meticulously. One response was to a widely shared piece by the Sunday Times Insight team  which built the case that Britain wasted five weeks in appreciating the threat of the virus due to mismanagement and a focus on Brexit at the top of government. Sources said those involved in the “team effort” to respond to the piece included some of Boris Johnson’s political aides  one of Matt Hancock’s key advisers  and a number of government officials  who worked throughout the day to challenge some of the points made in the piece. While some of the rebuttals were over semantics  others focused on specifics. One point complained that when the Sunday Times criticised the government for allowing 279 000 items of protective equipment to be sent from the UK to China in the early days of the outbreak  the newspaper failed to point out that 12m items had since come back in the other direction. However  government ministers may find that doing their own journalism is an equally fraught process. One of those quoted in the government’s rebuttal was Richard Horton  editor of the Lancet medical journal. Horton himself is now rebutting the rebuttal  accusing the government of “deliberately rewriting history in its ongoing Covid-19 disinformation campaign”. The second piece that angered ministers was an article by Peter Foster in the Financial Times  which criticised the government’s attempts to persuade industry to build new ventilators for hospitals. In a sign of changing attitudes to media  the government’s 2 900-word rebuttal to this piece focused as much on Foster’s tweets about the story as the original piece – potentially recognising that the number of people who read an individual article on a news website can often be smaller than the number of people who see a Twitter thread. Although both rebuttals were widely shared in political and journalism circles on Twitter  they are unlikely to reach a mass audience. The original Sunday Times piece already clocked in at just over 5 000 words. The government’s response – setting out what they claimed to be a “series of falsehoods and errors” in a piece that “actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work that was going on in government at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak” – was 2 000 words long. Instead  a recently departed government press aide speculated that the real purpose may have been to blunt the impact of the critical narrative taking hold in other outlets and being repeated by broadcast news outlets that reach millions of people. A government source said they had always responded to articles perceived to be inaccurate: “The length of our rebuttal depends on how much we have to correct and how much any article misrepresents what’s actually going on.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af5513c2f737babab0e27441d163a54ee477ed2/902_0_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14a7a2caa49bd83766d6ebb146e3c10f https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CMedia%2CSunday+Times%2CFinancial+Times%2CNational+newspapers%2CNewspapers%2CUK+news%2CPolitics https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/raf-planes-await-order-to-set-off-to-collect-ppe-from-turkey,society, RAF plane sent to pressure Turkey to release gowns for NHS, UK government makes desperate move to force export of PPE it promised for Sunday, The plane  one of three that have been waiting to be dispatched to pick up the shipment of 400 000 protective gowns for NHS staff  took off from RAF Brize Norton on Monday despite earlier ministerial assurances that the matter was on the brink of being resolved. By the time the flight took off there was no indication from the Turkish authorities that the equipment had been approved for export. The RAF transport planes have been on standby at Brize Norton for days waiting for the go-ahead to pick up 84 tonnes of urgently needed medical clothing and equipment  including the 400 000 gowns made by Turkish suppliers. With a series of deadlines set by UK ministers missed  the British government has blamed its Turkish counterpart for causing the delays. But after one cabinet minister said the government had hoped the three planes would be able to take off on Monday afternoon  British sources admitted that the Turkish authorities had not confirmed the supplies were ready to be picked up. Instead  the RAF was ordered to put one of the three transport planes – an Atlas A400M – into the air in the hope that it would help speed up the process on the ground in Turkey  even though it would not be able to pick up all the ordered equipment on its own. “We call it pre-positioning ” a military source said. The flight time from London to Turkey for the planes is a little under five hours  meaning that the gowns and other supplies cannot arrive into the UK until Tuesday at the earliest  although ministers had previously promised the transport would take place on Sunday. The culture secretary  Oliver Dowden  told the BBC on Monday morning that the delays were down to “challenges at the Turkish end” but appeared to suggest the issue was about to be resolved. He said: “I don’t want to start making more and more promises  but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered.” NHS officials expressed disappointment that the delivery timetable announced by ministers had slipped again  having on Sunday urged the government to avoid making pledges of equipment that it could not be sure of fulfilling. Chris Hopson  the chief executive of NHS Providers  said: “It’s disappointing that having raised expectations about the additional PPE consignment coming from Turkey  there is still no sign of it. “We have called on the government and national leaders to be careful about announcing information about consignments of PPE from overseas until they know they have arrived  are unpacked and the kit has been checked to ensure it passes our safety tests.” At the Downing Street briefing on Monday afternoon  the chancellor  Rishi Sunak  acknowledged the issue  but did not give any further updates on when the gowns might now be received. “We are working to resolve the Turkish shipment of PPE as soon as possible following some unexpected delays at the weekend ” Sunak said. He noted that 140 000 gowns had arrived from Myanmar and said that “every possible option” was being explored. Three dozen crew for the mission had been previously told to expect takeoff “in the late afternoon”  according to defence sources. The other planes in the intended transport were another Atlas A400M and a C-17 Globemaster  the largest of the three. Along with many countries  Turkey has banned the export of PPE and other vital medical supplies without government approval  leading to several cases of lengthy delays. The shipment was originally due to arrive on Sunday  the third such shipment to arrive from Turkey this year. Turkey’s presidency did not immediately respond to several requests for comment on the reasons behind the delays in allowing the equipment to be picked up. According to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera  an order of 200 000 Turkish-made masks was held up for 17 days last month until Italy’s prime minister  Giuseppe Conte  raised the matter in a phone call with the Turkish president  Recep Tayyip Erdo?an. On 3 April the Spanish government accused Turkey of holding on to a shipment containing dozens of respirators  citing efforts by Turkish officials to shore up their own supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. The shipment was released the next day after Ankara agreed to exempt the cargo from the export ban. Five million masks sold by Turkish companies to Belgium before the export ban were also delayed  leading Belgium’s health ministry to file a criminal complaint. Turkey  a major medical equipment manufacturer  stepped up production when the Covid-19 outbreak reached neighbouring Iran. Turkey did not confirm its first case until 11 March. Since then the rate of infection in the country has become one of the highest in the world.

20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-doctor-ppe-protest-downing-street-london,society, 'They can't get away with this': doctor who took protest to No 10, UK health workers’ deaths could be avoided with adequate PPE  says Meenal Viz, The “something” was to put on her scrubs and drive to Downing Street from her home in London with a homemade placard saying “Protect Healthcare Workers”. For two hours  she set up a lonely vigil outside the gates  a silent protest at the daily-mounting toll of healthcare workers who have died of Covid-19 – a toll that reached 100 deaths on Monday. “I wanted to show the government  show the public  that this is not OK. And we will not stay silent. These deaths are being normalised. But there is nothing normal about it. It’s become normal not to have PPE or to accept that the guidelines about what’s required is based on supply  not the science. It’s become normal to see healthcare workers dying. But it’s not normal. And we will step up and speak out ” Viz said. “It was such a stark difference  standing there in the sunshine. You know the people making decisions are there inside these beautiful buildings. But we are seeing life and death. We are fighting for aprons. Outside  you can believe that everything is OK. I even probably fooled myself – but then you come home and it’s another 800 dead. It’s why I had to do this now.” Viz’s protest was captured by an AP photographer and appeared on newspaper front pages. She had a plan for what to do if she got arrested  but hadn’t thought much further than that. And though she doesn’t want to say where she works or name her hospital trust – she says the issue is a national one – she is determined to speak out. The difficulty of doing so has spurred her on  with NHS trusts warning staff that they could face disciplinary action if they speak to the press. “We are being silenced. In our own hospitals. By our own managers. A lot of people are afraid for their own safety but they’re also afraid of losing their jobs. Some of them have visas tied to their work or families to feed. There’s just an awful lot of pressure not to. I thought  who’s going to listen to me? I’m a south Asian woman  a pregnant woman. I thought  ‘Will anyone listen to me?’ But I thought  I just have to at least try.” The tipping point came last week with the death of Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong  a pregnant nurse who  at 28  was just a year older than Viz. “I didn’t sleep when I heard. And I cried. I cried a lot. I said  who is going to speak for her? Is she going to be just another statistic? “All I could think about was her daughter in ICU with no idea who her mother is. Her mother had given her life to the NHS. I thought  how can I sit back and let her be just be another number? And this is happening to so many other families. And it is not OK. They just can’t get away with this. We knew this was coming. We are not children asking for Christmas presents. We are asking for help protecting our safety so that we can protect the public.” Until the beginning of the crisis  Viz was working on an acute ward and came into contact with suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients. She asked to be moved and is now in a different part of the hospital  but she is still expected to show up to work. “Pregnant women are high-risk. They are supposed to be home  but it depends hospital to hospital and the guidance is for third trimester only. But there is so much we don’t know about this virus. And they are making up policies as they go along. I really don’t know what I’ve exposed myself or my unborn child to.” Britain could end up with the highest toll of dead healthcare workers in the world  Viz believes  and she no longer trusts the government’s promises. “This was avoidable. These are unnecessary deaths. It’s not a ‘war’. This is a health crisis. This is systemic negligence. I’m not a warrior. And none of us should have to ‘sacrifice’ ourselves to do our jobs. “The support of the public has been amazing. It really helps us to show up and carry on. But no amount of clapping or badges is going to bring Mary back. This just has to end now.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/03/21/Carole_Cadwalladr,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3090286ae5ebc140c173a4908d41b46f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf8582e5844c9b14d15015e1eb623caac1f4eb0/402_446_4067_2441/master/4067.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6df07f8a4ab79d6b99033547b6a34ae2 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a222485361b7ba47e28ce2475e3e6c8e69f4267a/871_0_3339_2002/master/3339.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72141b1306acdfa85d54fde2007dffb5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dcf9ca8dd3c11958f004763440d185ca68ad84d/0_47_3311_1986/master/3311.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6258b9dd4065a21792f41ebc53a5d4e1 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CHealth+policy%2CMatt+Hancock%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CDoctors%2CNursing%2CMidwifery%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CPolitics%2CPublic+services+policy%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show,world, At least 100 UK health workers have died from coronavirus  figures show, Concerns grow over lack of PPE for NHS workers on the frontline as milestone reached, The number of nurses  doctors  porters and members of other professions who have died has been catalogued by Nursing Notes  a platform run by nurses for others in the profession. They announced that at 2pm GMT a milestone had been reached with at least 100 health and social care workers now believed to have died. The website has been recording all deaths since the outbreak began  verifying all the information they receive using a number of independent sources and permissions sought from family  friends or colleagues. The government has publicly verified 27 deaths of NHS staff from Covid-19 during the pandemic. Among those who have died are Linda Clarke  who worked as a delivery suite coordinator at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. She had worked in the maternity service for 30 years  with trust chiefs saying she had “brought many new lives into the borough”. In a statement  Silas Nicholls  the chief executive at Wrightington  Wigan and Leigh NHS trust  said: “We can sadly confirm that a member of our staff  Linda Clarke  tragically passed away on 17 April. Linda was 66 and worked in our maternity service for 30 years  bringing many new lives into our borough and caring for expectant mums in our community.” Ade Dickson  a mental health nurse for the Barnet crisis resolution and home treatment team  also died. A spokesperson from Barnet  Enfield and Haringey mental health trust said: “We are very sad to confirm the loss of our colleague and friend Ade Dickson due to coronavirus.” They added: “Ade was a highly respected colleague who will be deeply missed by his family  friends  trust staff and patients. We ask that you please respect their privacy at this difficult time.” The Guardian has also been recording the deaths of NHS staff and has written tributes for 81  with the number continuing to be updated as more names come in. Over the weekend  hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during the coronavirus crisis over the shortage of PPE after a desperately needed consignment of surgical gowns that had been announced by ministers failed to arrive. In an unprecedented intervention  which hospital leaders privately say is the result of “intense frustration and exasperation”  the organisations representing NHS trusts in England urged ministers to “just focus on what we can be certain of” after weeks of “bitter experience” with failed deliveries. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers spoke out amid continuing alarm that shortages of equipment will soon have disastrous effects on the frontline  with representatives of intensive care staff warning on Sunday that the critical shortage of PPE could lead to some people refusing to continue working there. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd55559332c507c02f5a0855618742ac9ba2ec11/0_236_3081_1848/master/3081.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e95d9c1b7b1d19200c4b8a46ffc7716 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CNHS%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CSocial+care https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/20/the-upside-of-lockdown-copycats-and-crooners-lift-the-spirits,news, The upside of lockdown: copycats and crooners lift the spirits, Capt Tom Moore’s fundraising feat inspires others around the country to follow suit, Capt Tom Moore’s now almost legendary fundraising effort  in which he raised more than £26.5m for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden  has inspired a string of copycats. Among them is 90-year-old Margaret Payne  who has set out to climb the equivalent of a Highland mountain by taking repeated trips up and down her stairs  and 91-year-old Welsh farmer Rhythwyn Evans  who is pledging to walk 91 laps around the exterior of his bungalow. Ben  11  from Lincoln has completed the National Three Peaks Challenge by climbing the equivalent of 3 408 metres – the combined height of Ben Nevis  Snowdon and Scafell Pike – in just over 17 hours on his stairs. He has raised more than £3 000 by going up and down his stairs 1 704 times  according to the BBC. Six-year-old Hector Dee  from Wetherby in Yorkshire  is walking six miles in six days to raise money for frontline workers  while nine-year-old Amelia Davies from Leeds bounced on her trampoline for a total of 24-hours over the course of a weekend. She only took breaks to use the toilet  eat and sleep. Former Scotland rugby captain Mike Biggar  from Wiltshire  has also set himself a challenge. The 70-year-old  who has used a wheelchair since a car accident in 1992 left him with brain damage  is attempting to walk 100 steps in 30 days  with the help of his bars  to raise money for the NHS. Fifty-nine-year-old Rudo Moyo  who lost his sight to measles at the age of four  is similarly walking 260 laps of his garden in Washington  Tyne and Wear  over 10 days. Appearing on Good Morning Britain with his daughter on Monday morning  Tom Moore described the response to his fundraiser for the NHS as “rather like being in fairyland”. Hannah Ingram-Moore  said: “Our life has changed in the last five days. Every day something extraordinary happens … We simply remain a happy family and utterly humbled by the support of the public.” This weekend saw some of the biggest names in music – from Lady Gaga to the Rolling Stones – perform to millions from their front rooms as part of the The One World: Together at Home concert. But there were also some less known acts attracting huge audiences online. Mark Summers  an Elvis performer  said he was humbled after a live-streamed event on Saturday evening – in which he sang requests from his home in the West Midlands – racked up 75 000 views and raised more than £13 000 for the NHS. People tuned in from as far a field as Dubai and Thailand. Summers sang Elvis classics like Suspicious Minds  Don’t Be Cruel and Always on my Mind  and played a specially recorded message of support from Sir Cliff Richard saying: “The NHS is the greatest  Elvis was the greatest  they go really well together.” Writing on his Facebook page  Summers said he had received messages from people saying they had felt depressed  lonely  and isolated from family  and that the performance had made them feel better. “Elvis’s music is so powerful it brings all age groups together  its fun  it’s moving and so much more ” he said. Meanwhile beef farmer Andrew Sheldon from Draycott in Somerset has been dubbed the Somerset Crooner after sharing videos of himself singing on Facebook. Each song is dedicated to the NHS and frontline workers  and some recordings have had as many as 50 000 views in two hours. “With all this coronavirus and that going on  there’s a lot of lonely people out there  sad people  one thing and the other  and I thought I’d like to lift people’s spirits up a bit ” he told the BBC. Championship football club West Bromwich Albion have donated their stadium for use as a maternity clinic  so that expectant mothers can avoid hospital visits during the coronavirus crisis. The club has started providing free space in the East Stand suites at The Hawthorns stadium to deliver antenatal and postnatal care. Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust said three clinics would be held Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm  and would be staffed by 10 midwives and three support workers. Helen Hurst  director of midwifery at the trust  said: “We wanted to provide an alternative space for women who are having antenatal and postnatal care. Women are slightly anxious about coming to hospital in the current climate so we wanted to find a safe space away from the hospital.” She added: “We are really grateful to the Baggies for providing this space for women during this worrying time.” There has been a mixed response to a suggestion by the actor Idris Elba that the world should take a week of quarantine every year to “remember this time” once the pandemic is over. Elba  who starred in Luther and the Wire  told the Associated Press: “I think that the world should take a week of quarantine every year just to remember this time. Remember each other. I really do. I think it’s … other species use it. It’s called hibernation. But it does remind you that the world doesn’t tick on your time.” Responding to the comment  one Twitter user said: “The world should go to war for a week to remember WW2.” Elba announced last month that he had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms. He attended the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside Sophie Grégoire Trudeau  the wife of the Canadian prime minister  who also tested positive for the virus. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/12/26/Frances_Perraudin,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=379873bd915887b1f7cdd0f90779456c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87100a0f31c68101a6a0d7bdf60cadf14d96d384/0_559_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e26310557177512fec7ca48dbda41442 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=World+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/20/just-not-true-were-too-lazy-for-farm-work-say-frustrated-uk-applicants,money, 'Just not true' we're too lazy for farm work  say frustrated UK applicants, Jobseekers take issue with pay and terms and allege farmers favouring migrant labour, Dozens of workers have expressed anger at claims they are too lazy or picky to take the jobs  alleging that farmers are favouring cheap migrant labour. Offers of on-site accommodation in which three or four workers share a caravan were among the most frequent complaints on social media and in emails to the Guardian  after reports that thousands of British workers had turned down jobs and Romanians were being flown in to pick salad. Chay Honey  in Bristol  whose work on festivals has disappeared  said the pay and conditions of the farm work were difficult to justify. “I live with my fiance and to live on site would mean I would only have one day a week for friends and family. They also said you can’t use your own vehicle  which makes getting out to the shops difficult. Very quickly the romance of going to work for a farm to help provide food for the nation has become very unattractive ” he said. “It seems it is very much geared up for migrant labour. We are not looking for special treatment  but the whole system needs to have some flexibility and not just have this blanket approach.” Genevieve Black  in south Wales  said she had been unsuccessful in applications for 10 jobs despite being willing to live on site in Kent  Hampshire or Scotland. “The idea that Brits are just too lazy to work on farms is just not true ” she said. She is part of a Facebook group  Jobs for Camper Nomads  which is awash with criticism of the farming industry. One poster suggested that farmers could allow applicants with their own camper vans to live on site. “We are forever being told these are unprecedented times and we are all in it together. UK berry farmers not so much! I am sure with a bit of thought a workable solution can be found.” Alison Harrow  an England Athletics running coach seeking farm work  said she was feeling “really discouraged”. “I’ve applied for 200 jobs and you either get ‘We’ve got enough people now’ or you don’t hear anything back ” she said. “Well  if they have jobs coming up at the end of May or June  why don’t they just allocate those now and just confirm a job? “I get an email from one farm worker recruitment agency saying I have not been shortlisted. How can this be? There seems to be a mismatch between demand for workers and matching workers to farm work.” Nick Marston  the chair of British Summer Fruits  said the business model of fruit farming had been “structured around a non-UK workforce for many years” because UK workers had shunned the work: “Farms are receiving large numbers of applications and I think it would be unfair to say the industry is not accommodating local workforce.” He appealed for patience among the army of would-be-pickers  saying the season had barely started and that there would be surge in job opportunities at the end of May and June. Tom Bradshaw  vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union  said he could understand why people felt frustrated over the lack of job offers. “In a way  the media publicity has come a bit too soon  because the jobs don’t peak until the end of May and June ” he said. He added that a national website that “would act as a centralised hub for all recruiters” was expected to launch later this week  which would make it easier to match supply to demand. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5934b34ea6987763dc627b989c95bdb6a40189/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=351232960916f0908984d2accb46c971 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Work+%26+careers%2CFarming%2CMoney%2CFood%2CMigration%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/uk-trial-coronavirus-treatments-using-blood-from-survivors,society, UK to trial coronavirus treatments using blood from survivors, Two clinical trials aim to give transfusions to ailing patients to bolster immune systems, NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has started to collect blood from recovered patients with a view to using the antibody-rich serum to boost the immune systems of patients struggling to overcome the virus. The limited supply of convalescent plasma will be given to patients enrolled on sub-studies in the Recovery trial led by Peter Horby at the University of Oxford  and the Remap-Cap trial led by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) in London. The Recovery trial will assess whether the plasma helps patients to recover before they are admitted to intensive care  while the Remap-Cap trial will investigate whether similar transfusions help to save patients who are already in high-dependency or intensive care units. At least one trial that was designed to assess whether the plasma could protect healthy people who are in close contact with Covid-19 patients  such as NHS staff and family members  was rejected by NHSBT amid a shortage of the donated serum. Convalescent plasma therapy dates back more than a century and was used in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The treatment relies on the presence of antibodies that provide some level of immunity to patients who have recovered from the virus. The most effective transfusions contain high levels of antibodies that can  in principle  boost the recipient’s immune defences for weeks. Doctors in China used convalescent plasma as an emergency therapy when the outbreak was raging on the mainland  and while early anecdotal evidence suggests it may have helped  formal clinical trials are needed to determine whether the intervention is really safe and effective  and that patients would not have recovered as well without it. In the US  where the number of reported coronavirus cases is greater than in any other country  doctors have rapidly expanded a trial of convalescent plasma which has been given to hundreds of patients. NHSBT is seeking blood donations from patients aged 17 to 66 who recovered at least 28 days ago  the time it takes to be certain that persistent antibodies are in the bloodstream. Donations can be made at 23 centres across England. Prof Sir Robert Lechler  the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences and executive director of King’s Health Partners  which includes King’s College London and three major London hospitals  is keen to trial the therapy and has been contacted directly by recovered patients who want to know how to donate their blood. “Convalescent plasma transfusions are not a silver bullet solution for the coronavirus health crisis; however  they do have the potential to be hugely beneficial. The US has charged ahead with this. They have already treated 500 patients with convalescent plasma  and although it is much too soon to know the results  anecdotally it has helped patients recover.” Beyond the therapeutic uses being looked at in the trials  if the transfusions are found to be safe and effective  and if the supply from donors allows  the plasma could also be used in care homes to prevent people who test positive from developing the most serious form of the disease  he said. “There is an urgent need for this kind of intervention. Let’s hope we can start treating patients with this very  very soon.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c002cda58535b2e8e37032eec18a3f9840f8ddf/0_463_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c37ec478a56c27adc4909c4dfb80936 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CMedical+research%2CScience%2CInfectious+diseases%2CNHS%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/german-shops-open-angela-merkel-warns-second-wave-coronavirus,world, Germany opens some shops as Merkel warns of second wave of coronavirus, Chancellor cautions against lifting lockdown too quickly saying infections could spike, Bookshops  florists  fashion stores  bike and car outlets and other shops smaller than 800 sq m were permitted to reopen on Monday morning. In Berlin a few schools allowed final-year students to sit exams. Pupils arrived wearing face-masks and took their seats at widely spaced desks. Angela Merkel  however  warned of a possible second wave of coronavirus infection if lockdown measures were abandoned too rapidly. The chancellor urged citizens to stay “determined” and said it would be a “crying shame” if the country which has been praised for its deft handling of the crisis fell into a “relapse”. In a video call with party colleagues Merkel said the “discussion orgies” taking place in some German federal states on relaxing curbs on were unhelpful She said she was “greatly concerned” the public might let its guard down. Nonetheless  the clear trend across Europe is now towards some form of normalisation. Norway’s government reopened nurseries on Monday after a month-long closure. It said this was possible because children were less affected by Covid-19  adding that the virus was under control. “Going to pre-school is safe ” Norway’s education minister  Guri Melby  declared. Some parents  however  have criticised the move – a sentiment also seen in Denmark  where primary schools reopened last week. A Norwegian Facebook group called “My child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19” has gathered nearly 30 000 signatures. Polls suggest around a quarter of Norwegian parents do not want to send their children back to pre-school. In Poland parks and forests returned to normal on Monday  while in the Czech Republic open-air markets were allowed to resume as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions. “This is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest ” vegetable grower Milan Vystejn told Reuters  at his stand in Prague’s Tylovo Square. Austria has already reopened some shops. It plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May. All three countries have seen significantly fewer coronavirus deaths than the worst affected countries in Europe: Italy  Spain  France and the UK. All European leaders are battling with the same dilemma: how to prevent a renewed outbreak of the virus while at the same time maintaining public confidence  as poorer citizens run out of cash and national economies nosedive. There are growing signs of unrest. Over the weekend police in Berlin struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning against the lockdown. Among them were anti-vaxxers  well known conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists  some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. In France  meanwhile  there was unrest in the Paris suburb of Villeneuve-La-Garenne  after a motorcyclist collided with the open door of an unmarked police car during a pursuit. Skirmishes lasted into the early hours of Sunday and resumed again on Monday. Protesters burned cars and hurled fireworks at police  whom they accuse of heavy-handed behaviour. In the Russian city of Vladikavkaz  meanwhile  demonstrators protested against the local authorities and the country’s continuing lockdown. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters pelting the police with rocks  and police making several arrests. On Monday France’s prime minister  Édouard Philippe  said nurseries  primary and secondary schools would reopen on 11 May. Philippe said the French government was considering options to implement the policy  including having half a class in rotation  or first opening schools in areas where there had been few or no Covid-19 cases. However  he warned the French not to plan too far ahead  saying weddings  parties  and travel outside of France were not immediately on the cards. “I don’t have answers today … given the barrier rules  it doesn’t seem reasonable that a marriage of say 200 people gathered in a confined place is to be envisaged. For how long I don’t know ” Philippe admitted. In Spain  with nearly 200 000 confirmed cases and more than 20 000 deaths  the authorities have said they will hold off lifting restrictions. The rate of infection appears to be going down. The country reported 399 coronavirus deaths over the past 48 hours  lower than Sunday’s figure of 410. Spain’s prime minister  Pedro Sánchez  is expected to ask parliament on Tuesday to extend a national lockdown until 11 May. He has proposed that from 27 April children under the age of 12 should be allowed out for exercise – but not teenagers.

Whilst Trost said he was looking forward to “something of the eerie mood in the empty streets” disappearing  he said he also had some trepidation about the move  which will see small shops of up to 800 sq m reopen. “I’m quite nervous about the relaxation of the rules in that I’m concerned that people will no longer take the illness seriously  and we could soon end up with another lockdown ” the customer service adviser for Berlin Water Works said. “The sense of solidarity which was obvious at the beginning is starting to disintegrate. And as long as I can’t hug my friends  I won’t feel that life is anything like normal.” Simon  one of 10 000 secondary school students in the state of Brandenburg due to take their exams on Monday  under strict hygiene and physical distancing rules  said he was glad that he was being allowed to sit exams at all after some authorities discussed rewarding exam certificates based on average marks instead. “I didn’t fancy being labelled my whole life as being one of those forced to get the ‘emergency Abitur’ ” he said  ahead of a geography exam and sipping on a latte bought from a cafe selling drinks from behind a perspex window in its doorway. “Even though it’s been an uncertain few weeks  which might affect my performance  I’m glad to have the proper chance to show what I can do. Though the situation is far from normal ” he added. Kerstin Seefeldt was stacking the shelves of her Babelsberg bookshop  Script  eagerly preparing for a reopening on Wednesday. “I’m really looking forward to seeing my customers properly again ” she said. “I’m organising the shop so that the tables of books are like a labyrinth and customers can avoid coming into contact with each other.” Only two customers will be allowed at a time in the 30 sq m space  she said. Seefeldt ran a thrice-daily bicycle delivery service for customers during the shutdown. “It has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity. But I know that the situation is far from normal  and so I will now keep up the delivery service for people considered to be in a risk category because I’m aware that things cannot go back to normal for a long time yet  even if the shop is able to open ” she said. She added she was relieved to have been helped through a financially difficult period by a government investment grant of €9000  news of which had reached her that morning. The German chancellor  Angela Merkel  urged Germans on Monday to remain “disciplined and watchful”  and warned that if attitudes towards the pandemic relaxed too quickly  another tougher lockdown may follow. “We must not lose track of the fact that we continue to be at the start of this pandemic and are far from out of the woods ” she said. Thanking Germans for – by and large – sticking to the rules of staying at home and keeping physical distance  Merkel said a lot had so far been achieved. “The infection is under control to the extent that it is not climbing exponentially any more ” she said. But a “rash easing” of the restrictions was in danger of unleashing the “unknown”  she warned. Acknowledging the plight of many people  including artists  single parents and restaurant managers Merkel said Germans should not be “lulled into a false sense of security”. If the infection rate began to rise – which would first be visible in the statistics in two weeks’ time – “a new shutdown would be unavoidable” and that had to be prevented for the sake of the economy  she said. But there are signs that social tensions are rising in parts of the country  and the sense that this is a critical moment in tackling the virus is keenly felt. At the weekend  police struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning on Berlin’s Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz against what they saw as constraints placed on their basic rights due to the so-called Corona Verordnungen  or regulations. Amongst the protesters were anti-vaxxers  well-known conspiracy theorists  and rightwing extremists  some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. Other similar demonstrations have taken place elsewhere across Germany. By Monday afternoon German health authorities had reported a total of 146 000 confirmed infections and 4735 deaths. The reproduction rate was slightly higher than on Friday  at 0.8  but anything under one is being considered a success by decision-makers. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab3361b547cc0113ab31c011c753c0c91d07b51/0_14_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=602f4b65de7f365bef5ce99ea923905c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06e8ab8bd8ed24460805efab3db9c0adb08f767/0_225_600_360/master/600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18cf995403912bf083e837358ad61581 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7495f68b9f727a85302228405900bcfb18d6d0f0/0_59_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1df7f229939e304fbc37dfd240dc0887 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CGermany%2CEurope%2CRetail+industry%2CBusiness https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/studies-suggest-very-few-have-had-covid-19-without-symptoms,society, WHO warns that few have developed antibodies to Covid-19, Herd immunity hopes dealt blow by report suggesting only 2%-3% of people have been infected, “Easing restrictions is not the end of the epidemic in any country ” said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a media briefing in Geneva on Monday. “So-called lockdowns can help to take the heat out of a country’s epidemic.” But serological testing to find out how large a proportion of the population have had the infection and developed antibodies to it – which it is hoped will mean they have some level of immunity – suggests that the numbers are low. “Early data suggests that a relatively small percentage of the populations may have been infected ” Tedros said. “Not more than 2%-3%.” Dr Maria Van Kerkhove  an American infectious diseases expert who is the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19  said they had thought the number of people infected would be higher  but she stressed it was still too early to be sure. “Initially  we see a lower proportion of people with antibodies than we were expecting ” she said. “A lower number of people are infected.” On Friday  a study carried out in Santa Clara  California by Stanford University and released as a “pre-print” without peer review  found that 50 to 85 times more people had been infected with the virus than official figures showed. Santa Clara county had 1 094 confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the time the study was carried out  but antibody tests suggest that between 48 000 and 81 000 people had been infected by early April  most of whom did not develop symptoms. But even those high figures mean that within the whole population of the county  only 3% have been infected and have antibodies to the virus. A study in the Netherlands of 7 000 blood donors also found that just 3% had antibodies. Van Kerkhove said they needed to look carefully at the way the studies were being carried out. “A number of studies we are aware of in pre-print have suggested that small proportions of the population [have antibodies] ” she said. These were “in single digits  up to 14% in Germany and France”. “It is really important to understand how the studies were done.” That would include asking how they found the people to test. Was it at random or were they blood donors  who tend to be healthy adults? They would also need to look at how well the blood tests were performed. “We are working with a number of countries carrying out these serology studies ” she added. The WHO-supported studies would use robust methods and the tests would be validated for accuracy. The hope will be that people who have had Covid-19 will be able to resume their lives. But Van Kerkhove last week said that even if tests showed a person had antibodies  it did not prove that they were immune. “There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity ” she said. “Right now  we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.” • The headline and opening paragraph of this article were amended on 20 April 2020 to clarify that the 2%-3% figure cited by the WHO referred to the population as a whole. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bb839edac40697817f021279e0d5ed84c41097/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9faf31758b9b104481b05aefb754a257 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee3c4b1300d0bb500c05cecfb481fb00b3968d4/0_161_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66b3d665ce0b5d0fad89d63bb54f0ad4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b33f27f254682d7b68d509570c30e8d8afcda/0_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52df9aeb22cab1280788b513faa49b17 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c883acc089ff49d7d0909793e57a67145efdd7c/0_432_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a340bea3ad07b5197974a27ec1ee61bb https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Health%2CSociety%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CScience%2CWorld+news%2CWorld+Health+Organization https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/20/imperial-college-london-warns-of-cuts-in-face-of-coronavirus,education, Imperial College London warns of cuts in face of coronavirus, Recruitment and capital projects on hold amid plans to furlough staff  says email, In an email to staff last week  Prof Alice Gast  the college president  said she was taking a voluntary 20% pay cut as she announced a raft of cost-cutting measures  including the suspension of capital projects  a freeze on recruitment and plans to furlough staff members. Imperial is one one of the jewels in the crown of the UK’s higher education sector. Prof Neil Ferguson  of its faculty of medicine and school of public health  is one of the epidemiologists advising the government on Covid-19  and his team provided the modelling that led to the lockdown. It is not  however  immune to the effects of the pandemic. Analysis suggests UK universities are likely to be one of the hardest hit sectors  with fears that international students will not return and the possible loss of tens of thousands of Chinese students next year resulting in gaping holes in budgets. Gast told staff she was proud of the significant impact of Imperial’s research  clinical care and public outreach on the pandemic  but warned: “The immediate need  as we face threats to enrolments and the financial burden of the shutdown  is to look for ways to conserve cash in the coming year. “We have already taken important decisions to suspend starting or approving new capital projects  limiting ongoing staff recruitment and identifying roles eligible for the furloughing scheme … We need to consider further measures.” Gast said Imperial’s provost  Prof Ian Walmsley  would also be taking a 20% pay cut and that the board had volunteered for a pay reduction of 10% over the next six months. “Our intention is to share some of the many sacrifices our community is making by volunteering  working on the front line or having their laboratory or workplace closed. This money will be used to help our students and staff in hardship.” Imperial is the latest of a number of higher education institutions to announce cuts or restructuring. Last week the University and College Union (UCU) condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the pandemic. Earlier this month it emerged that hundreds of university staff on precarious contracts had been dismissed in an effort to cut costs. Staff on fixed-term contracts  including visiting lecturers  researchers and student support workers  at Bristol  Newcastle and Sussex universities were made redundant or told their employment would or may end prematurely. Imperial has benefited from large numbers of international students in recent years  with 64% of the student body coming from outside the UK in 2017/18  of which Chinese students were the biggest non-UK nationality. The UCU’s general secretary  Jo Grady  said: “It is extremely concerning that any universities are using the current pandemic to look at changes to jobs and staffing levels. Staff are working extremely hard in difficult circumstances and university job losses will be disastrous for the individuals concerned and their families  as well as for the future of higher education.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/664557618331029d522ae9dc5ba08449f37c7e03/0_0_3473_2084/master/3473.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e762da0ee9accaf70f3d6eea8005b2b5 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Imperial+College+London%2CHigher+education%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2CEducation https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who,world, US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO, Exclusive: objections leave health ministers unable to agree joint communique on cooperation, In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail  the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics. The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and China in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides. Donald Trump has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body’s China-centric approach  reflected – in his view – by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah  the health minister for Saudi Arabia  which was hosting the virtual summit  abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday  saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting. A six-paragraph statement made no mention of the WHO  but referred to systemic weaknesses in the way in which the world handled pandemics. However  an unpublished 52-paragraph draft communique supported and committed to further strengthening the WHO’s mandate in coordinating the fight against the pandemic  including the protection of frontline health workers and delivery of medical supplies  especially diagnostic tools  medicines and vaccines. The draft also expressed “concern about the continuity and lack of sustainable funding” of the WHO’s health emergencies programme. It urged all donors to invest in the fund  saying “it is far more cost effective to invest in sustainable financing for country preparedness than to pay to the costs of responding to outbreaks”. Several days before the meeting it had emerged that the US health and human services secretary  Alex Azar  would not be attending as scheduled. Other attendees said they understood that Trump did not want him to participate. Instead  the US was represented by Eric Hargan  Azar’s deputy  and another US official. Sherpas for other delegations were also made aware before the meeting of US objections to language relating to the WHO  which was supported by the 19 other countries. According to those present  many of the representatives at the meeting spoke of the key role being played by the WHO and praised the value of the guidance it has issued during the outbreak. Sources said that some representatives also made the point that any inquest into the handling of the pandemic by the WHO – as demanded by the Trump administration – should wait until after the pandemic was brought under control. When the US delegation’s turn came to speak  Hargan explained that the US “could not endorse” the declaration  instead suggesting that a summary be issued in the form of a press release. The bulk of the draft communique constituted a call for countries to cooperate multilaterally to prevent future pandemics  highlighting the current inequality in health resources and the human suffering the pandemic was causing. The draft contained no implicit or explicit criticism of China’s initial handling of the crisis  saying instead all sides were committed to learning lessons from the crisis  including the vulnerabilities exposed by the global response. Donald Trump last week suspended US payments to the WHO claiming the organisation was too “China-centric” and accused its leadership of failing to alert the world to the scale of the pandemic that began in Wuhan until it was too late. The WHO has insisted it acted as soon as it had information from Beijing and stated that it needed Chinese support to gain access to China  and investigate the issue of human-to-human transmission. David Nabarro  the WHO special envoy  warned on Monday that cutting funding in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic is “like removing the right hand of a surgeon when she is in the middle of a difficult operation.” The US has previously prevented the G7  a smaller group of mainly western industrialised countries  from reaching a joint position when foreign ministers were unable to agree with a US insistence that the virus be described as the “Wuhan virus”. Saudi Arabia is this year’s chair of the G20  and the main summit of world leaders is still scheduled to be held in Riyadh in November. In the run-up to that event specialist ministers meet to prepare parts of the final communique. The US is the second largest contributor to the WHO  and the sudden suspension of US payments for up to 90 days has infuriated other nations’ health ministries  while easing some of the pressure on China over its handling of the crisis. The Trump administration has been contacted for comment. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/195d6202ec0e000c2a833922a798e6b91fce8e24/0_37_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ce7f9874832db3979971e912343897d https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CG20%2CWorld+Health+Organization%2CWorld+news%2CHealth%2CInfectious+diseases%2CUS+news%2CDonald+Trump%2CSaudi+Arabia%2CChina https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/trump-plays-misleading-clips-of-support-from-cuomo-at-coronavirus-briefing,world, Trump plays misleading clips of 'support' from Cuomo at coronavirus briefing, US president accused of going into campaign mode after showing selectively edited videos containing praise by one of his most trenchant critics, The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo  whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic. “What the federal government did  working with states ... was a phenomenal accomplishment ” the governor said in the first clip. “These were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilisation  and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner  and I’m the first to say it. We needed help and they were there.” But the films were played just two days after Cuomo  who has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats during the crisis  eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. “First of all  if he’s sitting home watching TV  maybe he should get up and go to work  right ” he told reporters on Friday. “Second  let’s keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can because this is about the people and our job and let’s try to focus on that.” Cuomo acknowledged that Trump had moved quickly to increase hospital capacity  but said he was wrong to claim the city’s Javits Center  a convention facility converted to a hospital  had not been used  pointing out that 800 people had gone through. The projected number of patients “were the president’s projections”  he added. Exasperated  Cuomo went on: “The president doesn’t want to help on testing. I said 11 times  I said the one issue we need help with is testing. He said 11 times: ‘I don’t want to get involved in testing  it’s too complicated  it’s too hard.’ I know it’s too complicated and too hard. That’s why we need help. I can’t do an international supply chain. “He wants to say: ‘Well I did enough.’ Yeah  none of us have done enough. We haven’t  because it’s not over ... We have a lot more to do and no one can do the posture of ‘Just say thank you for what I’ve done  and I’m now out  I’m not doing anything else. I’ve done my part.’” The pair of New Yorkers exchanged barbs on Twitter but  at Sunday’s briefing  Trump was only eager to bask in Cuomo’s praise. After the first video was shown  he chided his staff: “They left out the good part. Good job  fellas ... You want to put the rest of it up  or do you not have it?” He added: “I just think it’s so good for people because it’s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats  Republicans. This is about a thing that hit our country  the likes of which has never happened to us before.” The second clip was duly played later in the briefing. And earlier Trump had read aloud from a Wall Street Journal column praising him. A CNN reporter asked  with more than 22 million Americans unemployed and the death toll now above 40 000  “is this really the time for self-congratulations?”. Trump retorted: “You’re CNN  you’re fake news ... You don’t have the brains you were born with.” Media reports suggest Trump is ready to transition from crisis mode to a new phase focused on economic recovery and his re-election. For his part  Cuomo issued two pointed tweets on Sunday evening. One said: “‘Everyone is entitled to his own opinion  but not his own facts.’ — Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.” The other thanked health care  hospital and nursing home workers  and said: “You are heroes. #NewYorkTough.” Trump’s publicity stunt also drew direct criticism. Walter Shaub  former director of the Office of Government Ethics  tweeted: “Beyond being another taxpayer-funded campaign ad  this video clip also makes Trump look exceedingly weak. The video casts Cuomo as Trump’s boss giving him a performance appraisal. (If only!).” The president also sought to downplay the national testing shortage  despite governors’ complaints that they lack sufficient capacity to safely reopen their economies. And he became visibly angry when questioned why he had still been holding campaign rallies in February rather than warning Americans about the virus. Challenged repeatedly by Weijia Jiang of CBS News  he demanded: “Who are you with? ... nice and easy  nice and easy  just relax ... Keep your voice down  please. Keep your voice down.” Touting his partial travel restrictions on China  he insisted: “You should say  ‘Thank you very much for good judgment.’” Away from the virus  Trump was questioned on whether he would consider pardoning allies Michael Flynn and Roger Stone  who were caught in the justice department’s Russia investigation. “The top of the FBI was scum ” he complained bitterly. “They’re human scum.” , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Coronavirus+outbreak%2CDonald+Trump%2CNew+York%2CAndrew+Cuomo%2CUS+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/russia-quarantines-thousand-of-soldiers-after-parade-rehearsals-coronavirus,world, Russia quarantines thousands of soldiers after parade rehearsals, Leaked video showed troops failing to practise physical distancing for coronavirus, The defence ministry said it would be sending the soldiers  estimated to number 15 000  back to their bases  where they would be put under a two-week quarantine. The ministry did not indicate that any of the soldiers had been infected with the coronavirus. The announcement came days after Vladimir Putin postponed celebrations for Victory Day on 9 May  a significant holiday in Russia usually marked by a military parade in Red Square and events where Russians pay respects to victims and veterans of the second world war. The Kremlin had been hesitant to postpone the 75th anniversary celebrations  which Putin had hoped to use to strengthen ties with foreign leaders  in particular the French president  Emmanuel Macron  who was expected to attend. Cases of coronavirus have been discovered in several Russian military units and academies. Last week  the defence ministry confirmed that dozens of cadets and instructors from the Nakhimov naval academy  which sends a delegation to march in the Victory Day parade  had been infected with coronavirus. The ministry said that none of those infected had taken part in the rehearsals. A leaked video earlier this month showed thousands of troops lined up at a parade ground outside of Moscow  prompting outrage and surprise  coming at the same time as the city and surrounding region instituted strict physical distancing guidelines. “How many people are there  15 000? Fuck  and they’ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask ” said one voice on the video  which was shot anonymously. The defence ministry then confirmed it had held a parade rehearsal on 1 April. No photos or videos have been released from the parade grounds since then  although the defence ministry insisted it was continuing preparations for the parade as normal. Full dress rehearsals for the parade had been scheduled for 29 April and 4 May. Asked whether the rehearsals violated physical distancing guidelines  Putin’s spokesman  Dmitri Peskov  told reporters that the military had “a totally different regime of isolation that of course allows them greater freedom of movement”. , https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Russia%2CSecond+world+war%2CVladimir+Putin%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CEurope%2CWorld+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/jair-bolsonaro-dictatorship-rally-protest-brazil-president-denounced,world, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro denounced for joining pro-dictatorship rally, Far-right president deemed ‘deplorable’ for flouting social distancing rules again – while coughing repeatedly – to bolster protests amid coronavirus, As the number of deaths caused by Covid-19 rose to nearly 2 500 on Sunday  Jair Bolsonaro left his presidential palace in Brazil’s capital  Brasília  to fraternize with flag-waving radicals. Among the demands their banners listed were an end to the social distancing measures opposed by Bolsonaro  the closure of Brazil’s congress and supreme court  and a re-run of a dictatorship-era decree used by military rulers in the late 1960s to suffocate their political opponents. At one point – snubbing social distancing rules for the umpteenth time since the coronavirus crisis began – Brazil’s paratrooper-turned-president clambered onto a truck to address the hundreds-strong assembly. “The era of roguery is over. Now it’s the people who are in power ” Bolsonaro proclaimed outside the Brazilian army headquarters  coughing repeatedly as he spoke. “Everyone in Brazil must understand that they must yield to the will of the Brazilian people.” Bolsonaro’s outing – which some suspect was a deliberate provocation designed to distract from the rising Covid-19 death toll – sparked immediate censure. Former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso  who governed from 1995 until 2003  tweeted: “Deplorable for the president to join anti-democratic protests. It’s time to unite around the constitution against all threats to democracy.” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  president from 2003 to 2010  tweeted: “The same constitution that allows a president to be democratically elected also contains devices to stop them leading the country to the destruction of democracy and a genocide of the population.” Rodrigo Maia  the head of Brazil’s lower house  said Brazil was in a dual fight against coronavirus “and the virus of authoritarianism”. “In total  2 462 deaths have been recorded in Brazil. Preaching a democratic rupture in the face of these deaths represents an unforgivable cruelty to the families of victims ” Maia tweeted. “We don’t have time to waste with coup-mongering bombast.” Eduardo Paes  Rio de Janeiro’s former mayor  tweeted: “There have always been morons going around ranting against democracy … Generally they’re minorities whose tickles you don’t even feel.” “[But it’s] something quite different when it’s the president – a democratically elected one – joining this kind of movement. There’s no way to remain quiet and not repudiate this ” Paes added. The O Globo broadsheet called Bolsonaro’s speech a “dangerous” assault on the democratic rule of law. Even members of the military top brass were reportedly upset  with one senior official urging citizens to ignore Bolsonaro’s actions. “Let the president talk to the nutters on his lonesome ” they told the news magazine Veja. On Monday morning Bolsonaro denied he had been attacking Brazilian democracy but told reporters: “I am actually the constitution”. Bolsonaro is a longstanding fan of the military men who ruled Brazil from 1964 until 1985  and autocrats including Chile’s Augusto Pinochet. Bolsonaro’s reaction to Covid-19 – which he has downplayed as media “hysteria” – has proved similarly controversial. Last week Bolsonaro sacked his popular health minister  Luiz Henrique Mandetta  who had clashed with him for undermining health ministry recommendations designed to protect Brazilian lives. Mandetta’s replacement Nelson Teich made no immediate comment on Bolsonaro’s decision to flout the same guidelines on Sunday. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/714b2cc154b2f33d7e6800bf034ae25feda75429/0_0_3523_2115/master/3523.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98bf73dcb3aea5743a4531231f82aff4 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3b3e684657776e36598e47f9199a2aaac313ea/409_445_3521_2114/master/3521.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad41af1e7eb3e2e73bc1cdc236f060bc https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Jair+Bolsonaro%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBrazil%2CRio+de+Janeiro%2CAmericas https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/lesotho-pm-thomas-thabane-stand-down-sides-agree-dignified-retirement,world, Lesotho PM to stand down after sides agree to ‘dignified retirement’, Government reaches deal with parties on Thomas Thabane’s immediate exit from office, Thomas Thabane  who has been accused of involvement in the murder of his ex-wife  will be allowed a “dignified retirement”  according to the deal negotiated by mediators from neighbouring South Africa. The 80-year-old leader appeared in court in February  where his lawyer argued that his office granted him immunity from prosecution for allegedly murdering his estranged first wife shortly before he took power. Lipolelo Thabane  58  was shot several times at close range as she sat in a car near her home  two days before her husband’s inauguration in 2017. She had reportedly refused a divorce and won a court battle to retain her privileges as first lady until any formal separation. Thabane remarried two months after her death. His current wife  Maesaiah  42  has been charged with murder after briefly fleeing the country. Both deny any wrongdoing. The case was brought back into the spotlight in January after a letter from Lesotho’s police chief emerged claiming communication records showed that someone at the murder scene had called Thabane’s mobile phone on the day of the crime. The killing was initially blamed on unknown criminals; Lesotho has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Investigators have since said they believe professional hitmen  possibly hired in South Africa  carried out the attack. Thabane had already pledged to step down at the end of July  but the South African mediator Jeff Radebe told journalists in Lesotho’s capital  Maseru  that “the timeline is immediate” for his leaving office The veteran politician made a final attempt to hold on to power at the weekend  sending soldiers and armoured vehicles on to the streets of Maseru on Saturday to restore order against “rogue national elements”. The move prompted authorities in South Africa  which surrounds Lesotho  to send envoys to the poor mountain kingdom of 2 million people. Thabane said he had deployed the army to deal with forces he said wanted to destabilise Lesotho. The country has experienced several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966. In 1998 at least 58 people and eight South African soldiers died and parts of Maseru were damaged during a political standoff and subsequent fighting. The latest upheaval follows Thabane’s decision last month to suspend parliament without consultation over the coronavirus pandemic. Lesotho has no confirmed cases of Covid-19  and the move was challenged in the constitutional court by coalition partners as well as some 20 rivals within his own party. The court ruled against the suspension on Friday  calling it “irrational”  paving the way for a threatened vote of no confidence against Thabane once parliament reconvenes. “He has nowhere to hide and has lost it. The electorate is against him  the judiciary and all other strategic institutions … meaning that the PM is finished ” Sofonea Shale  an independent political analyst  said on Sunday. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f58aa220481f1f373c3e4ada404462f51943d13/0_1337_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=183cf9ef6b44324451b0c942ecfdb72f https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5595c3c34bc477f8287f97b18347571ee22ded8/0_0_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f912f7d90a81493ecd7283cf4c737b77 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6cf7c27dc46521fa236ae8579d09d52c948f169/0_136_2473_1484/master/2473.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a000a7551c4156c7c8b1d7c708eb902 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882f14ba6da1ef3cc682c20b56817bc01c9c897b/1235_240_3186_1911/master/3186.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89f3761907be8050cfd80000df624f49 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882f14ba6da1ef3cc682c20b56817bc01c9c897b/1235_240_3186_1911/master/3186.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89f3761907be8050cfd80000df624f49 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Lesotho%2CSouth+Africa%2CWorld+news%2CAfrica https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/netanyahu-and-gantz-agree-to-form-unity-israeli-government,world, Netanyahu and Gantz agree to form unity Israeli government, Prime minister will remain in office for 18 months before handing position to his rival, A copy of the power-sharing agreement said Netanyahu  currently the interim leader  would remain in the role for 18 months before handing over to Gantz  a former army chief  for the remainder of a three-year term. The announcement was a stunning turnaround for Netanyahu  Israel’s longest-serving leader  who appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of three damning corruption indictments and mediocre election performance. He is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial and also gain significant influence over judicial appointments. Meanwhile  Gantz’s Blue and White will take half of all ministries  including defence and foreign affairs. The text also hinted at the potential annexation of parts of the Palestinian territories this summer  stating that Netanyahu could bring Donald Trump’s “vision for peace” to a government vote from 1 July. The US plan  pre-emptively rejected by Palestinian leaders  gives Israel full military control over Palestinians  much of their land and all of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements. Both Netanyahu and Gantz support Trump’s plan. Mohammad Shtayyeh  the Palestinian prime minister  warned that the formation of what he called “an Israeli annexation government” would dismantle the rights of the people of Palestine. Minutes after Monday’s power-sharing agreement was announced  Netanyahu tweeted a photo of the Israeli flag. Gantz said on Twitter that he had prevented a fourth round of elections  the likely outcome if no deal was reached. It could take several days to pass legislation needed to formalise the agreement before the new government can be inaugurated. Many had expected the stalemate to hold following three inconclusive elections that produced similar results and with little progress made between the two rivals during months of talks. Without a fully functioning government  Israel has been unable to pass a budget. Both politicians have been unable to forge majority coalitions on their own. Gantz was the latest to be tasked with forming a government after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy  but he failed to clinch a majority last week. Outbreaks of the coronavirus  which has put the country under lockdown  have added urgency to the need to break the deadlock. Last month  it was Gantz who appeared to back down on his longstanding demand that Netanyahu must leave power. The opposition leader went against his own party  Blue and White  and nominated himself as speaker of Israel’s parliament. Blue and White had planned to elect a different speaker  and push through legislation to end Netanyahu’s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment. But Gantz nominated himself with the support of Netanyahu and his allies  with the apparent aim of protecting the prime minister from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive. In uproar  Blue and White swiftly disintegrated  amid allegations Gantz had broke his one main promise since he began his short career in politics less than two years ago: to oust Netanyahu. Gantz said at the time that he was “at peace” with his decision. “This is the time for leaders to choose what is right and put the lingering issues and personal scores aside ” he said  adding he would not “drag Israel to elections at this time of emergency – which will be with us for a long time  and whose repercussions are going to be long-term.” Under the unity deal signed on Monday  the two politicians will head a specific “coronavirus cabinet” to deal with the pandemic. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65e9fd5c28c35eccb118eaeac3ab9a51c90f1147/0_231_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50538bc4b58181dda907a027487e88b5 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3622f478214d84af9f660a156e1eb418977bb33f/125_124_3524_2115/master/3524.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3c979c8174193e19d3072fde68c7ba0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941c3576c79a9927e56f3f3dea28feccf8142e47/0_111_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6f2360398189ffda13a70b8427fae3d https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ecc9a16871f258dd0267f47bed92b9be69b05b0/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9485459bb0f6965343c935ce8e56d13 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e07fd832d54a5a92bd23161f3d0334e22a1f73e/0_91_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdf955b44ac8416b0ca28c2b6685cab6 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Israel%2CMiddle+East+and+North+Africa%2CWorld+news%2CPalestinian+territories%2CBenjamin+Netanyahu https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nova-scotia-shooting-latest-death-toll-trudeau-response,world, Nova Scotia shooting death toll rises as Trudeau calls on Canadians to stand united, Death toll from country’s deadliest mass shooting rose to 19  including the gunman, “No one man’s action can build a wall between us and a better day  no matter how evil  how thoughtless or how destructive ” the prime minister said on Monday morning. “As families grieve the loss of a loved one  all Canadians are standing with them.” The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) revised the death toll of the weekend shooting upwards on Monday and said they anticipated finding more victims from the rampage  which lasted for at least 12 hours. “I know this is a challenging time for Nova Scotians and that there are so many unanswered questions. I want to reassure you that we are working hard to find out as much information as possible in the days and weeks to come ” said Chris Leather  the RCMP chief superintendent  adding that officers were currently examining 16 crime scenes. “We will be in this for months to come.” Police said Gabriel Wortman  a 51-year-old denturist  disguised himself as a police officer before his first attack in the coastal town of Portapique on Saturday evening. The victims included a teacher  nurse  police officer  social worker and three married couples. Wortman was shot dead by police following a standoff late Sunday morning. With Nova Scotia already in lockdown in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus  Trudeau acknowledged the grieving process would be especially difficult  announcing a virtual Facebook vigil on Friday at 7pm. “We are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic  save lives and to help each other make it to a better day ” he said. “But yesterday we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy.” The chaos began late Saturday evening  when police responded to emergency calls in Portapique. Residents told local media that Wortman set fire to numerous properties – including his own – and shot people fleeing for safety. Officers found “several casualties” inside and outside at a house in Portapique at 11.30pm  but couldn’t locate a suspect. On Monday  police said they anticipated finding additional victims in the remains of buildings that were burned down. Authorities haven’t yet determined a motivation for the attacks  but the fact that Wortman had created a replica RCM vehicle and “either a real uniform or a perfect facsimile” suggested his early actions were deliberate  said Leather. “His ability to move around the province undetected was surely greatly benefited by the fact that he had a vehicle that looked identical in every way to a marked police car ” Leather said. One resident told the Globe and Mail that Wortman arrived at his house Sunday morning  dressed as a police officer and driving what appeared to be a police car. Brandishing a pistol and rifle  Wortman began pounding on the door. “He came here to kill me ” the man told the Globe and Mail. “There’s no question about that.” The man and his wife hid until Wortman left. “He wasn’t killing enemies  he was killing his friends ” he said. “He was trying to beat down our door. It was beyond terrifying.” Wortman eventually swapped his police cruiser replica for a silver SUV on Sunday  leading police in a chase down a busy highway  culminating in a fatal shootout at a gas station in the town of Enfield. On Monday  police faced questions over why they didn’t send out text alerts to warn residents of an active shooter in the region  instead relying on Twitter to keep the public updated. Many rural communities in the province lack access to high-speed internet. Police said the victims included a police officer who was shot after responding to reports of the shooting on Sunday morning. Constable Heidi Stevenson  a mother of two  had served on the force for 23 years. “We have lost one of our own while she was protecting others ” said Leather. “This is the definition of a true hero.” As news of the shootings spread  family members and friends eulogized the victims on social media. Among the dead was Tom Bagley  who was killed as he rushed to help victims. “This beautiful soul was taken from me so unnecessarily. I can’t even comprehend it ” his daughter Charlene wrote on Facebook. Heather O’Brien  a nurse and grandmother from the town Truro in central Nova Scotia  was remembered for her kind spirit. “The pain comes and goes in waves. I feel like I’m outside of my own body ” wrote her daughter Darcy Dobson  who described texting her mother minutes before she died – and the “monster” that killed her. “I want everyone to remember how kind she was … Let those things define her. Not the horrible way she died.” O’Brien’s niece Megan Brown remembered her aunt as a “healer” and a “bright light”. Greg and Jamie Blair  a husband and wife  were also among those killed. “I have absolutely no words for the heartache my family & many others are going through ” wrote Jessica MacBurnie on Facebook. The couple  married in 2014  leave behind their two children. Lisa McCully  a teacher and mother of two  was also killed during the rampage  according to her sister and the Nova Scotia teacher’s union. “She was somebody who taught from the heart ” said the union president  Paul Wozney. “She taught her kids not just the curriculum but teaching about virtues and personal qualities.” On the Nova Scotia Kitchen Party Facebook group – originally created for residents to connect and sing together during the coronavirus pandemic – members posted tributes to the victims and sang songs  including Amazing Grace. The massacre in Nova Scotia is the worst of its kind in Canadian history  eclipsing the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre  in which 14 women were killed in Montreal. A man driving a van deliberately ran over and killed 10 people in Toronto in April 2018 and a man shot dead six people at an Islamic cultural centre in Quebec City in 2017. In his remarks on Monday  Trudeau also addressed children living in Nova Scotia. “I know the world can seem like a mean and ugly place right now  but there’s a whole lot of good in the world too. You’ll see it in your neighbours and in Canadians in the days and months ahead ” he said. “This is a difficult time and it can be a scary time too. But we’re here for you and we’re going to get through this together  I promise.” • This article was amended on 21 April 2020. The number of women killed in 1989 at the École Polytechnique was 14  not 15 as an earlier version said. This has been corrected. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1aa54fe461b11deab205c03ca00c2b6519285ee/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ea0040e5c6e72a432b7d61c05c2f8b0 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15fdd8a762e7186e161cc42979172ca1e53100ef/375_0_2250_2811/master/2250.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba2cac0c73db3de84c9824dc960d6100 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Canada%2CGun+crime%2CJustin+Trudeau%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CNova+Scotia+shooting https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/kim-yo-jong-the-sister-of-kim-jong-un-fast-becoming-his-alter-ego,world, Kim Yo-jong: the sister of Kim Jong-un  fast 'becoming his alter ego', The North Korean leader’s trusted propagandist-in-chief is in the ascendancy, Since representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang  South Korea  Yo-jong has not only acquired prestigious titles within the ruling Workers’ party. She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim’s carefully constructed public image  at home and abroad. In return  she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother  a leader capable of ordering the execution of his own uncle for alleged treason. As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic – with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case – Kim Yo-jong’s ascendancy continues. Last month  she made her first public statement  condemning the South as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. And in March  she publicly praised Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The publication of political statements in Kim Yo-jong’s name underlines her central role in the regime  according to Youngshik Bong  a research fellow at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone ” Bong said. “He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.” But Yo-jong  who accompanied Kim to his two summits with Trump  apparently paid a price when his nuclear diplomacy suffered a setback. Last weekend  she was reinstated to the party’s powerful politburo  according to the state Korean Central News Agency  just over a year after she had reportedly been removed from the position and told to keep a low profile following the failure of the Hanoi denuclearisation summit. And she has not escaped the attention of US officials  who in 2017 placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for “severe human rights abuses”. Internationally  Yo-jong has been a visible presence throughout the regime’s high-stakes diplomatic process with Washington and Seoul. At home  she has performed the role of propagandist-in-chief  burnishing Kim’s reputation as head of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations. “She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un ” said Leonid Petrov  a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney. “She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship  but knows all about them. She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.” Yo-jong  who is thought to be four years younger than her brother  was rarely seen in public until 2010  when she was photographed attending a party conference. By the following year  she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage  and was seen mourning after his death in late 2011. But her journey to the heart of the North Korean regime had arguably begun in the late 1990s  when she attended primary school in Berne  Switzerland at the same time as Kim Jong-un  with whom she lived in a private home  attended to by staff and watched over by bodyguards  according to North Korea Leadership Watch. “They were virtually in exile together  both knowing what the future had in store for them ” Bong said. “They must have gained a tremendous sense of having a common fate. As a result  she has her brother’s unconditional trust.” Little is known about Yo-jong’s life during the period between her graduation with a computer science degree from Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang and 2007  when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party. She is said to have been involved in arranging her brother’s succession as supreme leader after Kim Jong-il suffered two strokes in 2008  but was not mentioned by North Korean state media until March 2014  when she accompanied her brother during elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly. “The North Korean regime is a family business  and Kim Jong-un appears to place trust in his sister ” said Leif-Eric Easley  associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. “She has demonstrated skills at modernising the brand of the regime  and has some sway over state propaganda. Her most important function is probably as a confidante to her brother. “But she also has a signalling role because messages from Kim Yo-jong carry more weight than those of an imminently replaceable North Korean official.” Kim Yo-jong’s upward trajectory is expected to continue once the North resumes its nuclear diplomacy in a post-pandemic world. “She plays a pivotal role in North Korean domestic and foreign policy campaigns because she is one of the main stakeholders in the regime’s survival ” Petrov said. But  he added  she would never adopt the mantle of leader should something happen to her brother. “Kim Yo-jong knows how to smooth Kim Jong-un’s initiatives and strengthen his soft power … but she won’t replace the primary decision-maker. North Korea is a Confucian country where seniority and masculinity are respected. She is Kim’s most trusted ally  but no more than that.” , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/12/28/Justin_McCurry,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04d05d2e2ebf2c9d7a58bd145555a76c https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbc8b6e6049d420c7bce1f344ea012fca586546/304_5_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8c8b4a71e865012cacfe518b4c7f5994 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beaaf2b29a06bb1a6f393e246c996d013a20ec07/0_58_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b003be3ed19cda13651a40dcbbb5b7a https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857b36e24d7981e36d969cb6ff32e0809c2a639a/0_35_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a69b1dafd72d9547ce517831453bbb5 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=North+Korea%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news%2CKim+Jong-un%2CSouth+Korea https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-lockdown-boosts-numbers-of-thailands-rare-sea-turtles,environment, Coronavirus lockdown boosts numbers of Thailand's rare sea turtles, Largest number of nests of leatherbacks found in two decades as beaches emptied, From wild boars strolling through the Israeli city of Haifa to deer venturing into London suburbs  lockdowns are drawing wildlife into many emptied areas. In Thailand  with 2 792 infections and 47 deaths as of Monday morning  travel curbs ranging from a ban on international flights to an appeal to citizens to stay at home have resulted in a collapse in tourist numbers  and freed up the beaches for wildlife. The 11 turtle nests authorities have found since last November were the highest number in 20 years  said Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong  the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Centre. “This is a very good sign for us because many areas for spawning have been destroyed by humans ” he said. No such nests had been found for the previous five years. “If we compare to the year before  we didn’t have this many spawn  because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.” Leatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand  and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas  scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been known to dig into their nests and steal eggs. Late in March  staff at a national park in the southern province of Phang Nga  bordering the Andaman Sea  found 84 hatchlings after monitoring eggs for two months. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005433c9bd1aba02174db83851adf5c918f86539/0_156_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=128c8dc75688d9c9c6a26fced1000f22 https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Wildlife%2CThailand%2CConservation%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CWorld+news%2CAsia+Pacific%2CEnvironment https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/uk-youth-employment-prospects-crumbling-in-coronavirus-crisis,business, 'UK youth employment prospects crumbling' in coronavirus crisis, Employers warn of grim summer for graduates as firms  big and small  trim recruitment, Lloyds Banking Group  HSBC and the accountants PwC and BDO are among the large companies that have been forced to make changes to their recruitment plans because of the crisis. Many of the largest graduate employers are services firms whose employees must work from home under the government’s lockdown guidelines  making welcoming new trainees difficult. At the same time  many big employers have already reported a steep fall in work as the lockdown recession bites  meaning training new workers has fallen down the list of priorities. “Youth employment prospects are crumbling ” said Gerwyn Davies  senior labour market adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. “We are already seeing evidence that recruitment has fallen sharply  which is not surprising given that the government’s focus is on preserving [existing] jobs.” More than a quarter of companies said they anticipated hiring fewer graduates because of the pandemic  according to a survey last month by the Institute of Student Employers. Non-graduate recruitment was also expected to be negatively affected for 23% of employers. Economists have found a persistent “scarring” effect on the careers of people who enter the labour market during a crisis  with wages still lower on average as long as five years after starting work. Paul Johnson  the Institute for Fiscal Studies director  said: “Previous experience suggests that university graduates will start off in lower paying jobs than otherwise and will suffer ‘scarring’ effects such that they will be more likely to be unemployed several years after graduating. It will take several years before their earnings catch up with what they otherwise would have been.” The effect on formal hiring schemes differs from company to company  with many opting to induct new recruits digitally. Lloyds and Santander both cancelled their summer internship schemes  although all those already accepted will progress to the final stage of the banks’ 2021 graduate recruitment process. HSBC is understood to have delayed the start dates for all UK graduate recruits and interns  while the US investment bank Goldman Sachs has pushed back start dates for two rounds of internships. BT  which in early February announced plans to hire about 300 graduates this year  has removed any grade criteria associated with graduate roles  amid widespread difficulties for university exams  as long as the applicant completes their studies. The company said it was confident it could drop the requirement for a 2:1 degree as it had a rigorous recruitment process. BDO  the UK’s fifth-largest accounting firm  has paused the recruitment of new trainees and cancelled its summer internships. BDO has also furloughed first-year trainees and apprentices among 700 staff who will see 80% of their wages paid by the government. Deloitte  EY  KPMG and PwC – the so-called big four accounting firms which are also major graduate recruiters – have not disclosed any changes to their graduate recruitment schemes  despite cutting pay for their partners by between 20% and 25%. However  PwC has cancelled its summer internship for 400 undergraduates. Those students have been offered alternatives which could include automatic entry on to the firm’s graduate programme in 2021. PwC’s new recruits will be trained online  and the summer work experience programme will be offered digitally to all 5 500 students who originally applied for the 600 places. There are also concerns that the decline in hiring for roles that require less training will also hit young people harder  given their widespread employment in sectors such as restaurants  retail and support services. Smaller companies are also much less likely to hire inexperienced workers  given the short-term cost. “It will affect all sectors and all skill levels ” Davies said. “This looks set to be a fairly grim summer for those who haven’t yet found jobs.” In contrast to the government’s unprecedented job retention scheme  there is little in the way of extra support for jobless people of any age during the coronavirus outbreak  other than unemployment support paid out under universal credit. , https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656959d49b1272d694527dd62834b00219cfe484/0_0_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f779a482b7ca472cde9ad367b2b2c972 https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cac4185be6f8dc887cd4783316a42b0af6f1e0a/11_0_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03ead9a2ce52e9011bc6bd6cb0ab36dc https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1696d2cc217c30fac16630b1947ee6b721f19a57/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c698eb7d785a8cd4b22ee5985361fe https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e56b64d42f9fc84ae7b070ebf51b221129a201/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=568e398e8f8308810fbc54c4e7937410 https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/12/27/Richard_Partington,_R.png https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Job+losses%2CGraduate+careers%2CBanking%2CAccountancy%2CCoronavirus+outbreak%2CBusiness%2CFinancial+sector%2CMoney%2CWork+%26+careers%2CUK+news https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif 
20/4/2020,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/20/fears-of-flood-as-uks-covid-19-furlough-scheme-opens,money, 140 000 UK companies apply for coronavirus job furlough scheme, Fears that system would be overwhelmed seem unfounded as launch goes smoothly, It is understood the price tag attached to the requests is about £1bn  a figure that is likely to rise significantly as more companies make their applications for help over the coming days and weeks. Rishi Sunak said the government had delivered on its promise to pay wages for threatened jobs  under a programme that allows employers to lay off staff temporarily and claim up to 80% of their salaries from the state  up to a maximum of £2 500 a month. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference  he said: “Exactly a month ago today I stood at this lectern and said we would help to pay people’s wages. We promised support would be available by the end of April. Today  we deliver our promise.” Expressing hope that the economy could still quickly recover from the coronavirus outbreak  Sunak said the first million people being furloughed were at risk of losing their jobs without the government’s support. The chancellor said getting the coronavirus job retention scheme system (CJRS) up and running was a “remarkable story of public service” as thousands of HMRC staff had either worked overtime or come out of retirement to help. The system is able to process up to 450 000 applications an hour  while it will take companies up to six days to receive funds. HMRC has deployed 9 500 staff to deal with queries. Fears that the website could crash and that phone lines would be overwhelmed looked to be unfounded  as business groups said the scheme had got off to a smooth start. However  business leaders warned there was no room for error  as many employers would need to run their payrolls this week. The government has also been criticised over the rollout of its coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS)  which is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses. Sunak said on Monday that the number of loans offered under the scheme had risen to 12 000 from 6 000 last week. A spokesman for the business lobby group the Institute of Directors said: “Another acid test will be the money reaching firms’ accounts.” Against the backdrop of a potentially prolonged government lockdown  after ministers opted to keep tough restrictions on social and business activity in place for at least another three weeks  the job retention scheme has been extended until the end of June. As many as 8 million workers could be furloughed in total  according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation thinktank  which warned low-paid hospitality and retail companies would be affected most. It said the cost of the scheme after the first day alone would be £4.2bn over three months  although that figure is expected to rise sharply. The Office for Budget Responsibility  the government’s independent economic forecaster  had put the cost of the scheme at £42bn before the extension was announced. Employers can only claim for furloughed employees who were on their payroll on or before 19 March  and there are fears that many people will fall t
