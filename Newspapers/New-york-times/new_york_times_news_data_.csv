By Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Jesse McKinley With the number of new deaths and rate of hospitalizations falling in New York  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that “the worst is over” in the coronavirus pandemic  and he announced an alliance with six other Northeastern governors to explore how to eventually lift restrictions — a move that appeared to be an implicit rebuke to President Trump. The governors from New Jersey  Connecticut  Pennsylvania  Delaware  Massachusetts and Rhode Island said they would begin to draw up a plan for when to reopen businesses and schools  and how quickly to allow people to return to work safely  although the timeline for such a plan remained unclear. “If you do it wrong  it can backfire  and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe ” Mr. Cuomo said. “What the art form is going to be here is doing that smartly and doing that in a coordinated way.” The joint effort was the first of two announced on Monday: The governors of California  Oregon and Washington  three Western states that were among those that felt the impact of the virus before it spread rapidly in the Northeast  announced a similar pact. All but one of the 10 governors on the two coasts are Democrats. In moving ahead on their own  the governors were all but disregarding President Trump just as he was trying to assert control over the question of when and how to reopen the country — a move that set up the possibility of a collision course between the states and Washington. The president spent Monday assembling a task force to advise him on a path to restoring some semblance of normal life in America. He rejected the notion that the decision would be left to the governors  even though they have been the ones to close the schools and issue the stay-at-home orders  not the federal government. “For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion  some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states  not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government ” he wrote on Twitter. “Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect. It is the decision of the President  and for many good reasons.” Hours after his tweet  and after the governors’ announcements  Mr. Trump doubled down on his claim that his executive powers superseded that of states. “When somebody is the president of the United States  the authority is total ” he said at his evening briefing at the White House. Moments after that  Vice President Mike Pence modulated the president’s sentiment somewhat  saying the administration would issue guidelines for the states to follow on reopening the economy. “We’ll work with those states and in some cases it’ll make sense for them to work on a regional basis ” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump offered no legal or constitutional basis to back up his claim to exclusive authority to reopen society. And soon after  Governor Cuomo called in to CNN and said: “You don’t become king because of a national emergency.” The federal government issued guidelines last month recommending that Americans refrain from gatherings of over 10 people and take other measures  but the binding orders to close were issued by the governors and mayors. It also remained unclear how Mr. Trump could overrule a governor who wanted to keep businesses and schools closed even after the president wanted them to reopen. In staking out his authority  Mr. Trump seemed to be contradicting his previous position that handling the coronavirus outbreak was essentially a local problem. The president had resisted enacting a national stay-at-home lockdown  leaving it to each state to decide on its own; the president also has said that it was a state’s job to properly manage its hospital beds and ventilators. The focus on reopening the economy came even as the death toll in New York State surpassed 10 000 people  but other indicators continued to plateau or decline slightly  leading Mr. Cuomo to declare that the worst of the outbreak may have passed. Nearly 19 000 people remain hospitalized in New York  the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States  but the rate of hospitalizations has slowed markedly over the last week  and the 671 deaths announced on Monday marked the lowest one-day death toll in a week. But even with the numbers plateauing  Mr. Cuomo said  the situation could worsen if New Yorkers ignored social distancing measures. “I believe the worst is over if we continue to be smart ” Mr. Cuomo  a Democrat  said during his daily briefing in Albany. “I believe we can start on the path to normalcy.” With millions of people filing for unemployment benefits and tax revenues drying up  the governors from the seven Northeastern states said the objective was to gradually increase economic activity and the number of employees considered essential workers  while tracking closely the virus’s infection rate. They added that they needed to act in concert to prevent people from crossing state borders to shop or do business in states with looser restrictions. The seven states together have recorded over 325 000 confirmed virus cases and more than 14 400 deaths  around 63 percent of the country’s total. The governors of those states sought to cast their action both as a sign of hope and as a recognition that they had to act on their own. “Seeing as how we had the responsibility for closing the state down  I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up ” said Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania. ”We’re simply saying it’s our responsibility to steer our way through these uncharted waters. And it’s our responsibility to figure out a way back.” Mr. Cuomo also seemed confused by the president’s assertion that only he could open the economy. “If it is your authority to open  why wasn’t it your authority to close?” he asked. The action on the East Coast came as Washington  Oregon and California — the nation’s most populous state — also announced “a shared vision for reopening their economies ” amid the outbreak  which has been less catastrophic thus far in that region. Like the plan in the Northeast  there was little detail on the timing or scope of such an economic restart  but the states said they would prioritize the health of particularly vulnerable populations  like seniors. “We need to see a decline in the rate of spread of the virus before large-scale reopening ” read a joint statement from the three states’ governors. Mr. Cuomo has said a successful approach to reopening the economy would hinge on the ability to ramp up testing for antibodies to identify people who are immune to the virus and could safely return to work. New York business leaders were cautiously encouraged by the action taken by Mr. Cuomo and other governors  noting that the state’s economy had been battered in recent weeks after a decade-long run that had seen low unemployment and strong consistent growth. “There’s no doubt there’s going to be economic harm  there already has been ” said Heather C. Briccetti  the president of the Business Council of New York State. “The question is how do we thoughtfully exit the shutdown and how do you take steps to reopen so that you don’t prolong the harm.” Small business owners warily rejoiced at the prospect of reopening at some point. Michael Mirzayev  22  who co-owns the Coney Island Pet Grooming in Brooklyn  said that he was hopeful that businesses could reopen by May or soon thereafter  but not if it meant the virus could see a resurgence. “We have been hearing that Cuomo is planning to reopen  and we hope it’s true ” said Mr. Mirzayev  who runs the pet salon with his mother. “We have to get back to work and stuff to pay for just like everyone else.” Mr. Cuomo has reiterated that measures to reopen schools and loosen restrictions on businesses and transit systems should be coordinated with regional and county governments in the New York City metropolitan area  in order to avoid another surge in the number of cases. “This virus doesn’t understand school district boundaries  and these systems we’re talking about don’t work on any of these boundaries ” he said. “Schools  transportation  jobs; they don’t work on a county basis.” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that New York City would keep track of three indicators to determine when the city might reopen: the number of people admitted to hospitals  the number of patients under intensive care and the percentage of people testing positive. “We’ve got to see them all move down in unison over a prolonged period of time to be able to get to that next phase where we have low-level transmission and then we can start on the path to a more normal life ” Mr. de Blasio said. Mr. Cuomo’s tentative steps toward a reopening of the economy came a little more than three weeks after an executive order took effect  closing down all nonessential businesses and hitting the brakes on the state economy. Asked whether suggesting that the worst had passed could encourage people to disregard warnings about social distancing and other containment efforts  Mr. Cuomo pushed back. “That’s why I’ve said the exact opposite 57 times ” Mr. Cuomo said. “Stay the course  stay the course  it’s working  stay the course  stay inside  take precautions. That’s why I say that 100 times.” At the same time  Mr. Cuomo said that he wanted the public to believe in the data  which has shown a decrease in deaths over the last two days. The highest number of daily deaths was reached on April 8  when 799 people were reported to have died. Indeed  doctors in some hospitals in New York City and its surrounding areas said the volume of coronavirus patients coming into their emergency rooms has continued to decline. The number of patients with the coronavirus at hospitals operated by Northwell  the state’s largest health care provider  declined to 3 267 on Monday morning from a high of 3 425 people last Tuesday  according to a spokesman. Still  other health care professionals  like Michael Pappas  a resident in family medicine in New York City  cautioned against reopening the economy too soon without adequate testing capabilities and safety protocols in place. “Coming back to work prematurely in these conditions  means that CEOs will stay in their mansions while putting the most vulnerable sectors at risk ” he said. “These government politicians and corporate executives are betting with our lives.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker  Jeffery C. Mays  Matthew Haag  Brian M. Rosenthal and Michael Rothfeld. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/nyregion/13nyvirus-ledeall1/13nyvirus-ledeall1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/22/multimedia/author-luis-ferre-sadurni/author-luis-ferre-sadurni-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-jesse-mckinley/author-jesse-mckinley-thumbLarge.jpg

From the nose of a patient on a mile-long line to a phone call days later  bottlenecks thwart its progress., Supported by The backlog for Covid-19 testing in New Jersey and other parts of the country is getting worse  not better. From the nose of a patient on a mile-long line to a phone call days later  bottlenecks thwart its progress. By Rukmini Callimachi PARAMUS  N.J. — The lines start forming the night before  as people with glassy eyes and violent coughs try to get tested for the virus. In the darkness  they park their cars  cut their engines and try to sleep. The backlog for coronavirus testing in New Jersey  the state with the second-highest caseload in the country  has been getting worse  not better  officials say. So far  New Jersey has conducted over 115 000 tests  about one for every 75 residents. Across the river in New York  the epicenter of the crisis  there is about one for every 40. The tests are a critical tool in measuring the disease’s spread and a requirement for certain forms of treatment. Yet they remain hard to get  and many are actively discouraged from trying. “It’s unequivocally worsening ” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said recently  adding  “We’ve got constraints in the entire food chain.” Initially  the strain came from a lack of test kits  but now there are not enough nasal swabs  not enough nurses. There is a pileup at the labs themselves and a limited supply of the chemicals needed to identify the virus. Two weeks ago at the Bergen Community College in Paramus  a drive-through testing site in the hardest-hit area of New Jersey  residents had to arrive by 3 a.m. to get a spot. Within days  they were told to show up at 11 p.m. the night before. On Monday of last week  Anita Holmes-Perez felt so sick that she asked her husband to drive her there even earlier  at 10:45  but a car was already ahead of her. The entrance to the site  run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  was blocked off by an armored personnel carrier. Members of the National Guard idled in camouflage nearby. Ms. Holmes-Perez spent the night constantly adjusting the reclining seat inside her Mercedes S-Class  lying down until the congestion in her chest forced her to sit up again. She was battling a fever  a cough  dizziness and a feeling of confusion. “Like you don’t know where you are ” the 45-year-old said. “You forget what you’re doing.” When medical workers finally took a sample from her the next morning  it would be shipped across the country because the local lab was too full. Three vans would take it part of the way. A plane  sent on a detour by a storm  would take it further. It would be days before she got a result. Until then  Ms. Holmes-Perez waited. Shortly before the drive-through opened at 8 a.m. last Tuesday  a police car drove up and down the mile-long line of parked vehicles  sirens blaring. “I think they did it to wake us up ” said 29-year-old Kayla Codina  who had spent the hours before dawn swiping through TikTok  too anxious to sleep inside her Ford Fusion. When testing finally began  the cars surged forward  approaching a triage site marked in orange cones. From a distance  the station appeared to be manned by astronauts. The nurses were wearing face shields and bright white scrubs  their first names written in black marker on the front along with the digits 0800: the hour they got suited up. A grid of temperatures and times advised how long before they would need to discard the uniforms. “Please roll up your window ” one of the nurses said. “Higher  please.” The people coming to get tested are not allowed out of their cars  and their windows can be open no more than an inch — just enough for workers to slip in a pink square of paper with a number on it. They give out only 500 numbers a day. Before patients can get one  they are asked to hold their New Jersey drivers’ licenses against the glass to prove they are residents. On previous days  desperate people drove in from out of state. Those with no symptoms are also turned away. When the medical staff asked Ms. Codina to describe how she was feeling  she said she could no longer take a full breath. She was handed Square No. 14  allowing her to drive a few dozen feet up to a white tent. Farther down the line  Andres Chia  54  who had tested positive days earlier  was worried that he had infected his younger brother and their 84-year-old father. The nurse handed them Nos. 145 and 146 and waved their Nissan forward. “My father keeps asking: ‘Is it my time now? Is this how I am going to go?’” said the younger brother  Israel Chia  44. A nurse leaned in with a long Q-tip but was corrected by her manager. “Tell him to face forward ” he said to her. When she inserted the swab into the older man’s nose  pushing as far back as it could go  he erupted into an explosive cough  the kind that aerosolizes the virus  sending tiny  potentially dangerous droplets into the air  most of them trapped inside the Nissan. By midafternoon  they’d run out of tests. Workers placed the day’s work — hundreds of test tubes in plastic bags — into two large boxes covered in ice packs. Douglas Ortmann  a 20-year FedEx veteran  eased the two boxes into his empty van. Since screening began weeks ago  he has waited for the phone call each day  dashed to the Paramus testing site and then driven the samples to Teterboro  14 minutes away. “I understand how important it is ” he said. At 2:55 p.m.  the van pulled into the loading dock of Quest Diagnostics’ flagship lab. As tests were underway in the drive-through  their destination was being decided 900 miles across the country. In Brookfield  Wis.  Quest’s executive vice president James E. Davis was working from home  like much of the country. The floor-to-ceiling windows of his home office face a verdant lawn  but his eyes were trained on his desktop monitor  where he had loaded a spreadsheet of how many nasal swabs each of his labs had received. This much was obvious: The Teterboro lab  one of the company’s largest  was overwhelmed. Over the preceding 24 hours  FedEx drivers like Mr. Ortmann had arrived with samples from elsewhere in New Jersey — including hospitals  whose patients take priority over those at drive-throughs — and from New York. While other countries quickly ramped up screening  the United States lost valuable time. It wasn’t until late February that private labs were given the go-ahead to create tests of their own. Quest began with a test in a single lab in California  and has since expanded screening to 12 locations. It can process 35 000 specimens a day  though not at the same facility. A fleet of 23 planes ferry coolers of nasal swabs to one lab or another. New Jersey’s state-operated lab runs no more than 70 tests a day  according to Christopher Neuwirth  an assistant commissioner at the state’s Health Department. Some hospitals can do on-site tests  but they’re a drop in the bucket. So the burden has fallen on private labs like Quest  whose workload comes from all over the nation. Mr. Neuwirth said that was hurting New Jersey right now  because it sits within driving distance of New York. “We happen to be in a region with all these hot spots  and when you have commercial labs doing this across the country  every state competes to get their tests done ” he said. At Quest  Mr. Davis jumps on a conference call twice a day to decide which labs have wiggle room and which don’t. For much of last week  the Teterboro lab was at capacity  with almost half its caseload from high-priority hospital patients. Before the FedEx van pulled up to the 250 000-square-foot lab in New Jersey  Mr. Davis’s decision was already made: The test tubes would be diverted to a lab in Chantilly  Va. Workers brought them inside to prepare them for the next leg of the journey. Two women in lab coats created a manifest  logging each patient’s information into a computer. The specimens were moved to six coolers the color of key lime pie and packed with dry ice. At 1:24 a.m. on Wednesday  another van drove them to the airport across the street  where a small single-engine plane was waiting. The pilot  George Fendley  would be flying solo  as he did several times a week. If there ever were passenger seats inside the plane  they’d been ripped out  the coolers filling the belly of the aircraft. It was less than an hour to Virginia  about 270 miles away  and the plane took off at 1:53 a.m. Along the way  Mr. Fendley flew into a thunderstorm and had to touch down in Pennsylvania. He took off again  trying to skirt around the lashing winds and rain. When he landed  it was 4:28 a.m. Another van drove the cargo 27 minutes to Chantilly. Soon the sun was rising  and as the operators unpacked the samples  almost 24 hours had elapsed. At the drive-through  New Jersey residents had been told to expect a three- to five-day wait. “Do you know if they mean business days or regular days?” Ms. Codina later asked. In an effort to alleviate the strain on the system  some doctors have advised patients to avoid testing. That was the case for Ms. Holmes-Perez  who received the following message from her doctor’s office: “There is no benefit to being tested as you probably would not qualify anyway. Just stay on your medications.” But with each passing day  her symptoms worsened. She struggled to breathe. Then she started to slur her speech. Next she began to feel confused. “I would enter a room and forget where I was ” she recalled. For many  the concern is not just their own health but that of loved ones. Ms. Codina said she was waiting to find out her status so she could decide where to live until she got better: Her roommate had been experiencing Covid-like symptoms. If Ms. Codina’s test came back negative  she planned to move in with either her boyfriend or her parents. “This impacts many  many people in my life ” she said And in their shared home in Hackensack  N.J.  the Chia brothers were self-quarantining  each in his own bedroom. They wanted to know which members of their family were positive so they could protect their father. In Chantilly  the machine used to analyze the samples  known as the Roche Cobas 8800  can run 376 tests at once. It takes between three and four hours for the machine to do one cycle. In theory  it can perform 500 tests in under eight hours. But before anything can happen  a human being needs to do the painstaking work of loading each sample into the machine. As the sun rose on Wednesday morning  a scientist used a pipette to remove liquid from each tube and place it in the testing apparatus. The machine gave off a purple hue. In the hours that followed  its mechanized arms and levers carried out a process known as the polymerase chain reaction to replicate genetic material. The lab was trying to match the samples against a sequence unique to the new coronavirus  according to Dr. Lawrence Tsao  Quest’s East Region medical director. The process requires high heat and a number of chemical reagents. One of those  an enzyme called Taq polymerase  was originally sourced from bacteria deep in the ocean’s hydrothermal vents. Because it is in short supply  there is a cap on how many tests Quest can do per day. “Usually we have extra reagents on hand ” Dr. Tsao said. “Now they calculate what we’re doing  and they give us just that.” The last step is delivering the results. Twelve times a day  Quest sends batches of results to Maximus  a federal contractor. Because of privacy concerns  the Reston  Va.-based company’s call center does not leave voice messages. Its operators call back only twice before moving to the next patient. By the time they called Ms. Holmes-Perez  three days had passed since she spent all night waiting in line. By then  the congestion was so bad she had a hard time hearing the operator. “Negative ” the caller told her. “At first  I felt relief  but then I started to worry about what is actually going on with me ” Ms. Holmes-Perez said. In North Bergen  Ms. Codina feared she might not hear the call  so she bought herself a new ringtone: a Ricky Martin song. On Friday  her phone started blasting “Livin’ La Vida Loca” just as she had started to make herself a sandwich. She left the door to the refrigerator open in her haste to answer. Like a little over half the people who have been tested in the state  she  too  was told she was negative. But when the operator called Israel Chia in Hackensack on Friday  it was with bad news: Both he and his elderly father were positive. Over the weekend  the situation got worse. The oxygen monitor he had bought put his father in the range of 85 to 90 percent. Doctors are concerned if a patient’s reading falls below 95. On Saturday  he called 911. Paramedics confirmed the low oxygen level but had a warning for the son: Once your father goes to the hospital  you won’t be able to see him. And he will be surrounded by extremely sick people  who may have a worse strain of the virus. The test had brought one level of clarity  but now the brothers were facing another dilemma. “Here at home  I can give him his vitamins  his Pedialyte  his protein shake. He’s comfortable ” Mr. Chia said. “Should I keep him home? For now  that’s what we’ve decided to do.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

But there’s no staying at home when you do not have one. Christian Cascone spends most days in a storage space he rents because of a risk of infection at the Bronx homeless shelter where he spends his nights.Credit...Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times Supported by By Nikita Stewart Roy Coleman  a 69-year-old living in a homeless shelter on Wards Island  was taken away by ambulance after showing symptoms of Covid-19. The other shelter residents were relieved — until Mr. Coleman was allowed to return last week after testing positive at Harlem Hospital. At another shelter  Alphonso Syville  45  said that as much as he tried  he could not block out the incessant coughing that he heard from a man a few feet away. At Delta Manor  a shelter in the Bronx  Christian Cascone recalled how a roommate confronted another resident who had poor hygiene and would not wash his hands. The resident “said something like  ‘Well  if God chooses for me to die  I’ll die ’” said Mr. Cascone  37. “My roommate said  ‘Well  the good Lord also wants the rest of us to be healthy  too ’” he said. While much of New York City is staying inside  a crisis has taken hold among a population for whom social distancing is nearly impossible: the more than 17 000 men and women  many of them already in poor health  who sleep in roughly 100 group or “congregate” shelters for single adults. Most live in dormitories that are fertile fields for the virus  with beds close enough for people sleeping in them to hold hands. And rather than keeping people away from shelters  the virus has driven them in. Some inmates released from Rikers Island to control the outbreak in the jail have wound up in shelters. And with the outdoor safety net falling apart — few pedestrians to beg for change; public bathrooms shut; many soup kitchens closed for lack of food and volunteers — the nightly shelter population has consistently reached levels seen only a few times in the last decade  and usually only on the most frigid nights of winter. “When all of those systems simultaneously break down  you’re going to get this influx into congregate situations ” said Joshua Goldfein  a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society. “It’s a time bomb.” Officially as of Sunday  23 shelter residents have died in hospitals  among them 14 men and two women from assessment centers and shelters for single adults where multiple  unrelated people share rooms  according to the Department of Homeless Services. And 371 people from shelters had tested positive for the virus  about 80 percent of them from the single-adult facilities  though those adults represent less than a quarter of the homeless population. The rest are mostly families who often stay in studio-like units by themselves. While total prevention is impossible  the city has been scrambling to at least lower the risk. Paying an average cost of at least $174 a night  it has been renting hotel rooms  empty for lack of tourists  to isolate shelter residents who have symptoms or tested positive as well those potentially exposed. On Saturday  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that 2 500 more shelter residents would be moved to hotels by the end of April  in addition to 3 500 who were already sharing rooms in hotels before the virus hit because there was no room in traditional shelters. Residents who are at least 70 years old  and some residents in the 10 most densely packed shelters  are also being moved to hotels  whether they have symptoms or not. Some homeless families previously staying in hotels are being moved to make room for those residents. Steven Banks  the commissioner of social services  said the city also has purchased 24 hand-washing stations and 36 portable toilets to be installed in 12 street locations  for those homeless people who refuse to go to shelters. Shelters are staggering meal times  and temporarily dropping rules that require residents to leave dorms during cleaning  to reduce the chance the residents will go out and then return after having been exposed. Simply closing the shelters to stop the spread  as if they were dining halls or Broadway theaters  is not an option. “We’re still open and offering services ” Mr. Banks said. “Others have shut their doors.” The number of New York shelter infections does not capture the scope of the peril; they reflect mainly people who had been so ill that they had to be taken to city hospitals to be tested and treated. The figures do not include people staying in shelters run by charities or other public agencies. Other cities with significant homeless populations have begun to see similar problems. San Francisco tested everyone inside its largest shelter last week  and so far 81 residents and 10 workers have been confirmed as infected. The city has lifted its ban on tent encampments as long as the tents are at least six feet apart. Even before the pandemic hit  homelessness was an intractable problem for Mayor Bill de Blasio. He took office in 2014 vowing to reduce the number of homeless  but it has only grown  to an estimated 79 000 people  in part because of rising rents beyond the reach of low-income families. Since 2014  the budget for homeless services has doubled to about $3.2 billion  according to the city comptroller’s office. The shelter system is a patchwork of 450 buildings  including studios for families with children  hotel rooms with double beds  privately owned but decrepit apartments and cavernous spaces with rows of beds  like the mammoth Bedford-Atlantic Armory shelter in Brooklyn. The decentralized nature of the system  and the transience of its clients  have made the application of new policies somewhat ragged. Some residents in shelters and peace officers working in them say some of the preventive measures have not been put into practice or are being ignored by residents. “If this is a worldwide epidemic  we should have a fair chance to protect ourselves ” said Roberto Mangual  27  who stays at the Clarke Thomas shelter on Wards Island  where Mr. Coleman was allowed to return. “We don’t really have that chance in a men’s shelter  to be honest.” Mr. Coleman said that after he spent a night back at Clarke Thomas  the staff gave him a MetroCard to travel to one of the quarantine hotels in Long Island City  Queens. After an inquiry by The New York Times  the homeless services department sent a message to shelter providers reminding them that anyone returning from a hospital with symptoms of Covid-19 should be put in isolation and not placed on public transportation. In a phone interview from the hotel on Saturday  Mr. Coleman said he believed he had contracted the virus at the shelter. “I was around a lot of people coughing  throwing up  sneezing ” he said. He said that he was happy to now be in a room by himself  where he said he was getting round-the-clock medical attention. “If I need medication  I call them and they send up some aspirin ” he said. On Sunday he was moved to another hotel specifically for seniors. Stephen Mott  chief of staff for HELP USA  which operates Clarke Thomas  said the shelter has been under a great deal of strain but acknowledged that it needed to do better. “We’re up against something huge ” he said. “Things that we used to let slide we can’t let slide anymore.” At the city-run Catherine Street Shelter in Lower Manhattan  where 100 women live  many residents are not taking precautions  like washing their hands and staying six feet apart  one woman who lives there said. They brush against each other when walking in a narrow stairwell. The staff changed the configuration of the cafeteria so that there were only two chairs per table  but some residents simply moved chairs so they could sit together  said the woman  who did not want to be identified because she feared retaliation from staff in the shelter. Derek Jackson  director of the law enforcement division in Teamsters Local 237  a city employee union  said about 550 peace officers work in the shelter system  and as of early last week  26 had tested positive. Another 41 shelter workers also had tested positive as of last week  according to the city. “We’re not sure they are being transparent with how many clients are sick with this disease ” Mr. Jackson said of the city homeless agency. “We don’t know who is putting us at risk at the shelters.” Mr. Jackson said the city was slow to provide masks  gloves and other personal protection equipment to the officers. The homeless services agency has been dealing with the same supply shortages as everyone else  said Mr. Banks  the commissioner. Last week  after finding masks to purchase  the agency began distributing 100 000 masks to shelters for employees  including peace officers  and now has an additional shipment of 500 000 masks  along with sanitizer and gloves to give to peace officers. Mr. Banks also tapped into Robin Hood  the philanthropic foundation  to donate masks for shelter residents and people living on the street. But the inability of shelter residents to self-quarantine is still taking a toll. There is no staying at home when you do not have one. At Opportunity House  a charity-run shelter in Brooklyn  many residents are older and have serious health issues  including problems with vision  said David Gaynor  60  who is staying there. “Some of the literature  you have to be an ant to read it ” he said. Camba  which operates Opportunity House  said it is has been taking measures to keep residents safe. “We understand the anxiety that everyone is experiencing ” the nonprofit said in a statement. Mr. Gaynor  who was interviewed while wearing a green bandanna around his neck that he could pull over his mouth  recalled one resident who did not speak English well and had trouble explaining his symptoms. The staff finally took action when they saw him bowled over and heard the man say the words he knew in English. “Am-bu-lance. Hos-pi-tal ” Mr. Gaynor said  enunciating each word. “Everybody understands sick ” he said. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/nyregion/00nyvirus-homelessNEW1/00nyvirus-homelessNEW1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-nikita-stewart/author-nikita-stewart-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/nyregion/00nyvirus-homeless/00nyvirus-homeless-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-endorsement.html, us politics, Bernie Sanders Endorses Joe Biden for President, At a moment when Mr. Biden still faces deep skepticism from many younger progressive voters  Mr. Sanders’s support is a major step toward Democratic unity against President Trump., Supported by At a moment when Mr. Biden still faces deep skepticism from many younger progressive voters  Mr. Sanders’s support is a major step toward Democratic unity against President Trump. By Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the Democratic nominee for president on Monday  adding the weight of his left-wing support to Mr. Biden’s candidacy and taking a major step toward bringing unity to the party’s effort to unseat President Trump in November. The decision by Mr. Sanders to back his former rival is an unmistakable signal to his supporters — who are known for their intense loyalty — that they should do so as well  at a moment when Mr. Biden still faces deep skepticism from many younger progressive voters. In a surprise joint appearance over live-streamed video  the two men revealed a rapprochement forged amid extraordinary circumstances just five days after Mr. Sanders withdrew  a sign of how profoundly the coronavirus pandemic has changed the race. The uncertainty caused by the virus  the vast damage to the American economy and the fervent desire to deprive Mr. Trump of a second term prompted an earlier-than-expected alliance between two ideological rivals  aimed at bringing together disparate factions of the party. “We need you in the White House ” Mr. Sanders said to Mr. Biden. “And I will do all that I can to see that that happens.” Mr. Biden said: “I’m going to need you. Not just to win the campaign  but to govern.” The coalescence behind Mr. Biden will gain even more strength with the backing of Senator Elizabeth Warren  who is expected to endorse him soon  according to people familiar with the matter. There is not any holdup or demand for concessions for her support  these people said. Ms. Warren is the only major former rival yet to endorse the former vice president  though only because she has left the timing of an announcement up to Mr. Biden’s team. The challenge now for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders is to create an agenda that hews to Mr. Biden’s relatively moderate policy views  and draws in progressives  but also seems big enough to match the moment in the country. It is a complicated task for both of them: Mr. Biden  who easily won the Wisconsin primary in results announced Monday evening  will have to persuade more Sanders-supporting liberals that he will fight for their interests. Mr. Sanders is essentially committing himself vouching for Mr. Biden or at least bring more of his followers into the Biden camp. Neither man can predict with any assurance how their political alliance will pan out. Already  progressive groups and activists were expressing skepticism about how far Mr. Biden would go to incorporate Mr. Sanders’s followers. “Winning over Senator Sanders is one thing  but Joe Biden shouldn’t think that the work is over ’’ said Evan Weber  political director for the Sunrise Movement  an organization of young climate activists that had endorsed Mr. Sanders. He added  “There is still work to do to win over progressive leaders and young people.” In moving so quickly to embrace more of the policy ideas and political language of Mr. Sanders and the left  Mr. Biden is providing the clearest sign yet that the virus has changed the political equation and the rhythms of the election season. He also has indicated an intention to expand beyond his primary campaign message of restoring the nation and Washington to a pre-Trump era. Progressives have been scathingly critical of that argument  saying that it neglects the many inequities in the economic  health care and immigration systems and in other areas where lower-income people struggled in the Obama era and under past presidents. But at a moment of a presidential campaign when candidates often move to the center  this expanded message could prove perilous if progressives push Mr. Biden to make policy concessions and changes that start to concern more moderate Democrats and independent voters who do not support some planks of a far-reaching liberal agenda. The alliance announced Monday was a sharp departure from the drawn-out  often-acrimonious process of reconciliation between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. And it makes good on the promise Mr. Sanders has been making for months: That he would support the eventual Democratic nominee and do everything he could to defeat Mr. Trump  whom he has called “the most dangerous president” in modern times. Former Senator Christopher J. Dodd  Democrat of Connecticut and a Biden supporter  said the quick cooperation was a reflection of the friendly personal relationship the two men enjoyed. Mr. Sanders was said to be greatly appreciative that Mr. Biden did not try to rush him out of the race. “A lot of people think it’s old-fashioned  being polite to people  listening to people  paying attention to them ” he said. “It’s still important to people. Personal relationships mean a lot.” Behind the scenes  Biden advisers and allies are already reaching out to former members of the Sanders campaign  according to three people familiar with the discussions  and hope to eventually bring some on board. That news of the endorsement did not leak beforehand was another signal of the growing unity between the campaigns. Only a small group of people on each campaign knew it was happening  according to a person familiar with the discussions. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden have also spoken multiple times since her exit about policy issues  including the plan that Mr. Biden has developed to respond to the pandemic. At the staff level  Ms. Warren’s chief campaign strategist  Joe Rospars  and Anita Dunn  a senior adviser to Mr. Biden  have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps. Ms. Dunn  along with Ron Klain  another longtime Biden adviser  played a central role in negotiations with the Sanders camp in recent weeks  while a top Sanders political adviser  Jeff Weaver  and campaign manager Faiz Shakir  represented the Vermont senator. The scene on Monday was a striking example of the ways the coronavirus has upended traditional campaigning. In normal times  both men most likely would have appeared onstage together at a rally — or at least done so at an event with more pomp. Instead  they appeared at their homes  as they have been doing for weeks. When Mr. Sanders officially declared his endorsement  Mr. Biden seemed visibly moved. “Oh!” Mr. Biden said  before dropping his head as if he hardly saw it coming. The two men said they would form “task forces” on issues including the economy  education  immigration  health care  criminal justice and climate change. Mr. Biden’s campaign said that the groups would include “policy experts and leaders that represent the diverse viewpoints of the Democratic Party ” and promised updates on the groups’ progress. Two senior Biden advisers  Cristóbal Alex and Symone D. Sanders  who both have relationships in the progressive sphere  have been reaching out to leading liberal organizations  including groups that focus on immigrants’ rights and on climate. And Representative Cedric Richmond  Mr. Biden’s campaign co-chairman  has spoken with his counterpart on the Sanders campaign  Representative Ro Khanna  about the need to unite the party. Still  Mr. Sanders’s endorsement surprised many of the progressive grass-roots groups that had endorsed his candidacy and that are struggling with the prospect of the more moderate Mr. Biden becoming the nominee. Some worried that it undercut the leverage Mr. Sanders might have to persuade Mr. Biden to make policy concessions. “We want those task forces to be given real power in the campaign and in the party apparatus ” Mr. Weber  of the Sunrise Movement  said. “Not just gestures but real commitments.” It is unclear how much sway Mr. Sanders would have over Mr. Biden’s campaign decisions  including his potential cabinet or vice-presidential selections. In a Friday interview with PBS NewsHour  Mr. Sanders acknowledged a preference for Mr. Biden to pick a more progressive running mate but said he had not weighed in on the choice. “Joe is going to have to make that decision himself ” Mr. Sanders said. Throughout the campaign  Mr. Sanders had often referred to Mr. Biden as his “friend” and the two men have a personal relationship that has remained intact. Even as the field dwindled  Mr. Sanders was reluctant to attack Mr. Biden directly and largely did so only for a brief spell near the end of his campaign that included the last debate — and only on policy. That comity was on display Monday in an appearance that at times resembled a slapdash buddy skit  with levity that offered a brief respite from the seriousness of a national health crisis. The two men seemed to delight in talking to each other — bantering away on subjects that generally sounded as if they had been cleared with campaign aides. “Do you have any questions for me  Bernie?” Mr. Biden said. “I did  Joe ” he said. Both gushed their effusive praise. Near the end  when Mr. Biden asked Mr. Sanders if there was anything else he wanted to do  Mr. Sanders quipped that they should “play some chess.” “I’d like to play chess!” Mr. Biden said. But Mr. Sanders was out of moves. As Mr. Biden’s live stream drew to a close  a message popped up on his one-time rival’s video screen: “You are muted by host.” Shane Goldmacher and Astead W.

By Michael Corkery and David Yaffe-Bellany The nation’s food supply chain is showing signs of strain  as increasing numbers of workers are falling ill with the coronavirus in meat processing plants  warehouses and grocery stores. The spread of the virus through the food and grocery industry is expected to cause disruptions in production and distribution of certain products like pork  industry executives  labor unions and analysts have warned in recent days. The issues follow nearly a month of stockpiling of food and other essentials by panicked shoppers that have tested supply networks as never before. Industry leaders and observers acknowledge the shortages could increase  but they insist it is more of an inconvenience than a major problem. People will have enough to eat; they just may not have the usual variety. The food supply remains robust  they say  with hundreds of millions of pounds of meat in cold storage. There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food or its packaging  according to the Department of Agriculture. Still  the illnesses have the potential to cause shortages lasting weeks for a few products  creating further anxiety for Americans already shaken by how difficult it can be to find high-demand staples like flour and eggs. “You might not get what you want when you want it ” said Christine McCracken  a meat industry analyst at Rabobank in New York. “Consumers like to have a lot of different choices  and the reality is in the short term  we just don’t have the labor to make that happen.” In one of the most significant signs of pressure since the pandemic began  Smithfield Foods became the latest company to announce a shutdown  announcing Sunday that it would close its processing plant in Sioux Falls  S.D.  after 230 workers became ill with the virus. The plant produces more than 5 percent of the nation’s pork. “The closure of this facility  combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry  is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply ” Smithfield’s chief executive  Kenneth M. Sullivan  said in a statement. As of Saturday  the plant’s Covid-19 cases were more than half South Dakota’s active total  Gov. Kristi Noem said. She called the outbreak an “alarming statistic” and asked Smithfield to shut down the facility for two weeks. The problems at the Sioux Falls pork plant show the food processing industry’s vulnerability to an outbreak. Employees often work shoulder to shoulder  and some companies have granted sick leave only to employees who test positive for the coronavirus. That potentially leaves on the job thousands of other infected workers who haven’t been tested  hastening the infection’s spread. Other major processors have had to shut down plants. JBS USA  the world’s largest meat processor  closed a plant in Pennsylvania for two weeks. Last week  Cargill closed a facility in Pennsylvania where it produces steaks  ground beef and ground pork. And Tyson halted operations at a pork plant in Iowa after more than two dozen workers tested positive. “Labor is going to be the biggest thing that can break ” said Karan Girotra  a supply-chain expert at Cornell University. “If large numbers of people start getting sick in rural America  all bets are off.” At the other end of the supply chain  grocery stores are also dealing with increasing illnesses among workers  as well as absences by those afraid to go in to work. Even as company officials called them “essential” for their role in feeding the country  grocery store workers went weeks without being provided with face masks and other protective gear. Some food companies have been slow to provide the gear  while others tried but found that their orders were rerouted to the health care industry  where there is also a dire need. A few grocery workers say they are still waiting to be supplied with masks  despite federal health guidelines that recommend everybody wear one in public. The workers also face a threat from their exposure to customers  who continue to stock up on food. Some  the workers say  don’t wear masks and fail to keep an adequate level of social distancing. There are no government agencies tracking illnesses among food industry workers nationwide. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union  which represents 1.3 million grocery store  food processing and meat packing employees  said on Monday that at least 1 500 of its members had been infected with the virus and that 30 of them have died. “The Covid-19 pandemic represents a clear and present danger to our workers and our nation’s food supply ” U.F.C.W. International’s president  Marc Perrone  said. Even before the illnesses began to spread through the industry  the supply chain had been tested intensely. Truck drivers  who were already scarce before the pandemic  couldn’t make deliveries fast enough. Hot dog factories and dairy farmers ramped up production in response to waves of panic buying. Those surges continue to take a toll on a system that had been built largely for customers seeking speed and convenience  not stockpiling. On Sunday  Amazon said it was getting new customers seeking online grocery delivery from Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh to effectively sign up for a wait list. It’s an unusual concession for an internet giant that is used to unimpeded growth. On some days  shoppers still cannot find flour  eggs or other staples that are in high demand. Retailers and manufacturers have offered reassurances that these shortages are temporary and merely reflect a distribution and production network that cannot work fast enough. The parts of the food system that will suffer the worst disruptions are the ones dependent on heavily consolidated supply chains that employ large numbers of people  Mr. Girotra of Cornell said. The Smithfield plant in South Dakota is a stark example of a vulnerable link in the chain. On its own  it produces 130 million servings of food per week. It employs 3 700 people  many of whom work closely together deboning and cutting up meat. Last week  South Dakota officials watched the number of cases there increase at an alarming rate. Smithfield said it would shut down the building for three days to sanitize the facility. But as the number of Covid-19 cases surpassed more than half of all cases in Sioux Falls and the surrounding county  state officials asked the plant to close for 14 days “to protect the employees  the families  the Sioux Falls community and the people of South Dakota ” Governor Noem said on Saturday. The next day  Smithfield said it would shut down “until further notice” and pay its workers for the next two weeks. The state has not reported outbreaks at any other meat processing plants. South Dakota officials said Smithfield had ramped up testing of its employees  suggesting that this could have resulted in rates that were higher than in other populations in the state. Some big food producers are coming up with contingency plans. Absences have risen at some plants run by the Mississippi-based chicken processor Sanderson Farms  though not at a level that would significantly disrupt production  said Mike Cockrell  the company’s chief financial officer. The company has explored alternatives in case large numbers of its workers become sick. Much of the labor at a processing plant involves deboning chicken and dividing it into cuts like breasts  thighs and wings. A reduced staff could continue packaging chicken but skip the labor-intensive process of dividing up the birds. “You could change your mix and produce a less consumer-friendly product with fewer people ” Mr. Cockrell said. “That’s not a disaster.” At the grocery store  he said  “you would see a whole chicken  and you could take that chicken home.” In the grocery industry  many of the solutions to keeping the supply chain functioning are also simple  workers say. The U.F.C.W.  for instance  is urging states to mandate that shoppers wear masks and appealing to customers to “shop smart” by refraining from touching products  using a shopping list and making fewer trips to the store. Aaron Squeo  who works in the meat department at a Kroger supermarket in Madison Heights  Mich.  said customers needed to practice better social distancing. “I have seen whole families out like it’s an outing ” Mr. Squeo said. “This can’t continue like this. We need to truly change how we shop. Our lives are at stake.” Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/business/13virus-foodchain-1/merlin_170698338_3cd8e569-67c1-464a-bf4b-ad153405ec67-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

But economic activity is likely to remain subdued until the threat of the coronavirus recedes., Supported by President Trump has predicted an economic boom once stay-at-home and other restrictions are lifted. But economic activity is likely to remain subdued until the threat of the coronavirus recedes. By Jim Tankersley WASHINGTON — Walter Isenberg is the sort of business owner President Trump has in mind when he talks about the need to start lifting coronavirus lockdowns and reopen the American economy. Mr. Isenberg’s hotel and restaurant group in Denver has seen its revenues drop from $3 million a day last year to $40 000 a day now. But Mr. Isenberg has no expectation that his company  Sage Hospitality Group  will see the quick economic “boom” that Mr. Trump has predicted  even after state officials allow his properties to begin hosting customers again. “It’s just going to be a very long and slow recovery until such time as there is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine ” Mr. Isenberg  who has furloughed more than 5 000 of his 6 000 employees  said in an interview. “I’m not a scientist  but I just don’t see the psyche of people — I don’t see people coming out of this and rushing out to start traveling and having big conventions.” The president is in a rush to lift quarantines and stay-at-home restrictions that have brought an 11-year economic expansion to an abrupt end and knocked millions of people out of work. Mr. Trump has predicted that once the economy restarts  it will rocket itself out of a deep recession and lead to an economic boom “perhaps like never before.” Companies affected by the shutdowns say restarting the economy will not be that easy. So do a wide variety of economic and survey data  which suggest that the economy will recover slowly even after the government begins to ease limits on public gatherings and allow certain shuttered restaurants and shops to reopen. The evidence suggests it is not just stay-at-home orders and other government restrictions that have chilled economic activity in the United States over the past month: It is also a behavioral response from workers and consumers scared of contracting the virus. Data shows that unemployment claims rose and restaurant reservations vanished even before the lockdown orders hit  as nervous consumers retreated into their homes. And they show consumers are unlikely to return to airports  restaurants and sporting venues en masse any time soon. Until Americans feel confident that their risks of contracting the coronavirus have fallen — either through widespread testing or a vaccine — many economists and business owners say there will be no rapid economic rebound. “You can’t just turn the light switch on and have everyone go back to work  as much as businesses would love to do that ” Suzanne Clark  the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  said in an interview. “It’s going to be the opposite of a green light. It’s going to go from red to yellow and then green.” “It would be good to get a yellow light from the president to reopen ” Ms. Clark said. “But then on the ground it’s going to matter  how safe do people feel?” The president’s desire to reopen the economy can be seen in the data: The crisis has already pushed more than 16 million people out of work in the past three weeks. Forecasters agree that a recession has already begun  with the only disagreement centered on how deep and painful it will ultimately be. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper released on Monday by economists from Northwestern  Stanford  the University of Chicago and Boston University predicts that the economy will shrink by 11 percent at year’s end from the same time the year before. That would be its sharpest contraction since 1946. At a White House briefing on Monday  Mr. Trump said the administration was “very close to completing a plan to open our country hopefully even ahead of schedule ” saying it would “soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states.” Mr. Trump added that “we want to be very  very safe” in terms of lifting restrictions  but said that Americans were eager to get back to work. “I think we’re going to boom” once the economy reopens  he said. Still  many economists warn that rushing back toward normal life too quickly  without the safeguards needed to prevent a second wave of the outbreak  could simply worsen the economic damage that Mr. Trump is trying to fix. Re-infection rates climbed in China  Singapore and Hong Kong after leaders eased strict economic restrictions that had initially slowed the virus’s spread. Uncertainty about the virus has slowed economic activity even in places without state or local restrictions on activity. “States that haven’t yet closed businesses or put their populations on some sort of lockdown aren’t escaping enormous spikes in unemployment ” said Ernie Tedeschi  a managing director at Evercore ISI and a former Treasury Department economist. “The pain is not just deep  it’s wide. This punctuates that the fundamental problem with the economy right now is the pandemic.” Mr. Tedeschi’s research underscores the degree to which Americans have suffered economic harm from the virus  no matter what form of restrictions their leaders have placed on business activity and travel. Stay-at-home orders have not been evenly applied across America: Some states imposed them early  some imposed them later and some still have not imposed them at all. Yet all states have seen unemployment claims rise in recent weeks. Mr. Tedeschi found the gap between more and less restrictive states — when comparing their normal levels of unemployment claims and current levels — has quickly narrowed. By the first week of April  claims were only about 23 percent higher in more restrictive states than less restrictive ones  adjusted for population. Adam Ozimek  the chief economist at Upwork  found a similar pattern in restaurant reservation data from the online service OpenTable: declining activity even when restrictions were not in place. He plotted the drop in reservations made using the service across American cities and found the falloff began  typically  several days before local officials first imposed restrictions on dining out in their cities. “How safe people perceive it to be ” Mr. Ozimek said  “matters independently from the shutdowns.” Mr. Trump is set to establish a task force to examine when to begin lifting the restrictions that state and local officials have imposed on public gatherings and so-called nonessential businesses across the country. A nationwide online survey by the data firm Civis Analytics over the past two weeks found more than eight in 10 Americans support restrictions on restaurant and gym openings  and nearly as many back “shelter in place” orders. A survey last week by Seton Hall University found that seven in 10 Americans would not feel comfortable attending a sporting event until a vaccine for the virus was developed. New polling by the Sports and Leisure Research Group  Engagious and ROKK Solutions finds that only about a third of Americans would take a commercial flight  see a movie in a theater or visit a theme park now if they were allowed to do so. In follow-up interviews  respondents stressed two steps that would help them feel comfortable resuming those and other economic activities: reassurances from medical professionals and the development of a vaccine. The drop in Americans’ plans to spend on travel and leisure activities in the next year drastically exceeds what similar polling found after the 2008 financial crisis and the Sept. 11  2001  attacks  said Jon Last  the president of the Sports and Leisure Research Group. “We are seeing people really hesitant to get back to normal ” he said. “I’m scared to death  frankly  what our sales volume might be when we reopen ” Cameron Mitchell  an Ohio-based restaurateur  said in an interview last week. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce president  Ms. Clark  told members of the business advocacy group in a letter on Monday that “returning to work will be gradual” and phased in  and depend on a variety of developments across the country including additional access to testing of employees and the resolution of a wide range of legal liability issues in areas like employee health privacy. Mr. Isenberg  who began his career as a dishwasher  says he is eager to get his employees back to work. But he sees economic hardships for his industry continuing through the end of the year  at least. Mr. Isenberg said there was a hope he holds onto. “I have a saying ” he said  “when we woke up this morning  we were one day closer to a vaccine.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/world/asia/china-mekong-drought.html, world asia, China Limited the Mekong’s Flow. Other Countries Suffered a Drought., New research show that Beijing’s engineers appear to have directly caused the record low levels of water in Thailand  Laos  Cambodia and Vietnam., Supported by New research show that Beijing’s engineers appear to have directly caused the record low levels of water in Thailand  Laos  Cambodia and Vietnam. By Hannah Beech BANGKOK — As China was stricken by the coronavirus in late February  its foreign minister addressed a concerned crowd in Laos  where farmers and fishers across the Mekong River region were contending with the worst drought in living memory. His message: We feel your pain. The foreign minister  Wang Yi  said China was also suffering from arid conditions that were sucking water from one of the world’s most productive rivers. But new research from American climatologists shows for the first time that China  where the headwaters of the Mekong spring forth from the Tibetan Plateau  was not experiencing the same hardship at all. Instead  Beijing’s engineers appear to have directly caused the record low water levels by limiting the river’s flow. “The satellite data doesn’t lie  and there was plenty of water in the Tibetan Plateau  even as countries like Cambodia and Thailand were under extreme duress ” said Alan Basist  who co-wrote the report  which was released on Monday  for Eyes on Earth  a water resources monitor. “There was just a huge volume of water that was being held back in China ” Mr. Basist added. The Mekong is one of the most fertile rivers on earth  nurturing tens of millions of people with its nutrient rich waters and fisheries. But a series of dams  mostly in China  have robbed the river’s riches. Those who depend on its inland fisheries say their catches have declined precipitously. Persistent droughts and sudden floods have buffeted farmers. Beijing’s control of the upstream Mekong  which provides as much as 70 percent of the downstream water in the dry season  has raised hackles  even though the Southeast Asian nations depend on trade with China. While the Chinese government has introduced a global development program that it says will benefit poorer trading partners  a backlash is growing among countries that feel they are losing out. “The problem is that the Chinese elite see water as something for their use  not as a shared commodity ” said Brian Eyler  director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia program and author of “Last Days of the Mighty Mekong.” As China’s geopolitical weight has grown  its leaders have cast the nation as a different kind of superpower  one that is concerned  as the Chinese phrasing goes  with “win-win” relationships with other nations. But some countries  like Sri Lanka and Djibouti  have fallen into what critics fear are debt traps  as strategic projects end up in Chinese hands. Other African and Asian nations are worried that China is simply another imperial power eager to vacuum up natural resources without concern for the local populace. “This is part of China’s business development ” said Chainarong Setthachua  a lecturer and Mekong expert at Mahasarakham University in northeastern Thailand. “The lay people who depend on the resources of the Mekong River for their livelihoods and income are automatically excluded.” The data modeling created by Mr. Basist and his colleague Claude Williams measures the various components of a river’s flow  from snow and glacial melt to rainfall and soil moisture. The scientists found that for most years  the natural  unimpeded flow of the upstream Mekong roughly tracked water levels measured downstream at a gauge in Thailand  with occasional exceptions when dam reservoirs in China were being filled or released. When there was a seasonal drought in China  the five downstream nations — Myanmar  Thailand  Laos  Cambodia and Vietnam — would eventually feel it. When there was overabundant water in China  floods ensued in the Mekong basin. But during last year’s wet season  the fortunes of the river’s two parts diverged in dramatic fashion. As China’s section of the Mekong welcomed an above average volume of water  downstream countries were stricken by a drought so crushing that parts of the river dried up entirely  leaving cracked riverbed exposed in a season when fishing should have been plentiful. At one gauge in Chiang Saen  in northern Thailand  such low water levels had never been recorded before. Overall  during the 28-year period they studied this gauge  Mr. Basist and his colleague calculated that dams in China had held back more than 410 feet of river height. While addressing regional foreign ministers in February  Mr. Wang  the Chinese foreign minister  contended that China  too  was suffering. He suggested that the Chinese leadership was being magnanimous by sending water downstream  especially at a time when Beijing was contending with a severe coronavirus outbreak. “Though China itself has also been afflicted by the drought and a serious shortage of precipitation in the upper reaches  it has overcome various difficulties to increase the water discharge ” he said. Mr. Basist disputed this take. “You look at our mapping  and it’s bright blue with plenty of water in China and bright red from an extreme lack of water in Thailand and Cambodia ” he said. “China can regulate this river’s flow through dams  and that appears to be exactly what it’s doing.” Adding to the downstream pain were sudden releases of water from China  which often came unannounced and drowned crops that had been planted near the banks because of the drought. “The water release by China is political ” said Mr. Chainarong  of Mahasarakham University. “It’s made out to be them doing a favor. They create damage  but they ask for gratitude.” While the Mekong is a lifeline for residents of downstream nations  the river rushes through narrow gorges in China  making it impractical for economic activity other than hydropower. At the turn of this century  the Chinese government  whose leadership at the time was dominated by engineers  began accelerating plans to dam the Lancang  as the Mekong is known in China. Today  the Chinese section of the river in the nation’s southwest is punctuated by 11 major dams  which produce far more power than the region needs. Other great rivers that begin in the icy reaches of the Tibetan Plateau  like the Brahmaputra  a holy river to Hindus in India  have also been dammed in China. The existing energy glut was one reason Chinese environmentalists succeeded in persuading the government to shelve plans to dam another river in the region  the Nu  which becomes the Salween when it enters Myanmar. Yet even as Beijing began its hydropower push on the Mekong  it refused to join Thailand  Cambodia  Vietnam and Laos in a regional group dedicated to the river’s health. In one survey commissioned by the group  the Mekong River Commission  scientists warned that a dam boom on the Mekong could rob the river of 97 percent of the sediment that flows to its mouth in Vietnam. “The river will be dead ” said Niwat Roykaew  a community organizer and conservationist in northern Thailand. Instead  Beijing created its own Lancang-Mekong Cooperation initiative and financed a lavish building for the group in Cambodia  where Prime Minister Hun Sen has brought the country firmly into Beijing’s orbit. Critics accuse the Beijing-funded initiative of being less a mechanism for protecting the river and more a mouthpiece for China’s campaign on the Mekong. But even Mr. Hun Sen  Asia’s longest serving autocrat  appears to have been shaken by the devastating lack of water in the Mekong  which accelerated last July. The energy ministry announced last month that Cambodia was suspending plans for dams on the Mekong  which would have been mostly funded by China. Meanwhile  the water reserves in China swelled  as dam reservoirs filled with the glacial melt that has fed the Mekong for millenniums. “Glaciers are bank accounts of water but with climate change they’re melting fast ” Mr. Basist said. “The Chinese are building safe deposit boxes on the upper Mekong because they know the bank account is going to be depleted eventually and they want to keep it in reserve.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.

By Anatoly Kurmanaev CARACAS  Venezuela — Only a month ago  President Nicolás Maduro seemed to be consolidating his autocratic rule. The opposition was fading into irrelevance  international pressure was waning and the country’s devastating economic woes were finally easing  if only a bit. Then  suddenly  a global pandemic shut down what’s left of the economy  the collapse of global oil prices wiped out Venezuela’s main remaining economic lifeline and the United States mounted a determined  new effort to oust Mr. Maduro. Long a skilled political fighter  and survivor  the Venezuelan leader now confronts one of the most complex crises of a seven-year rule that has been filled with them. “The regime is in survival mode ” said Michael Penfold  a Caracas-based fellow at the Wilson Center  a research group. “The country is entering into a very fragile equilibrium that’s going to be increasingly difficult to maintain.” At stake are the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in South America’s poorest nation  who face a seventh consecutive year of economic calamity  a new bout of hyperinflation and the deadly threat of the coronavirus. Mr. Maduro has had his back to the wall many times before  but he has managed to adapt to multiple rounds of American sanctions and fend off a variety of challenges from within  from coup plots to a drone attack. The current combination of global forces  however  has thrust his government into uncharted territory  exposing the shallowness of his economic resources and the limits of his international support. Mr. Maduro’s latest round of troubles began on March 8. On that day  Saudi Arabia and Russia scrapped an agreement to hold back their domestic production  unleashing a price war and plunging the global energy industry into its biggest crisis in decades. Within days  much of Venezuela’s crude oil  the country’s main export  became unprofitable to extract  causing production to plummet. The plunge in prices also helped unravel a complex system of trades that had allowed Venezuela to exchange its crude oil for imported fuel  bypassing American sanctions. Left without the means to import or produce gasoline  Venezuela has come to a near standstill. Drivers line up for days at gas stations  even in the normally privileged capital  Caracas  as helmeted soldiers with automatic weapons guard scarce supplies that are now mostly reserved for officials and emergency workers. “We’ve never been worse off in our lives ” said Ivan Herrera  a rancher from central Barinas state  who can no longer bring his cattle to market. “We’re paralyzed.” Angry motorists have clashed with gas station guards and blocked roads in some rural towns. Farmers  having no fuel to tend their fields  have left crops to rot even as about half of Venezuelans don’t get enough to eat. Almost overnight  Venezuela went from having the world’s cheapest consumer gasoline prices to having among the most expensive — $15 a gallon on the burgeoning black market  more than twice the country’s minimum monthly wage. The fuel shortages have been compounded by the soured relationship between Mr. Maduro and what had been his main oil partner  Rosneft  Russia’s state-controlled oil company. Mr. Maduro’s ill-timed decision in February to review the country’s contracts with Rosneft created tensions just as the company was smarting from a U.S. decision to sanction two of its subsidiaries for supporting the Venezuelan president. As a result  Rosneft said late last month that it was halting operations in Venezuela and selling all of its assets in the country to a company wholly owned by the Russian government. Rosneft had been trading Venezuelan oil to small refineries in China for gasoline and money. While in theory another Russian company can do the same  it can’t do so immediately in the absence of Rosneft’s sophisticated trading systems — choking off  for now  a source of gasoline and funds for Mr. Maduro’s government. Mr. Maduro has scrambled to obtain gasoline instead from trusted  insider business people who have helped supply his government with essential products in difficult times in the past. Such a patchwork would provide  at best  temporary relief to Venezuela’s major cities  but does little to address the structural problems causing the shortages  said Asdrúbal Oliveros  head of the Caracas-based economic consultancy Ecoanalítica. Mr. Oliveros said he expected the Venezuelan economy to shrink 25 percent this year  which  if it proves accurate  would be devastating for a nation that has already seen the biggest peacetime decline of gross domestic output in modern history. The economic crisis is building as Venezuela confronts the coronavirus epidemic  which health experts say could overwhelm the country’s depleted health care system. Mr. Maduro was among the first Latin American leaders to act against the virus  rolling out a national lockdown on March 15  two days after confirming the first infection in the country. The lockdown  combined with gasoline shortages and Venezuela’s international isolation  may be slowing the spread of infection domestically  at least for now. By Monday  official figures show Venezuela had 181 cases and nine deaths  significantly fewer than most of its neighbors. The closed roads  shops and government buildings  however  have worsened economic pain in a country where the vast majority of people have little or no savings. The government will struggle to maintain social distancing measures long term  said Luis Pedro España  a sociologist at Caracas’s Andrés Bello Catholic University  as Mr. Maduro is forced to choose between risking further spread of the virus or social unrest born of economic catastrophe. “If this prolongs  I give it 15 days before we see street protests ” he said. “The only thing that this government truly fears is an explosion of widespread social disorder.” Mr. Maduro has few means to respond to these economic and public health challenges beyond greater repression  economists say. The tenuous uptick in consumption and private exports that was seen last year has been snuffed out by the virus lockdown and global economic downturn. The loss of oil revenue means the government has been unable to step up the importing of the food that it subsidizes for the country’s poorest. Mr. Maduro plans to distribute stipends of the nearly worthless national currency to six million workers  but economists say that will merely rekindle the country’s hyperinflation. Mr. Oliveros of Ecoanalítica expects inflation to jump to 12 000 percent this year. Just as Mr. Maduro confronted these sudden economic and public health problems  the Trump administration in March began its most determined effort to topple his government in over a year. In a rapid succession  the United States charged Mr. Maduro and his inner circle with drug trafficking  announced a major naval antidrug operation near Venezuelan waters and offered the country’s senior officials a place in a transitional government if they would abandon their president. The United States and most of the West recognize Juan Guaidó  the head of the Venezuelan Parliament  as the country’s interim president. Mr. Guaidó met this year with dozens of world leaders  including President Trump  and won assurances of continued American support  but his movement has struggled to keep up momentum at home  drawing ever-smaller crowds for rallies. The drug indictments have increased political uncertainty in Venezuela  said Mr. Penfold  the political analyst  by making Mr. Maduro even less likely to cede power through negotiations. The president may also rely more heavily on the armed forces to maintain control as the economy deteriorates  with unpredictable results  he said. “Everything appears to point to a situation that’s not sustainable ” Mr. Penfold said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re heading toward a political shift anytime soon.” Isayen Herrera contributed reporting.

The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/world/12venezuela-sub/12venezuela-sub-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/wisconsin-election-voting-rights.html, us, How a Supreme Court Decision Curtailed the Right to Vote in Wisconsin, , Supported by  By Jim Rutenberg and Nick Corasaniti The Wisconsin spring elections were less than a week away  and with the state’s coronavirus death toll mounting  Democrats were challenging Republican plans to hold the vote as scheduled. In an emergency hearing  held via videoconference  John Devaney  a lawyer for the Democrats  proposed a simple compromise: Extend the deadline for mail ballots by six days past Election Day  to April 13  to ensure that more people could vote  and vote safely. “That’s going to be much more enfranchising ” said Mr. Devaney  arguing one of the most politically freighted voting-rights cases since Bush v. Gore from his bedroom in South Carolina as his black lab  Gus  repeatedly interrupted at the door. The presiding federal judge  William M. Conley  agreed  pointing out that clerks were facing severe backlogs and delays as they struggled to meet surging demand for mail-in ballots. Yet with hours to go before Election Day  the Supreme Court reversed that decision along strict ideological lines  a decision based in large part on the majority’s assertion that the Democrats had never asked for the very extension Mr. Devaney requested in court. It was the first major voting-rights decision led by the court’s conservative newest member  Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh  and it was in keeping with a broader Republican approach that puts more weight on protecting against potential fraud — vanishingly rare in American elections — than the right to vote  with limited regard for the added burdens of the pandemic. When the state released its final vote tallies on Monday  it was clear that the decision — arrived at remotely  so the justices would not have to brave the Covid-19 conditions — had resulted in the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters  forced several thousand more to endanger their lives at polls and burdened already strained state health officials with a grim new task: tracking the extent to which in-person voting contributed to the virus’s spread in the state  a federal disaster area. Democrats had alleged that Republicans pushed to hold the election as scheduled as a voter suppression tactic meant to lower Democratic turnout and protect the conservative state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly from his liberal challenger  Jill Karofsky. In the night’s most closely watched race  Ms. Karofsky won  upsetting expectations. Nonetheless  Democrats said they would continue to consider their legal options to contend with what the State Party chair  Ben Wikler  said was “a near certainty that thousands of people were disenfranchised.” Following Ms. Karofsky’s election  he added  “The most important thing is to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” Before Judge Conley’s decision  state officials had estimated that at least 27 500 absentee ballots would come in too late to be counted — nearly five times the vote margin that decided the statewide judicial elections last year. As of Monday morning  more than 11 000 voters who requested ballots were never even sent one  according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission  though figures were continuing to update. The number of disenfranchised voters was potentially higher. As of Monday  185 000 absentee ballots remained outstanding  and election officials were trying to determine what percentage of those might have been returned had Judge Conley’s deadline of April 13 held. In Milwaukee  official tallies showed that the percentage of unreturned ballots was double its usual rate. There was also the indeterminate number of voters who were too afraid to appear at polling stations on Election Day  by which point it would have been too late to request absentee ballots. And then there was the matter of how to handle ballots that had not been postmarked with an exact date. That question went at the heart of a seemingly arcane matter that is sure to bedevil states in November: whether to count mail-in ballots based on when they arrive or when they are postmarked  which  if Wisconsin is to be a guide  is already threatening to become the “hanging chad” of the 2020 election. “Absentee ballots are going to be much more prevalent  and clerks around the country are going to be slammed the same way as they were in Wisconsin ” said Mr. Devaney  the lawyer who represented the Democrats in Wisconsin. How states settle on using postmarks  he added  “is going to be really important in terms of not disenfranchising thousands and thousands across the country.” Wisconsin elections officials have spent days since the April 7 vote trying to determine how to count batches of mail-in ballots that had no postmark or had postmarks that featured only the month — April — and not the day on which they were stamped. Because Wisconsin uses a “received-by” deadline for mail-in ballots  it has no legal definition for what constitutes an appropriate postmark on a ballot. Yet in rendering its decision imposing a postmark requirement of April 7  the Supreme Court majority wrote that “absentee ballots now must be mailed and postmarked by Election Day  Tuesday  April 7  as state law would necessarily require ” an important imprecision if not an outright error. “Because the court decided to go its own direction “ said Ann Jacobs  a Democratic appointee to the Wisconsin Elections Commission  “it created this artificial construct of a postmark without saying what a postmark is.” The lower court judge’s ruling had set April 13 as a “received-by” deadline  which would have averted such confusion. After a Republican appeal  the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  which includes Illinois  Indiana and Wisconsin  upheld the decision. Justice Kavanaugh is the member of the Supreme Court responsible for overseeing the Seventh Circuit  and the Republican National Committee’s application was addressed to him. As is usual in important cases  he referred the application to the full court. Civil rights activists have closely followed his involvement in voting rights issues since his nomination in 2018  worried that he would become a reliable fifth vote in support of laws that make voting harder  regardless of their effects on traditionally disenfranchised groups like African-American and Hispanic people. Under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.  the court had already seemed particularly inclined to favor restrictive voting laws  given its decision effectively striking down the most powerful provision protecting minority voting rights that had been enshrined in the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. The majority opinion on the Wisconsin election was unsigned  which is typical when the court rules on emergency applications. But there are good reasons to think that its principal author was Justice Kavanaugh. When the Supreme Court rules on emergency applications  the majority almost never gives reasons like the one it included with the Wisconsin decision. Justice Kavanaugh has made efforts to illuminate what practitioners call the court’s “shadow docket.” In March 2019  for instance  he was the only justice to give an explanation for the court’s decision to stay the execution of a Buddhist inmate in Texas. A month earlier  he was the only one of four dissenting justices in an abortion case to explain his thinking. Regardless of its authorship  the Wisconsin decision repeatedly mentioned that Democrats did not specifically seek to delay the absentee ballot deadline until April 13 in “preliminary injunction motions ” even though Mr. Devaney specifically did so while arguing before Judge Conley. That hearing had taken place one day after Gov. Tony Evers  a Democrat  requested a federal disaster declaration for his state. And the decision appeared to contradict the tenet it sought to uphold  that “lower federal courts should not ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.” The Supreme Court ruling  coming late on the literal eve of an election taking place under conditions that were far from ordinary  resulted in chaos and confusion throughout the state. In Milwaukee  home to 10 percent of the state’s population  the city had sent out tens of thousands of ballots with explicit instructions that explained the new deadline of April 13. So voters who did not tune into the news last Monday night would have had no way of knowing the instructions on their ballots were no longer valid. “You’re talking somewhere around 35 000 to 40 000 people in the city of Milwaukee getting instructions with their ballots that they have until the 13th to return their ballot ” said Neil Albrecht  the executive director of Milwaukee’s election commission. On Friday  four days after the election made national headlines  voters were still coming to the four drop-off bins placed at libraries around the city  casting votes that were clearly now invalid. In Green Bay  the city clerk  Kris Teske  said her office had been planning to work through Wednesday to clear the backlog of hundreds of requests for mail ballots  but the Supreme Court decision basically ended that task; the ballots stayed put. Where much of the legal focus has moved to ballots received after Election Day  there were complications related to ballots received on Election Day itself. The Wisconsin Elections Commission had sent guidance recommending that voters in quarantine wait 24 hours before handing their ballots to witnesses for requisite signatures  to avoid the potential spread of the coronavirus. The absentee ballot of Lisa Schnell  who was self-isolating with her sister and not at her apartment outside Milwaukee  was accidentally sent to her normal residence  where her daughter was still living. Heeding the new deadline set by the lower court  Ms. Schnell asked her daughter to send the ballot to her sister’s house by regular mail. When the Supreme Court knocked down the extension  Ms. Schnell’s ballot was stuck in the mail. And she could not get to a polling station. “If I had known if that was going to happen  I would have had her overnight it to me  or we could have met somewhere in the middle ” she said. “It’s completely crazy.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.)

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/tornado-storm-south.html, us, Dozens Are Killed as Tornadoes and Severe Weather Strike Southern States, The storm carved a destructive path across six states on Sunday and Monday  causing widespread damage and cutting power to tens of thousands of customers., Supported by The storm carved a destructive path across six states on Sunday and Monday  causing widespread damage and cutting power to tens of thousands of customers. By Ellen Ann Fentress and Richard Fausset BASSFIELD  Miss. — Like most Americans  Mamie Harper and her husband had tucked themselves away at home in an effort to keep the coronavirus at bay. On Easter Sunday  they listened to an audio feed of their church service while huddled indoors. But a different kind of trouble soon found them. A tornado — one of dozens that tore across the Southeast this weekend — roared over their street on Sunday afternoon  snapping trees  blowing away keepsakes and launching cars from their parking spots. When it was over  debris temporarily kept emergency medical workers from driving onto Ms. Harper’s block. Her daughter pulled her from the wreckage of her small white house  and soon other neighbors  many of them relatives  also came out to try to help. Ms. Harper  68  felt an odd mix of gratitude and wariness. “You don’t know ” she said Monday  standing on the shoulder of her ruined street in a surgical mask because of the coronavirus. “Even though they’re coming out of the goodness of their heart  they may not know they’ve got it.” The devastating weather system started Sunday and barreled across the region into Monday  leaving destruction  blackouts and heartbreak in its path. More than 30 people died — including at least 11 in Mississippi  nine in South Carolina and eight in Georgia — making it one of the most significant natural disasters in the country since government officials began ordering people to stay home and away from one another in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. The response laid bare the new complications the pandemic may create for neighbors  victims and disaster response officials alike in coming months as a shuttered nation braces for the looming seasons of floods  fires and storms. Emergency agencies are now being forced into new realms of improvisation and creativity as they attempt to provide shelter and succor  while simultaneously minding the presence of a quieter killer. Already  officials are doing what they can to avoid housing evacuees in large shelters  which could prove as dangerous for spreading the coronavirus as any cruise ship. “This is a collision course of conflicting strategies to deal with the natural disasters and the pandemic simultaneously ” said Irwin Redlener  the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. The “bull’s-eye” of the storm system encircled a swath of the South and brought twisters  high winds and intense rain into parts of southern Kentucky  eastern Georgia  Florida  Mississippi  Louisiana and Arkansas  said Katie Martin  a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In Alabama  Gov. Kay Ivey suspended social distancing and other coronavirus-related orders  but only if they might get in the way of an effective response. Though Alabama escaped without any reported fatalities  neighboring Mississippi appeared hardest hit  with at least 11 deaths as of Monday afternoon. The American Red Cross  which runs most of the temporary shelters in the nation  opened a couple of Mississippi sites that attracted dozens of evacuees. But the organization moved all of those people into hotel rooms before Monday morning in an effort to comply with the spirit of social distancing rules  said Trevor Riggen  the Red Cross’s senior vice president of Disaster Cycle Services. In Jones County  in southeast Mississippi  more than 50 people showed up to take shelter in the region’s fortified safe room  built to federal specifications to withstand big storms. Paul Sheffield  the executive director of the county emergency management office  said the evacuees were greeted by volunteers who offered hand sanitizer and insisted they wear masks. They rode out the storm in marked-off areas that kept families about seven and a half feet away from each other. Experts say these efforts  though admirable  may not work in the event of a disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina  in which case there may be no choice but to house people in larger shelters. “The shelter environment is the last thing we want ” Mr. Redlener said. “It’s virtually impossible to sustain social distancing and enforce appropriate public health measures in those circumstances.” Plus  he said  there is the likelihood that many people in shelters would be there without the medications they would need for underlying health conditions. Hurricane season begins June 1  and experts said it may be more active than usual because of warm water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico  Atlantic and Caribbean. That has officials like Shannon Scaff  emergency management director for the coastal city of Charleston  S.C.  particularly stressed. On Monday  Mr. Scaff said coronavirus-related stay-at-home measures have meant his team has been unable to hold community meetings to advise people how to prepare for a hurricane evacuation. And he was still not sure how social distancing might work if an evacuation was large-scale. “Here’s what I know ” he said. “If an evacuation order is given because of a hurricane  Covid or not  I’m telling you to get out of here.” Across the country  emergency officials said that  no matter the circumstance  they would encourage people to adhere to social distancing measures as best they could. Officials in California said they were evaluating how to take into account the virus in responding to wildfires  earthquakes  floods and other disasters that might arise in the coming months. “We’re disaster-prone  so you have to be prepared for multiple things at multiple times ” said Kim Zagaris  a former state fire and rescue chief for the California governor’s Office of Emergency Services  according to The Associated Press. James Kendra  director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware  said he is worried that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  which has been tasked with taking a lead on the pandemic response  could find itself stretched thin if natural disasters pile up. FEMA has struggled with understaffing in recent years  according to a recent article in Insurance Journal  though the agency has contended that it is prepared for the challenges ahead. In a statement Monday  a FEMA spokesperson said that more than 2 900 employees out of 20 500 were supporting the pandemic response  and that it could call in other federal employees to help as part of a “surge capacity force.” Nongovernmental groups are also feeling challenged. Samaritan’s Purse  the North Carolina-based Christian relief group headed by the Rev. Franklin Graham  is planning a vigorous response to the Southeastern storms  sending in crews to help people repair and rebuild homes. On Monday  Mr. Graham said his volunteers would wear masks and gloves and try to abide by social distancing rules as they worked. The problem  for now  was finding enough of them. “There are going to be volunteers who normally would come but may be a little reluctant because of the coronavirus ” he said. The scenes of double crises were commonplace on Monday. Around Chattanooga  Tenn.  where two people died  residents of battered neighborhoods visited home improvement stores in masks and gloves  picking up tarps and plywood to cover up shattered windows and doors. Also hard-hit was Walterboro  S.C.  a historic  moss-draped community of 5 400 residents  about 45 minutes west of Charleston. A tornado tore through the heart of downtown early Monday  dropping trees on two dozen buildings and killing a woman who had been sheltering with her family. The storm also damaged or destroyed better than half of the 52 airplanes at the Lowcountry regional private airport  including a Douglas C-54 that delivered supplies during the Berlin airlift of 1948-49. At the Colleton Courtyard assisted living facility downtown  Maxwell Lockwood  its manager  said he was thankful the tornado had not done much damage. And that none of the 34 residents of the home  he said  have tested positive for the virus. Ellen Ann Fentress reported from Bassfield  Miss.  and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/business/economy/coronavirus-oil-opec-trump.html, business economy, The Big Deal to Cut Oil Production May Not Be Big Enough, Saudi Arabia  Russia and other oil-producing nations have pledged to cut about 10 percent of global production  but demand is down by much more than that., Supported by Saudi Arabia  Russia and other oil-producing nations have pledged to cut about 10 percent of global production  but demand is down by much more than that. By Clifford Krauss HOUSTON — The agreement by major oil producers on Sunday to reduce their daily production by 9.7 million barrels was the largest cutback in history and a feat of remarkable coordination by more than 20 nations led by Saudi Arabia and Russia with unusual mediation from the United States. But it probably still won’t be enough. Demand for oil has tumbled in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has crippled global commerce and eliminated untold numbers of commutes  plane trips and cargo shipments. Experts estimate that demand has fallen by somewhere between 25 million barrels and 35 million barrels a day — or up to three and a half times as much as what the oil nations are promising to cut. News of the deal briefly lifted oil prices on Monday  but those gains faded over the course of the day. The U.S. oil price benchmark ended the day at $22.41  or less than half of where it was at the start of the year. Had the group of oil-producing nations  known as OPEC Plus  not reached a deal  oil prices would have collapsed  industry experts said. Leaders of the American oil industry  which is responsible directly and indirectly for roughly 10 million jobs  welcomed the deal and President Trump’s role in mediating a halt to a Saudi-Russian price war. But even they acknowledged that it would not end their financial difficulties. “The problem is the demand is still not there ” said Kirk Edwards  chief executive of Latigo Petroleum  a Texas producer. “Even with these cuts there will be a tremendous amount of oversupply on the market  and that’s why you haven’t seen the oil prices dramatically increase.” Mr. Edwards predicted that 40 000 workers would be laid off in the West Texas Permian Basin alone. “There is no reason to drill or complete any more wells this year because there is nowhere to take the production ” he added. Dozens of small independent oil producers are on the brink of bankruptcy  and the deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies probably will not save them. A few oil company stocks  which have been sliding for months  rose on Monday  but most  including the largest American oil company  Exxon Mobil  were down. Few American oil companies can eke out profits at current prices. Shale oil wells in Texas and North Dakota typically make money only when oil prices are above $40 a barrel  which is why the industry is rapidly decommissioning rigs and fracking equipment and laying off thousands of workers. “Low prices will still need to do the work of forcing production cuts in many parts of the world  including the U.S. shale patch ” said Jason Bordoff  director of the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Eventually low prices could also spur demand  but probably not until the coronavirus epidemic has been brought under control. Even as the United States  Canada  Brazil and Norway — countries that were not party to the OPEC Plus deal — independently cut their production  storage facilities and tankers are filling up fast. And experts point out that even the 9.7 million barrels OPEC Plus countries agreed to cut daily won’t take effect until May 1  almost three weeks from now. By then  most European refineries will have run out of storage space. “The demand implosion is immediate and deep  while the supply decline will likely happen in stages ” said Francisco Blanch  head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America. “Plenty of downside risks remain.” One big risk is that the countries that made the deal  cutting 23 percent of their production  won’t abide by it because OPEC countries have been known to cheat. Several members of the oil cartel surpassed their production quotas as recently as last month  according to S&P Global Platts  a division of the credit ratings firm. “History indicates large  credible cuts can be expected from Saudi  Russia  the U.A.E. and Kuwait ” said Paul Sheldon  a political analyst at S&P Global Platts  referring to the United Arab Emirates. “But compliance with 23 percent reductions elsewhere will be challenging.” After the production cut agreement was reached on Sunday  Saudi Aramco slashed its petroleum selling prices for the second month in a row. That move did not violate the agreement  but made clear that Saudi Arabia’s national oil company would defend its market share. Still while the agreement makes the sharpest cuts in May and June  it pledges to keep production lower through April 2022 in an acknowledgment that demand will not snap back. The oil industry’s prospects will most likely be linked to how the pandemic evolves — something few experts can predict with certainty. “How cyclical is Covid?” asked Paul Sankey  managing director of Mizuho Securities in New York. “Is demand for oil structurally impaired by a future world of face masks? Keep in mind that demand collapse has only really been a monthlong effect so far.” Oil-producing countries across the Middle East  Africa and Latin America are bound to face not only economic difficulties  but possibly political turbulence as governments are forced to cut social programs and energy subsidies. Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify its economy  for example  could be in jeopardy because the country is earning a lot less from oil exports. In the United States  the slump in oil demand and production could depress the economies of states like Texas  Oklahoma  North Dakota and Alaska  especially in rural areas that depend on oil. Restaurants and hotels have already emptied in some areas that have not seen many coronavirus infections  but where drilling activity has effectively stopped. Still  the OPEC Plus pact has helped established a floor under oil prices  at least for now  which might have saved some American oil business  said Roger Diwan  a vice president at IHS Markit  an energy research and consulting firm. “This is critically needed relief ” he said. “The direct involvement of President Trump to forge this historical deal is the most unusual aspect of it and reflects his visible concern for U.S. shale producers.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/business/13virus-oil2/merlin_171419508_3bfb34ff-d3f0-46fa-8255-c3946025efd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/multimedia/author-clifford-krauss/author-clifford-krauss-thumbLarge.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/science/robert-barth-dead.html, science, Robert Barth  a Pioneer of Deep-Sea Diving  Dies at 89, Mr. Barth was the sole “aquanaut” to play a major role in all four stages of the Navy’s landmark program to open the depths to long-term habitation., Supported by Mr. Barth was the sole “aquanaut” to play a major role in all four stages of the Navy’s landmark program to open the depths to long-term habitation. By John Schwartz The hatch would not open. Six hundred feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast  Chief Warrant Officer Bob Barth struggled to get inside the Navy’s new Sealab 3 habitat. The 340-ton undersea platform  where he and a nine-man crew were scheduled to spend 12 days together  was leaking  and Mr. Barth and a fellow diver  Berry L. Cannon  had headed down with two other divers to fix it. Suddenly  Mr. Barth realized that Mr. Cannon was having convulsions  that his respirator had floated free and that his jaws were clenched shut so that it could not be reinserted. The scene played out on the closed-circuit television monitoring the habitat from the surface; Mr. Barth frantically tried to get his crewmate back to the diving pod  where the other two divers waited. One of them  Richard Blackburn  helped wrestle Mr. Cannon back into the capsule for the slow return to the surface. As they rose  they tried to resuscitate Mr. Cannon  but without luck; using their intercom  they called to the surface to say he had died. Mr. Cannon’s death marked the end of one of the great programs of naval exploration  one that had begun with a dry-land test called Genesis and had moved through three versions of the Sealab underwater habitat  from the late 1950s to 1969. The program greatly increased the depths at which humans could safely live and work. The divers were called aquanauts  an under-the-sea analogue to the glamorous astronauts who circled the earth and landed on the moon. Only one aquanaut was deeply involved in all four stages of that grand adventure: Mr. Barth  who died on March 26 at his home in Panama City  Fla.  at 89. The cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease  his son  Dale  said. The dangerous experiments Mr. Barth took part in paved the way for exploits of deepwater espionage  undersea construction and demolition projects around the world. He never achieved conventional fame  but he was the “ultimate aquanaut ” said Leslie Leaney  the executive director of the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame. “His contributions benefited the world of science and national security  but also the economies of all nations that explored for offshore oil.” In 2010  the Navy named its aquatic training facility in Panama City for Mr. Barth. “Nothing that Navy divers do is one guy ” he said at the dedication. “There is always a whole bunch of people involved in it.” The comparison between aquanauts and astronauts was apt  said Ben Hellwarth  a journalist and the author of “Sealab: America’s Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor.” “Much like the first NASA astronauts of the U.S. space program  Bob Barth volunteered to put himself on the line to do something extraordinary that had never been done ” Mr. Hellwarth said  “and not everyone in the Navy thought it was such a good idea.” Mr. Barth would say: “Some people called us guinea pigs. They called us a lot of other things  too ” a suggestion that skeptics thought anyone involved in the program was stupid  crazy or both. Many Navy higher-ups doubted that the program could lead to anything useful  Mr. Hellwarth said. The Sealab program got its start with Capt. George F. Bond  then head of the Medical Research Laboratory at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton  Conn. Mr. Barth was stationed there. The concept that Captain Bond developed was “saturation diving ” which involves putting divers under high atmospheric pressure before descent and bringing them back to normal very gradually. Under the pressures of diving  atmospheric gases get forced into the bloodstream and bodily tissues. Come up too fast  and the gases bubble out  like the fizz of a carbonated soda when you pop the lid. Without careful decompression  escaping gas can cause the potentially fatal condition known as the bends. The best mixture of gases for such excursions had to be determined. Under high pressure  too much oxygen becomes toxic. Too much nitrogen can have a narcotic effect. The experiments led to gas mixtures that  for great depths  were composed largely of helium  which made the divers’ voices high-pitched and squeaky. Helium also transfers heat more quickly than nitrogen and oxygen do  which meant that deep-sea work could expose the divers to bone-chilling cold. Levels of carbon dioxide had to be carefully managed; Mr. Cannon was poisoned by too much carbon dioxide  and it was later discovered that a crucial canister  which was supposed to be filled with a chemical that absorbed the CO2 in recirculated air  had been empty. Mr. Barth possessed a natural authority  his former teammate Mr. Blackburn recalled. “He would lead from the front ” he said  meaning that he would be the first to take any risk that was expected of his crew. Mr. Barth could be profane and direct. “You didn’t want to get on the wrong side of him on a bad day ” Mr. Blackburn said  but added that “he always had some kind of prank up his sleeve.” Friends referred to him as “Sweet Old Bob ” with the abbreviation intentional. Robert August Barth Jr. was born in Manila on Aug. 28  1930  to Robert Sr. and Phyllis (Ludwig) Barth. His father was an Army officer on the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur; his mother managed a shoe store. They divorced when he was 10. According to biographical information provided by Mr. Hellwarth  with the coming of the World War II Mr. Barth’s mother and her second husband stayed behind in Manila while young Bob was put on a ship to the United States  where he rejoined his father. He was later reunited with his mother and stepfather  and they moved to Chicago  and later South Africa. At 17  Mr. Barth took a job as a seaman on a cargo ship bound from South Africa for Baltimore; once in the United States  he signed on with the Navy  where he encountered Captain Bond. He married Georgia Murrow in 1951  and they had a son  Bobby  who became a rock musician. They divorced in 1954. In 1958  he married Joyce Ann Williams and adopted Dale  her son by her first marriage; the couple had a second child  Samuel  and later divorced. In 2014 he married Sharon Kay Kinsey. She survives him  as do his sons. After retiring from the Navy  Mr. Barth worked in commercial diving and later took a Civil Service position with the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. In 2000 he published a memoir  “Sea Dwellers.” The Sealab program included one real-life astronaut  Scott Carpenter  one of the original seven Mercury astronauts and the second American to orbit the earth. His daughter  Kris Stoever  said that he and Mr. Barth had “formed a fast friendship.” Mr. Carpenter  who died in 2013  wrote the foreword to “Sea Dwellers.” Ms. Stoever’s brothers got a taste of the kinds of pranks that Mr. Barth could pull. One summer Mr. Barth was visiting the Carpenter family vacation home at Palmer Lake in Colorado  south of Denver  and Mr. Carpenter was trying  without success  to interest two of his children  Matthew and Nick  both in their preteens  in the maritime art of tying knots. “The boys didn’t want to do it ” Ms. Stoever said. “Bob Barth tied them to a tree.” Matthew  in retrospect  finds it funny  Ms. Stoever said; Nick does not. Neither could recall the knots Mr. Barth employed.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/arts/television/craig-gilbert-dead.html, arts television, Craig Gilbert  94  Dies; Created Groundbreaking ‘American Family’, Airing in 1973 and making national stars out of the Loud family  it is now considered the first reality TV show. It had people buzzing then  and fighting., Supported by Airing in 1973 and making national stars out of the Loud family  it is now considered the first reality TV show. It had people buzzing then  and fighting. By William Yardley Craig Gilbert  who created what is widely considered to have been the first reality television show  “An American Family ” in 1973 and then all but disappeared from public view amid a storm of criticism and lasting  bitter disputes among its participants  died on Friday at his home in Lower Manhattan. He was 94. John Mulholland  a longtime friend and co-worker  confirmed the death. Mr. Gilbert spent most of his final decades living alone in a small apartment on Jane Street  relying on money he had inherited from his parents. “An American Family” was the last film he made. But in the early 1970s he was the envy of many documentarians  having produced well-received films about the anthropologist Margaret Mead and the disabled Irish writer Christy Brown. He was a producer at WNET  the New York public television outlet  when he came up with an even more ambitious idea  at a time when narrative journalism was on the rise: to follow a real American family for months  capturing moments mundane and emotional in an unvarnished  unrehearsed style known as cinéma vérité. He then persuaded WNET to finance the project with $1.2 million (about $7.6 million in today’s money)  and set about seeking an appropriate family for the venture. “It was not hard to find people who wanted to do it — people jumped at the opportunity ” he said in an interview for this obituary in 2013. “But I wanted a family that was very  very middle-class and had a wide spread of kids — as wide a spread of children in age as possible.” An editor of the women’s section at The Santa Barbara News-Press introduced him to the Louds — Bill  Pat and their five children  Lance  Kevin  Grant  Delilah and Michele. “I met the family on a Thursday ” Mr. Gilbert said. “They agreed to do it on Sunday. I flew back to New York on Monday  and a week later we started shooting. I knew nothing except that they were an attractive couple with four attractive kids — or four kids that I knew and one I didn’t know.” Mrs. Loud  too  recalled making a quick decision. “We asked the kids  and they all agreed ” she said  also in a 2013 interview for this obituary. “It seemed like a fun thing to do.” Yet in 300 hours of filming over seven months in 1971  the cameras recorded scenes that startled viewers when the program was broadcast nearly two years later as a 12-part series. The son Mr. Gilbert said he had not met  Lance  the eldest child  was revealed to be gay. (Mr. Gilbert said he did not know Lance was gay when he chose the Louds.) Bill Loud was filmed discussing his belief that family life in America denied men the independence they deserved. In one memorable scene  Bill and Pat had a drunken argument in a favorite Mexican restaurant. In another  she coolly told him to move out after he had returned from a business trip. What happened off camera has been in dispute since the show aired. Mr. and Mrs. Loud have both said that their marriage was troubled before the filming  but some people involved in the show later accused Mr. Gilbert of enabling their breakup after he learned of the tension  with the goal of generating compelling footage. “Craig decides at that point that he’s going to sort of schmooze her incessantly to make some kind of decision about this situation ” Alan Raymond  who  with his wife  Susan  did the filming and sound recording for the program  said in an interview for this obituary. In one extended scene  Pat Loud complained to her brother and sister-in-law about infidelities that she said Bill had committed. Mrs. Loud told The New York Times that she had been “coerced” into doing the scene on camera. Mr. Gilbert strongly disagreed. “I said  ‘Pat  we must shoot that ’” he recalled in the 2013 interview. “She said  ‘I do not want you to.’ I said  ‘We must  Pat  because otherwise it’s going to come out of the blue. No one will understand it.’ “She finally agreed  and her brother and sister-in-law were in the room when she agreed to it. And now she says she was coerced.” Mr. Gilbert and the Raymonds  who had worked together on the film about Christy Brown  stopped speaking to one another after “An American Family” was broadcast. The Raymonds claimed that they should have been credited as directors. Mr. Gilbert said that the nature of the program meant that it had no director. He accused the Raymonds of undercutting the project by refusing to film painful realities of the Louds’ relationship  including portions of the argument in the Mexican restaurant. Most news media coverage was negative. The Louds appeared on the cover of Newsweek magazine with the headline “The Broken Family.” The family complained that Mr. Gilbert had edited the series to titillate and dwell on negative elements. “We were California airheads as far as they were concerned ” Mrs. Loud said in 2013  referring to the press coverage. Mr. Gilbert defended his work even before it was criticized. “This was a cooperative venture in every sense of the word ” he said in the opening of the first episode. But even as Mr. Gilbert stood by his work  he also appeared distraught by the criticism. “As its producer  I was accused of being a Svengali-like manipulator ” he wrote in 1982  “a crass invader of privacy  and a brooding East Coast neurotic with a compelling need to foist my twisted vision of life on an unsuspecting public.” He added: “I retreated from life. I told myself this retreat would be temporary; I would lick my wounds  regroup  and come out fighting. But of course that didn’t happen.” Craig P. Gilbert was born on Aug. 13  1925  in Manhattan. His father  Francis  was a musical copyright lawyer whose clients included Irving Berlin and Frank Loesser. His mother  Minna  was a homemaker. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover  Mass.  in 1943  before joining the American Red Cross. Mr. Gilbert was working with the American Red Cross while they aided the British army in liberating the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. After returning from the war he enrolled in Harvard and graduated in 1949. Mr. Gilbert left no immediate survivors. He separated from his wife  Suzanne (Stater) Gilbert  shortly before shooting began for “An American Family ” and they remained separated  though they never divorced. She died in 2005. After college Mr. Gilbert variously worked as a gopher on Broadway  as a journalist  as a freelance television script writer and as a film editor and producer. By the mid-1960s he had found a full-time position writing and producing for WNET. He became an executive producer in 1966. His documentary film “Margaret Mead’s New Guinea Journal ” about the anthropologist’s return to the village of Peri 40 years after she had first studied it  was broadcast in 1968. His film “The Triumph of Christy Brown” aired in 1970. Daniel Day-Lewis  in researching his Oscar-winning role as Mr. Brown for the 1989 movie “My Left Foot ” studied the Gilbert film and met with Mr. Gilbert. In the decades after “An American Family ” the Louds and the Raymonds were involved in a follow-up program and an anniversary compilation that was released on DVD. The Raymonds were also consultants for “Cinema Verite ” a 2011 HBO film based on the making of “An American Family.” The film  which starred James Gandolfini as Mr. Gilbert  suggested that Mr. Gilbert and Mrs. Loud had an affair during the filming  perpetuating a rumor that both repeatedly denied. “I never touched the woman ” Mr. Gilbert said in his 2013 interview with The Times  noting that he had emphasized this during numerous meetings with Mr. Gandolfini before the movie was shot. Both the Louds and Mr. Gilbert hired lawyers to complain about the film  and the Louds reached a financial settlement with HBO. Mr. Gilbert said he had decided not to pursue the matter. Perhaps the most surprising development in the years after the show aired is that Bill and Pat Loud resumed living together. Lance Loud died at 50 in 2001  and one of his dying wishes was that his parents would reunite. The Louds did not remarry. Bill Loud died in 2018 at 97. “An American Family” had plenty of fans when it aired  and the Louds and Mr. Gilbert both received letters from people who said that the events in the show resembled struggles in their own families. Ms. Mead  the anthropologist  was among those who attended an early screening  and she liked what she saw. “It’s an extraordinary series ” she wrote to Mr. Gilbert. “Nothing like it has ever been done  and I think it may be as important for our time as were the invention of the drama and the novel for earlier generations — a new way for people to understand themselves.” But even as many people say his work helped inspire a new culture of exposure  Mr. Gilbert became reclusive. In 2013  he was harshly critical of the current genre of reality television. “That is not reality television ” he said. “What they’re doing is they’re using real people  but they’re scripting the shows. Reality television is basically cheap television. ‘An American Family’ was the honest-to-God reality. I didn’t script a thing. I didn’t do anything. I didn’t negotiate anything. I didn’t manipulate anything.” Julia Carmel contributed reporting.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/arts/television/sesame-street-virus.html, arts television, How to Get to ‘Sesame Street’? These Days  It’s by Video Conference, As children stay home and viewing-time restrictions are abandoned  creators of child-focused content are taking on the coronavirus and the changes it has wrought for families., Supported by As children stay home and viewing-time restrictions are abandoned  creators of child-focused content are taking on the coronavirus and the changes it has wrought for families. By Melena Ryzik On a rainy afternoon recently  Ernie the Muppet was trying to get through to his roommate Bert. Normally they would be together  side-by-orange-and-yellow-side. Not these days. Peter Linz  the puppeteer who plays Ernie  the gleeful “Sesame Street” character  was in his small home office in Westchester County  N.Y.  with the Muppet hoisted on his arm. He wore a headband with a mic around his forehead  and he peered into an ad hoc monitor set up on a music stand. Perched on a puppeteer’s dolly three feet off the ground  he called to his teenage son to be quiet before he hit record. He did Ernie’s tee-hee giggle. Watching from a dozen screens around the country  a director  editor  producers  curriculum experts and other colleagues were all working at a distance — and furiously fast. The newest “Sesame Street” special  “Elmo’s Playdate ” was taking shape. Debuting Tuesday  the special will feature Elmo having a virtual meet-up with his Muppet pals and celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anne Hathaway. “If Fallon and Colbert can do it  so can Elmo ” said Ben Lehmann  executive producer of “Sesame.” As the Covid-19 crisis keeps billions around the world cocooned in their homes  children’s programming has been a salve — and a brief flare of sanity — for desperate caregivers. Screen time limits are fully out the window. When Disney Plus said it would release “Frozen 2” early  at the outset of the pandemic in the United States  the parental relief was almost palpable. Now  shows  channels and performers with a social message are starting to create content about the coronavirus  and the changes it has wrought for families. Aside from news and late-night comedy  kids TV is just about the only live-action genre in production for broadcast right now. But self-taping with a puppet occupying (at least) one arm requires more than just dexterity. “There are so many moving parts ” said Linz. “In the studio  you have a person who’s responsible for each one of those moving parts.” At home  he did the camera  lights  sound and Muppet maintenance; he also had to find a spot that could convincingly double for Bert and Ernie’s apartment and position himself in such a way that Eric Jacobson  who plays Bert  could be edited into his frame later  from his own home shoot in Fairfield  Conn. They also realized that their smartphones were streaming video with a nearly one-second delay — enough to kill a Muppet joke riff. “What we learned is  we have to jump on the end of each other’s lines ” Linz said. In a knock-knock joke  “I have to say ‘Who’s there?’ before the end of the second knock.” What might have taken an afternoon at the Sesame studios in Queens took days to shoot remotely. “It was a lot of work!” Lehmann  the producer  wrote in an email  as the special was being finished. “But everyone leaned into it. It’s the way Sesame Workshop has always responded to the most pressing needs of kids. We try to evolve as they do.” The demand is apparent. Downloads of the PBS Kids video and game apps have increased 80 percent in the last three weeks — almost a million new downloads  said Lesli Rotenberg  chief programming executive and general manager of children’s media and education at PBS. Streaming is up  too: In March  “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood ” an animated spinoff of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” for the hard-to-corral preschool set  had 56.4 million streams  a spokeswoman said  up 15 percent from the previous month. And about 70 000 people have signed up in the past month for a daily newsletter from PBS with tips for navigating the new normal. “We’re thinking about it sort of in a Mister Rogers way  just in terms of preparing kids for what they’re going to see ” Rotenberg said. As Chris Loggins  supervising producer for “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood ” put it  they are following one of Fred Rogers’s guiding principles: “He would say  ‘What’s mentionable is manageable.’” The enormity of the social and economic changes means educational TV is shifting into overdrive to explain them. In the United States  “Elmo” will be simulcast in prime-time on Tuesday on PBSKids  HBO and all other WarnerMedia networks — a first for WarnerMedia. (The special will also air globally starting Wednesday  part of a larger Covid response effort; resources for families and providers can be found at www.sesamestreet.org/caring.) Nickelodeon  which last month launched #KidsTogether  an initiative to provide resources for home entertainment and learning  hosted a town hall to answer kids’ questions. An economics professor even weighed in about the safety of the supply chain. (Butts will be covered  she assured — no TP shortages.) Next up is a special on Noggin  a Nick offshoot  to help parents cope  too. Many programs already had material that could be repurposed — about fighting germs  for example  or coping when routines are upended. “Daniel Tiger” resurfaced clips about both. “The harder work is putting our heads together and figuring out what to create for this moment ” said Rotenberg. In mid-March  PBS convened “a SWAT team ” she said. One result was a series of public service announcements from “Odd Squad ” a live-action show about kid special agents who solve problems. Now they also demonstrate good sneeze hygiene. “Daniel Tiger ” whose short songs about behavior soundtrack many toddler lives  has had parents publicly pleading for a dedicated coronavirus show. The team is working on it. But as Loggins noted  a single episode can take 40 weeks to make  produced from multiple cities. Child development experts  some of whom worked with Mister Rogers  weigh in on a granular level. “Those little tunes are crafted down to the punctuation ” Loggins said. On other platforms  messaging has already evolved in the month since the United States began its shutdown. SpongeBob has been deployed to help explain basics like how to wash your hands. The Australian musical act the Wiggles created a bop about social distancing. “This phrase is pretty abstract for children ” said Emma Watkins  better known as Emma the yellow Wiggle. “We thought  we have to put it in a song and use it in a way to empower children.” Their popular spin — the video earned nearly a half-million views in two weeks — frames quarantining as a heroic move  with lyrics like  “We’re staying at home to keep nana safe.” Children’s entertainers also heard a lot of anxiety around birthdays. “‘Will I still turn 4 if I don’t have a party on the weekend?’ — that seemed to be the main issue for children ” Watkins said. (Response songs are coming.) For performers  there’s anxiety  too. The Wiggles normally tour eight or nine months a year. Now the foursome are grounded  “isolated together ” Watkins said. They shot their social distancing song in their own studio with just a camera operator  keeping a wide berth. They host daily live shows from their homes in Sydney. “It is about being creative and seeing how we can help ” Watkins said. Sesame Workshop also sprang into action. In mid-March  as their offices closed and the scope of what was to come became apparent  they packed up tripods for phones and other gear  sanitized the Muppets and shipped them to performers. Ernie arrived at Linz’s home still damp. “I unwrapped him right away  and I let him sit for several days ” for safety  said Linz  who has played Ernie since 2017 and worked with “Sesame Street” since 1991. On the rainy day shoot  a week and a half before the special was to air  Linz got advice from an editor about how to lock in focus — he was shooting on an iPhone but not on its native camera app. With Ernie aloft — “Jim Henson said  we’re acting from the elbow up” — he had his phone mirrored to his Apple TV and another small monitor set up to better view the puppet. He fluffed Ernie’s hair between takes. (The muppets came complete with an emergency repair kit and  of course  a rubber ducky for Ernie.) They were shooting a goodbye moment; as Ernie gesticulated  Matt Vogel  the director  reminded Linz not to have Ernie touch his face. It was one of many signs of the bizarre circumstances. (Another was that Ernie was Bert-less: Typically  Linz said  if the characters are in a scene together  they shoot together.) As weird and challenging as this Sesame episode was  it felt like the right thing to do  its creators said. “It’s so incredibly meaningful to be involved in a project that you know is going to bring joy to potentially millions of people ” Linz said. “It definitely brought a sense of normalcy to my day — in fact  it affected me for the rest of the day  I was in a very good mood. It was comforting to do something normal in a very abnormal time.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/arts/13virus-sesame1/13virus-sesame1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-melena-ryzik/author-melena-ryzik-thumbLarge.png 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/arts/design/rolling-stones-logo-anniversary.html, arts design, How the ‘Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World’ Got Its Logo, On the 50th anniversary of his famous “tongue and lips” emblem for the Rolling Stones  John Pasche says he had no expectations it would become so famous  or lucrative., Supported by On the 50th anniversary of his famous “tongue and lips” emblem for the Rolling Stones  John Pasche says he had no expectations it would become so famous  or lucrative. By Joobin Bekhrad It began life as a tiny emblem  something to adorn a 45 r.p.m. single or the band’s letterhead. It quickly became ubiquitous and  ultimately  the most famous logo in rock ’n’ roll. Over 50 years  the legendary “tongue and lips” of the Rolling Stones has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts and lighters to stage sets  appearing in countless variations throughout the decades. And while many who love it are fans of the band  the logo has in many ways transcended the Stones. But when it was commissioned in April 1970 its designer  John Pasche  had little idea how popular — and lucrative — it would become. The logo was to be displayed later this month in “Revolutions: Records and Rebels 1966 — 1970 ” an exhibition at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris that has been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. But I caught up with Pasche  74  in London by telephone last week  for a glimpse into its back story. (I included other witnesses to its history  as well.) Early in 1970  the Royal College of Art in London was contacted by the Rolling Stones’ head office. The band was looking for an artist to create a poster for its 1970 European tour. The art school recommended Pasche  a Master of Arts student in his final year. Pasche met with Mick Jagger to discuss ideas for the poster  and returned to the frontman with a design a week later. Jagger was not satisfied. ‘‘I think it was possibly to do with the color and composition ” Pasche told the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2016. “He turned it down ” Pasche recalled with a laugh. “I thought  That was that  then. ” But Jagger said  “I’m sure you can do better  John.”’ The second and final version  which harked back to the aesthetics of the ’30s and ’40s but also included a Concorde turbojet  was more pleasing. Pasche was contacted shortly after by Jo Bergman  the band’s personal assistant. This time  in a letter dated April 29  1970  Bergman specifically asked Pasche ‘‘to create a logo or symbol which may be used on note paper  as a programme cover and as a cover for the press book.” In a meeting with the designer some months later  Jagger was more specific  Pasche recalled: He wanted “an image that could work on its own … like the Shell Petroleum logo. He wanted that kind of simplicity.” During the same meeting Jagger showed Pasche an illustration of the Hindu deity Kali  which Jagger had seen in a shop near his home and asked if he could borrow. Jagger  according to Pasche  said he was ‘‘more interested in the Indian nature of it ” Indian culture in Britain being quite trendy. But the designer was struck by Kali’s open mouth and protruding tongue. ‘‘I just immediately picked up on the tongue and mouth ” Pasche said. Contrary to popular belief  the logo  originally created in black and white and used to create subsequent versions  was not — at least intentionally — intended to represent Jagger’s tongue and lips. “I said  Surely those were Mick Jagger’s lips!”’ recalled Victoria Broackes  a senior curator at the V&A Museum  who in 2008 bought the original logo design online from an auction house in Chicago on behalf of the V&A. Pasche  she said  “looked rather nonplused and said  ‘Well  maybe subliminally  but no.’” Pasche contends his logo was also intended to be a protest symbol. “It’s the kind of thing kids do when they stick their tongue out at you ” he said. “That was the main reason I thought it would work well.” The logo was executed quickly toward the end of 1970. The release of the band’s classic “Sticky Fingers” album in April 1971 marked its first public appearance. It was used on the back cover  on the label and  most prominently  on the insert. However an alternate version of the logo was used for the United States release — “slightly modified by Craig Braun ” said Andrew Blauvelt  curator-at-large for design at the Museum of Arts and Design in Manhattan. At the time  Braun was working with Andy Warhol to realize Warhol’s idea of a working zipper on the album’s cover. Pasche says that Braun modified the design not because it was lacking in any respect but because it had been faxed to the United States in a rush. The fax “was very grainy and gray” — and the logo  Pasche admitted  “needed redrawing.” It is Braun’s elongated version  with extra lines and highlights  that continues to be used officially. In Pete Fornatale’s book “50 Licks: Myths and Stories from Half a Century of the Rolling Stones ” Braun said that he had been given Pasche’s logo by Marshall Chess  the president of Rolling Stones Records  and “basically outlined the highlights  the lips  and the tongue.” (Braun and Warhol were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1972 for best recording package for “Sticky Fingers” but lost to Gene Brownell and Dean O. Torrence’s cover design for Pollution  depicting a chick in gas mask emerging from its shell.) And Pasche’s logo continues to be attributed to others. ‘‘A lot of people think Andy Warhol designed it ” Broackes said  “which of course he didn’t.” She believes it was because Warhol was credited for the rest of the artwork on “Sticky Fingers.” According to Blake Gopnik  author of “Warhol: A Life as Art ” a new biography  the tongue and lips “could absolutely not be by Andy Warhol.” “It has nothing to do with the look of his art " he said  “especially the conceptual framework that he always worked in.” Why the longstanding confusion? ‘Warhol’s like a giant cultural magnet ” Gopnik said. “Everything adheres to him. And he made no attempt to clarify matters.” He added  “He preferred factual confusion to clarity  so the idea that he be credited with the logo would have been something that he would have absolutely encouraged.’’ The logo has generated an enormous amount of money for the Stones. The British public relations veteran Alan Edwards  who handled the band’s publicity in the ’80s  said the Stones “must have grossed a good billion [pounds] in concerts  record and DVD sales  merchandising and exhibitions” and also used the logo “all over advertising.” Samuel O’Toole  an intellectual property lawyer at Briffa Legal in London  estimated the figure to be “hundreds of millions of pounds.” Pasche said he was paid just £50 in 1970 (about $970 today)  and also received a £200 bonus. It was only in 1976  when an official contract was drawn up between himself and Musidor B.V.  the band’s Netherlands-based law firm  that the designer began receiving royalties for his work. Pasche remembers his share as 10 percent of net income on sales of merchandising displaying the logo. He estimates he made “a few thousand pounds” in total in royalties until 1982  when he sold his copyright to the band for £26 000. Pasche chuckles when he says  ‘‘I’d probably be living in a castle now” had he retained his copyright but say the decision was forced by a gray area in copyright law at the time regarding usage rights — if a company had been using something for a number of years and it was recognized as part of the company  it could try to assume copyright. His lawyer told Pasche he could lose in court  so they negotiated a fee. O’Toole said Pasche’s lawyer was right to take that road. ‘‘There’s a good argument ” he said  that the Rolling Stones could have argued that they had “an implied license to make use of the copyrighted work.” Had Pasche fought and lost  he would have been “liable for his own legal fees  and also the legal fees of the Stones  which are probably going to be humongous.” “It’s almost like David and Goliath  really ” he added. “The one designer up against the Rolling Stones.” Pasche’s original design can today be seen at the V&A (which has historical ties to the Royal College of Art). Broackes said: ‘‘The fact that it was physically designed on the premises and came back to us was in itself a remarkable thing. It’s a star object in a sense for that  not just because it’s the most well-known logo.” Pasche’s ‘‘original and singular design ” as Blauvelt describes it  has come a long way  despite having been done in a low-key fashion and at low cost. “And with so little expectation for it ” adds Broackes. “It sums up the Rolling Stones themselves — the anti-authoritarianism  the devil-may-care attitude” — and  of course  “the sex appeal.” But she also pointed to its adaptability as a major reason for its massive success. ‘‘It’s been reworked in so many different ways ” Broackes marveled. “There aren’t many logos that can be tiny and on a 45 but also be a stage set. That’s pretty amazing.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/arts/13stones-logo1/13stones-logo1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Could It Happen Again?, , A trip to the moon later this decade should be safer  but it won’t be safe. The damaged service module of the Apollo 13 mission  floating away after the astronauts jettisoned it before re-entry back to Earth.Credit...NASA Supported by By Kenneth Chang Apollo 13 almost killed three NASA astronauts. Will it be safer the next time people head to the moon  more than 50 years later? “Safer  yes ” said Douglas O. Stanley  president and executive director of the National Institute of Aerospace  a nonprofit research institute in Hampton  Va. “We have more reliable systems now.” Think of the half-century of advances in other modes of transportation. New cars are chock-full of anti-lock brakes  airbags  automatic emergency braking and backup cameras — innovations that were lacking in cars on the roads in 1970. Safety systems now automatically apply the brakes if a train is going too fast around a curve. Jetliner crashes are much rarer  even as the number of flights has multiplied. Rockets and spacecraft are also becoming much more sophisticated. “The parts are more reliable ” Dr. Stanley said. “Rocket engines are more reliable than in the ’60s.” That means the next trip to the moon  anticipated later in the 2020s  should be safer — but not safe. “Spaceflight  you’re operating in a pretty difficult environment ” said Gene Kranz  the flight director who was in charge in mission control on the night of April 13  1970  when Apollo 13 went awry. The mission had launched two days earlier  and the three astronauts aboard — James A. Lovell Jr.  Fred W. Haise Jr. and John L. Swigert Jr. — were already 200 000 miles from Earth  well on the way to being the fifth American crew to reach the moon. Just after 10 p.m.  mission control asked Mr. Swigert  the pilot of the command module that was to orbit the moon  to perform a “cryo stir ” a routine task to briefly whisk ultracold hydrogen and oxygen in the propellant tanks. That prevented the propellants from separating into layers  which causes misleading pressure readings. He did. The spacecraft shook. Warning lights lit up. “I believe we’ve had a problem here ” Mr. Swigert reported. It was not immediately clear how serious the problem was. “For the first minutes  I thought  ‘This is a minor electrical problem ’” Mr. Kranz recalled. “We’ll put the crew to sleep and work it. Then another controller said the crew reported a pretty big bang.” Surviving disaster  in the astronauts’ words and photographs. Unknown to anyone at the time  wires inside one of the oxygen tanks in the service module — the part of the spacecraft that provided propulsion and electrical power — were damaged. When Mr. Swigert flipped the switch  that generated a spark that ignited the wires’ insulation  and the tank ruptured  emptying its contents into space. The other oxygen tank  damaged  was also leaking. The oxygen was not just for the astronauts to breathe  but also fed the fuel cells that powered the spacecraft. The command module was dying  quickly. But the lunar lander  docked to the command module  was intact. Under the direction of Glynn Lunney  the flight director whose shift followed Mr. Kranz’s  the Apollo 13 astronauts scrambled into the lunar module  which served as their lifeboat. Engineers on the ground were able to solve a series of critical problems  like how to jury rig filters from the command module to work in the lander’s carbon dioxide removal system to prevent the gas from building up to levels deadly to the astronauts. The engineers also calculated an engine burn by the lunar module to get Apollo 13 on a trajectory back to Earth  and figured out how to restart the command module with the limited power available. Eighty-seven hours after the explosion  the Apollo 13 astronauts safely splashed in the Pacific Ocean. “I had a lot of confidence ” Mr. Kranz said. “Every time I launched  I believed we would bring them home. It was a confidence.” But luck also played a role. If the explosion had occurred later in the mission  after the lunar lander with Mr. Lovell and Mr. Haise had already headed to the moon  the separated command module with Mr. Swigert would have been stranded in lunar orbit. Mr. Lovell and Mr. Haise would have been stuck on the moon’s surface with no way home. That was not the only close call of the Apollo era. During Apollo 11  the lunar lander was nearly out of fuel before Neil Armstrong found a spot to set down. As the Apollo 12 mission got underway  lightning struck the Saturn 5 rocket during liftoff  scrambling electronic systems. Remarkably  the rocket stayed on course as an astute ground controller remembered a switch that rebooted the electronic systems. What scientists have learned in the last 50 years has minimized many of those risks. There are now much more detailed maps of the moon’s surface. Launch rules were tightened to avoid a recurrence of a lightning strike  and meteorological tools are now much more capable of detecting a buildup of electrical charge in the atmosphere before lightning discharges. Under President Trump  the top priority for NASA is to send astronauts back to the moon. Last year  his administration accelerated the timetable for the first crewed landing to 2024 from 2028 (although delays resulting from the coronavirus outbreak have raised fresh doubts about this schedule). NASA named the new moon program Artemis  after the sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. Direct comparisons between the Artemis and Apollo missions are difficult to make  because NASA has not yet decided all of the details of how it will land on the moon. Two pieces are set: the giant Space Launch System rocket — a modern-day equivalent of the Saturn 5 that lofted the Apollo crews — and the Orion crew capsule  which is like the Apollo command module  but larger. Orion can perform many tasks autonomously  but the astronauts will still be able to take over manual control if needed. Also  controllers on the ground will be able to control the spacecraft remotely  much like flying a drone aircraft. But a key piece of the Artemis architecture — the lander — has not been chosen. NASA is taking a commercial approach  soliciting proposals from companies like Blue Origin  the rocket company started by Jeffrey P. Bezos  founder and chief executive of Amazon  as well as Boeing  which is building the first stage of the S.L.S. rocket. The agency is looking to finance more than one of these lunar landing systems. Until recently  NASA’s administrator  Jim Bridenstine  had insisted that instead of the all-in-one direct approach used by Apollo  the lander would be sent separately to dock at a small space-station-like outpost called Gateway orbiting the moon. Astronauts would then lift off toward the moon aboard an Orion capsule on top of the Space Launch System. They would also dock at Gateway  where they would transfer to the lander and head down to the moon. With more pieces  more launches and multiple dockings  there would be more places where something could go wrong. If the lander were sent to lunar orbit separately  it could not serve as a lifeboat for Artemis astronauts in case of an Apollo 13-like emergency. “That would increase probability of loss of crew ” said Dr. Stanley  who led a study that devised the architecture for an earlier return-to-the-moon program called Constellation that was started under President George W. Bush and canceled by President Barack Obama. But last month  Douglas L. Loverro  NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations  told the science committee of NASA’s advisory council that he was simplifying the plans so that the Gateway would not be needed for the first Artemis landing. Dr. Stanley said the first Artemis mission could consist of two launches  with the Orion spacecraft docking with the lunar lander in Earth orbit before heading to the moon. “It’s the most reliable  safe way to do that  period ” Dr. Stanley said. Two major technological advantages available today are better sensors — for instance  a small camera in the bowels of the spacecraft could reveal the extent of any damage immediately — and improved communications systems. Apollo 13’s mission controllers and crew were hamstrung by an inability to send instructions quickly. The checklist for restarting the command module before re-entry had to be read up to the astronauts line by line  and Mr. Swigert had to write everything down by hand. “If you listen to the transcript  it’s a little bit agonizing ” said Gerry Griffin  one of the other Apollo 13 flight directors. “There is a lot of repeating. One of the problems was he couldn’t get enough paper to write on. It was a bit nerve-racking.” Today  the instructions could be simply displayed on a computer screen or printed out. But the much greater capability of modern computers comes with potential dangers. “Our biggest advantage and my biggest worry are all centered around the same area ” said Joseph W. Dyer  a retired United States Navy vice admiral who chaired NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel from 2003 to 2016. Spacecraft can now perform many tasks autonomously  but in the complex software code  “Errors find their way in and sometimes they’re catastrophic ” Mr. Dyer said. “The bottom line is  with great capability comes great complexity.” That pitfall popped up during last December’s uncrewed test of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft  designed to take NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Inadequate testing missed at least two serious software errors that led to the mission ending early and not accomplishing its main objective: docking at the space station. One of the errors could have led to the catastrophic loss of the spacecraft if it had not been caught as the capsule orbited Earth. NASA and Boeing are now reviewing more than 1 million lines of code before a repeat of the Starliner uncrewed test flight later this year. Mr. Dyer said NASA and space companies might learn from the software development processes used for high-performance military airplanes. “Space tend to be one-offs ” said Mr. Dyer  who was the program manager of the F/A-18 jet in the 1990s. “I don’t have as much faith in one as the other.” Even good software development processes and robust testing are not enough. Mr. Dyer recalled an upgrade to the computer software on the airplanes. “It worked perfectly in the northern hemisphere ” he said. But the first time an aircraft carrier took the F/A-18s below the Equator  it was discovered that there was a plus sign in the computer code that should have been a minus sign. The error did not cause any accidents  but “it speaks to the challenge of finding every potential problem ” Mr. Dyer said. Artemis will also not have as many test flights as Apollo. Astronauts are to be on board during just the second flight of the Space Launch System  and the moon landing is to be part of the third flight. But Mr. Kranz and Mr. Griffin both said that more important than the hardware is the people operating the hardware  coming up with a multitude of contingency plans. With the exhaustive training  the mission controllers were able to react quickly during Apollo 13. They opted against making an immediate U-turn  which would have required firing the engine in the damaged service module. By taking a path around the moon  the three astronauts had a longer voyage home but one the ground crew bet would be safer. For the course changes  the controllers decided to use the lunar lander’s propulsion to perform maneuvers it was never designed to do. After the initial dangers had passed and the Apollo 13 astronauts were on the path back to Earth  Mr. Haise dryly remarked from space that “this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.” When the service module was jettisoned just before re-entry  the astronauts were finally able to see the damage caused by the explosion. The call not to rely on the damaged service module had been the right one. “I had a team that was well prepared when things went wrong ” Mr. Kranz said. “It’s easier to build a spacecraft or a space system than to build the team.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/science/13SCI-APOLLO13-sm2/merlin_171478590_3ca06e58-1bb9-4398-a38d-f637223b8faa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/us/apollo-13-moon-photos-as-they-shot-it-promo-1586728596196/apollo-13-moon-photos-as-they-shot-it-promo-1586728596196-articleLarge-v2.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/13SCI-APOLLO13-bridenstine/12VIRUS-SUPERSPREADERS-bridenstine-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/health/coronavirus-remdesivir-kalil.html, health, At the Center of a Storm: The Search for a Proven Coronavirus Treatment, Taking an experimental drug can be worse than taking nothing at all  warns Dr. Andre Kalil: “You are treating emotion.”, Supported by Taking an experimental drug can be worse than taking nothing at all  warns Dr. Andre Kalil: “You are treating emotion.” By Gina Kolata OMAHA — Beginning every morning at 5:30  Dr. Andre Kalil makes himself a double espresso  runs 10 kilometers  makes additional double espressos for himself and his wife  and heads to his office at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. A deluge awaits him. Calls and insistent emails pile up each day. Patients and their doctors are clamoring for untested coronavirus treatments  encouraged by President Trump  who said that “we can’t wait” for rigorous studies of the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  and that ill patients should have ready access to experimental medicines. Dr. Kalil  54  is a principal investigator in the federal government’s clinical trial of drugs that may treat the coronavirus. It is starting with remdesivir  an antiviral drug. The first results will be ready within weeks. Dr. Kalil  who has decades of experience grappling with questions about the use — and misuse — of experimental drugs  has rarely been more frustrated. He has seen what happens when desperation drives treatment decisions. “Many drugs we believed were fantastic ended up killing people ” he said in an interview. “It is so hard to keep explaining that.” Dr. Kalil is haunted by memories of the Ebola outbreak that ravaged Africa from 2014 to 2016. Then  too  doctors said they could not wait for scientific evidence  and untested drugs were given to suffering Ebola patients by optimistic physicians with noble intentions. In the long run  none of the drugs was ever approved in the United States for treatment of the disease. Today  hope centers on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These drugs have been tested in the laboratory against many viruses: SARS and MERS — both coronaviruses — as well as H.I.V.  dengue  Ebola  chikungunya and influenza. But even when they seemed to work  what succeeded in the test tube did not succeed in real life  Dr. Kalil said. In fact  the anti-malarial drugs have never been found to work against any viral disease  including Ebola. (Malaria is caused by a parasite  not a virus.) And the drugs have side effects  including damage to the liver and bone marrow  as well as heart rhythm disturbances that could be fatal in older people and young people with serious medical problems. Even worse  Dr. Kalil said  is the promotion of the antibiotic azithromycin in combination with the anti-malarial drugs to treat Covid-19 patients. Azithromycin also may cause serious heart rhythm problems  and the combination of drugs  Dr. Kalil said  has never been tested for safety in humans. That is not to say the drugs won’t help patients with the coronavirus  only that whether this is so is unknown. “This is very charged emotionally ” Dr. Kalil said. “It is Ebola déjà vu.” Dr. Kalil  an infectious disease and intensive care specialist  is a principal investigator in an unusual federal trial that may shape the course of the coronavirus pandemic. Every surface in his office at the University of Nebraska Medical Center is piled with stacks of papers and folders — these days  there is no time to clean up. His lunch  at 3 p.m. on a recent afternoon  consisted of a turkey wrap and a bottle of water from a mini refrigerator. Dr. Kalil is voluble  lean and energetic  an unabashed patriot whose family emigrated from Brazil decades ago. He can be confrontational  and has squared off with leading scientists when he feels their treatments cannot be justified by scientific evidence. He has participated in 22 marathons  and knows that now he is running in the most important race of all. As patients and the president alike demand treatments  he wants people to understand that testing is proceeding as quickly as possible. “At the risk of sounding clichéd ” said Dr. John Lowe  assistant vice chancellor at the medical center  Dr. Kalil is “the type of person who elevates a team through his demeanor and approach to research.” There is no vaccine and no treatment for Covid-19  the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. As of Thursday  the virus has infected 1.5 million people worldwide  at least 430 000 in the United States alone  where it has killed more than 14 500 people. Remdesivir  made by Gilead  was chosen to be the first treatment evaluated in the federal effort after investigators did a careful search for drugs that might be effective. It was designed to be a broad spectrum antiviral that stops the synthesis of genetic material in a variety of viruses. Laboratory and animal studies suggested that remdesivir might be effective against coronaviruses  and safety studies had already been conducted in animals. The drug also was tested in animals infected with MERS and SARS  both caused by coronaviruses. “We don’t know if remdesivir will get into the lungs in a high enough concentration to kill the virus ” Dr. Kalil said of its possible use to treat Covid-19. “We don’t know if it will cause side effects.” It is even possible that taking the drug may hasten patients’ deaths. “That is why we need a randomized controlled trial ” he said. Although remdesivir is not approved for treatment of any illness  Gilead provided the drug to Covid-19 patients under legal exceptions for “compassionate use.” But demand escalated to such an extent that the company announced last month that it would stop giving out the antiviral. “I would never give this or any other experimental drug off-label to my patients ” Dr. Kalil said. “There is nothing compassionate about compassionate use. You are treating emotion.” The problem is not just that an experimental drug may not work or may endanger patients. It is also that if a drug is distributed to patients far and wide  no one will ever know if it works. If a Covid-19 patient takes remdesivir or chloroquine and dies  did the drug fail? Was the patient too far gone? Did the drug actually hasten death? If the patient survives  was it because of the drug? In spite of it? Without a controlled trial  there’s no good answer  and no way to compare patients once the drug is handed out routinely. The trial Dr. Kalil leads is not the only one testing remdesivir against the coronavirus. But it is the only trial with the rigor to show whether this or other drugs work in the American population. The research began in February with three patients who had been infected aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess and were flown to the University of Nebraska Medical Center. About 400 patients are now enrolled at various sites  and with that number the trial has enough patients for a preliminary analysis  now underway  which will determine if the experiment should continue with remdesivir. In the usual clinical trial  one drug is tested against a control substance — placebo or the standard-of-care drug — for a set period of time. The investigators are not permitted to see the data. When the trial ends and the data is revealed  the researchers decide if the new drug is helpful. If it is not  the process must start over with a different drug. The experiments can take years. But Dr. Kalil is running a so-called adaptive trial. Researchers start by comparing an experimental drug — in this case  remdesivir — to the placebo. After a comparatively short period of time  they peek at the data. If patients taking remdesivir are faring better than those taking the placebo  the study will move on to a second phase in which another drug is tested against remdesivir  which becomes the trial’s control. The point is to find something that shows some efficacy quickly  and there is no specific stopping point. If a drug were to bring the mortality rate to zero  of course  the trial would end abruptly and that drug would become the standard of care. If a drug were shown to halve the mortality rate  however  the question gets trickier. “Is that good enough?” Dr. Kalil wondered. He declined to say which drugs are in line for testing after remdesivir  concerned that he might set off another wave of demand for unproven drugs. In addition to criticizing the demand for the drug under compassionate use  Dr. Kalil also lamented publication of case studies in prestigious medical journals of single patients who took an untested drug. “Publishing a single case report of an experimental drug as an original article in a high-impact journal during an outbreak is akin to sensationalist news ” he said. “We must do better than that to save lives during a pandemic ” he said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/census-coronavirus-delay.html, us, Knocked Off Track by Coronavirus  Census Announces Delay in 2020 Count, The Census Bureau said it would extend the deadlines for collecting census data and would ask Congress for a delay in providing final counts used for congressional redistricting., Supported by The Census Bureau said it would extend the deadlines for collecting census data and would ask Congress for a delay in providing final counts used for congressional redistricting. By Michael Wines WASHINGTON — Conceding that its effort to count the nation’s population has been hamstrung by the coronavirus pandemic  the Census Bureau said on Monday it would ask Congress for a four-month delay in delivering the census data used to reapportion the House of Representatives and political districts nationwide. In a news release  the bureau said it would ask that delivery of the final census figures be postponed to April 31  120 days beyond the existing Dec. 31 deadline. That would mean that state legislatures would get final population figures for drawing new maps as late as July 31  2021. Delivery of that data normally is completed by the end of March. The bureau also said it would extend the deadline for collecting census data  now Aug. 15  to Oct. 31  and would begin reopening its field offices — which have been shuttered since mid-March — sometime after June 1. Democrats who oversee census operations in the House Oversight and Reform Committee reacted cautiously to the news  which they said was relayed early Monday to a handful of members of Congress in a telephone call with officials from the White House and the Commerce Department. The director of the census  Steven Dillingham  apparently did not participate in the call. “The oversight committee will carefully examine the administration’s request  but we need more information than the administration has been willing to provide ” the committee’s chairwoman  Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York  said in a statement. “If the administration is trying to avoid the perception of politicizing the census  preventing the census director from briefing the committee and then excluding him from a call organized by the White House are not encouraging moves.” That was echoed by a number of experts who said that the aura of secrecy surrounding this census  in sharp contrast to previous ones  limited support for the count and raised questions about what  if anything  was being concealed. “It’s worrisome that the conversation with Congress wasn’t opened until today ” said Margo J. Anderson  a history professor and census scholar at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. It just doesn’t help. It’s going to be hard enough to get this done.” The 2020 head count has been mired in controversy since 2017  when the administration tried to amend the census questionnaire to count the number of noncitizens  which was widely seen as an effort to give Republicans a political edge in next year’s redistricting. Many experts also have expressed fears that the administration’s harsh anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric would deter minorities from filling out census forms  leading to an undercount that also would work to Republicans’ benefit. A lengthy delay in reporting census figures to the states could throw a wrench into at least some states’ efforts to draw new political maps. Most states have fixed deadlines for approving new maps  some of them written into state constitutions  that could prove hard or impossible to meet if population figures are delayed into the summer  according to Jeffrey M. Wice  a redistricting expert and senior fellow at New York Law School. “This could open a can of worms depending on the policies of the states ” he said. “It’s not inconceivable that some states might use administrative records to redistrict instead of the decennial census count ” a change that could have a substantial political impact depending on the data used. The Constitution requires states to use census data for apportioning political districts — in other words  to ensure that districts like House seats are roughly equal in population. But courts have left the door open for states to use different population figures to actually draw maps in some circumstances. Republicans in some states have expressed interest in basing maps on population counts that exclude noncitizens or are limited to registered voters  formulas that would give minorities and other Democratic-leaning groups less political representation. Census officials have said that response to the census — the first to be conducted largely over the internet — had been meeting expectations. But the bureau already had been forced once to extend the shutdown of field operations that it first announced in March. Efforts to count millions of households in specialized segments of the population — homeless people and those without fixed addresses  such as Native Americans on reservations — have been in limbo  awaiting the bureau’s decision when it would be safe to begin or resume them. As of Monday  48.1 percent of households had filled out census forms  with well over a month remaining in the formal period for responding. In the last census in 2010  66.5 percent of households filled out forms; most of the rest were contacted by an army of door-knockers  called enumerators  who started work after the formal deadline for responding had passed. This year  the door-knocking was scheduled to begin in mid-May  then postponed to late May. The bureau said Monday only that this count and other field operations would begin “as quickly as possible” after June 1  and last until Oct. 31. A vast array of businesses  nonprofit groups and state and local governments have huge stakes in the census  which sets the benchmark for the next decade’s allocation of federal grants and subsidies  for marketing and planning studies that shape entire cities and  of course  for political representation. Well before the announcement on Monday  some had expressed concern that the coronavirus could render a head count already beset by political infighting and public suspicion too troubled to produce an accurate accounting of the nation. The announcement appears certain to fan those fears. “The breadth of the challenge facing the 2020 census is unprecedented ” said Terri Ann Lowenthal  an expert on the census who represents many groups seeking an accurate count. “The fundamental question Congress must address in considering the bureau’s request is whether the significant shifts in operations will contribute to lower accuracy in communities already at risk of disproportionate undercounting.” The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund  which works nationwide to bolster Hispanic response to the count  said in a statement that the delay was a signal that the accuracy of the count could be imperiled without more support. “There is only so much the bureau can do on its own to maintain the integrity of the process amid a national crisis like the one we are experiencing with Covid-19 ” the statement said. “Congress has the authority and obligation to work with the bureau in taking a close look at all steps required to ensure an accurate count of all residents in the United States.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

To get the most benefit  you need to avoid these common mistakes. By Tara Parker-Pope Almost overnight  masks in a variety of colors  styles and materials have appeared on the faces of people around us. While it’s good news that many people are doing their part to slow the spread of coronavirus  the bad news is that many people are wearing their masks wrong. “Wearing a mask takes some getting used to  for sure ” said Dr. Scott Segal  chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health. “You are probably wearing it exactly right if it’s a little stuffy.” One of the biggest mistakes people make is that they fidget with their masks  and pull them under their noses or completely off their faces to rest under their chins. “You should absolutely not be pulling up and putting down your mask while you’re out ” said Shan Soe-Lin  a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. “If you’re going to go to the trouble of using a mask  leave it on.” Here are the dos and don’ts of wearing a mask. And once you’ve figured out the correct position for wearing your mask  follow these tips to stay safe: Always wash your hands before and after wearing a mask. Use the ties or loops to put your mask on and pull it off. Don’t touch the front of the mask when you take it off. For apartment dwellers  put the mask on and remove it while inside your home. Elevators and stairwells can be high-contamination areas. Wash and dry your cloth mask daily and keep it in a clean  dry place. Don’t have a false sense of security. Masks offer limited protection  and work better when combined with hand washing and social distancing. “It’s not that one excludes the other ” said Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee  assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University. “They compound the effects of the other.” Illustrations by Eleni Kalorkoti Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/10/us/Parker-Pope-Tara/Parker-Pope-Tara-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/smarter-living/14virus-maskdonts1/00well-mask-too-low-articleLarge-v2.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Anton Troianovski MOSCOW — The head of Russia’s coronavirus task force  Tatyana Golikova  assured President Vladimir V. Putin in mid-March that the country was ready to take on the pandemic. From masks to ventilators  she said  Russia’s hospitals had everything they needed to weather the crisis. “There is no reason at all to panic ” she said. A week later  the head doctor of one of Moscow’s top hospitals caring for coronavirus patients quietly wrote to a medical charity asking for help. The hospital  he wrote  was in need of “disposable materials and equipment” to continue to serve the critically ill. “We’re used to always living  somehow  in the unspoken  looking through rose-colored glasses ” said Elena Smirnova  the head of the charity  Sozidaniye. “They can’t hide this anymore.” For weeks  the coronavirus pandemic had the makings of a Kremlin propaganda coup; even as Western countries succumbed one by one  Russia appeared invincible  recording fewer than 100 new cases a day through late March despite its tightly packed cities  global travel connections and 2 600-mile land border with China. There was talk that Mr. Putin’s early move to shut down most travel from China  along with an extensive testing and contact-tracing effort rooted in the Soviet Union’s disease-fighting legacy  was succeeding where Italy  Spain and the United States all had failed. So confident was the Kremlin that it dispatched planeloads of aid to Italy  Serbia and even Kennedy Airport in New York  signaling that Russia had stockpiled so many masks and ventilators that it was able to share some of them with less fortunate countries. But it has become clear in recent days that Russia is unlikely to escape a severe hit by the pandemic  presenting an existential test to the country’s teetering health system and a new challenge to the aura of rising confidence and competence projected by Mr. Putin’s Kremlin. “We have a lot of problems  and we don’t have much to brag about  nor reason to  and we certainly can’t relax ” Mr. Putin told senior officials Monday in his bleakest comments on the crisis yet. “We are not past the peak of the epidemic  not even in Moscow.” Mr. Putin warned of overworked medical staff and shortages of protective equipment  acknowledging what critics said was long clear: that Russia’s health system could be strained beyond its breaking point by the pandemic  and that the government needed to do more to get ready. There were also worrying signs of the pandemic spreading outside Moscow. The government airlifted a field hospital to an Arctic town near the border with Norway  where hundreds of workers at a construction site were feared infected. The town of Vyazma  130 miles west of Moscow  was closed off because of an outbreak at a nursing home  and 1 000 people were reported to be under quarantine in a hospital in the south-central city of Ufa. As footage of hourslong lines of ambulances outside Moscow emergency rooms ricocheted through Russian social networks over the weekend  health officials went on state television and confirmed that the images were real. “We objectively did not pay very much attention ” Ms. Golikova  the task force head  admitted in an interview aired Sunday night  “to how effectively the infectious disease service needs to be prepared.” By Monday  Russia’s total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 had reached 18 328  double the level of five days earlier. The number of deaths stood at 148  a number widely seen as an undercount amid reports of other causes of death being declared for people who were ill with Covid-like symptoms. The epicenter of the pandemic in Russia is Moscow  the biggest city in Europe  with a population of some 13 million and about two-thirds of the country’s coronavirus cases. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin  Mr. Putin’s former chief of staff  has won praise  even from some Kremlin critics  for leveling with the public about the threat of the disease and taking aggressive measures to try to slow its spread. On March 24  Mr. Sobyanin told Mr. Putin that the number of infected Russians was significantly higher than the official data. Days later  he ordered all Muscovites to stay home. But the Kremlin continued to play down the seriousness of the threat. “There is de facto no epidemic” in Russia  the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov told reporters on March 26. Under the surface  however  Russian hospitals were scrambling to prepare  with limited resources. Ms. Smirnova  of the Sozidaniye charity  launched a drive in late March to help hospitals fighting the coronavirus buy equipment and supplies. The 19-year-old organization has supported hospitals in the past  but typically in relatively poor  far-flung parts of the country. Never in her two decades of charity work  Ms. Smirnova said  had she seen so many senior big-city hospital officials put their jobs on the line by asking for help. “You must understand  a head doctor who says all is well is a ‘good' doctor ” she said. “If he says  ‘Things aren’t good at all  I’ve reached out to a charity ’ he is taking a risk.” Working with Russia’s biggest state-owned bank  Sberbank  Sozidaniye raised more than $120 000 for hospitals across Russia  including nine in and around Moscow. One of them  City Clinical Hospital No. 52 in northwestern Moscow  has been relying on close to 100 volunteers to distribute food for medical workers and care packages for patients and even for help in setting up a new call center. Inside  with the hospital flooded with virus patients  conditions resemble those of military field medicine more than typical hospital care  a surgeon  Dr. Aleksandr Vanyukov  said in a phone interview. For now  he said  supplies of protective gear were sufficient. But he said he was increasingly losing hope that Moscow would be spared the fate of hard-hit Western cities  in part because residents last week seemed to be relaxing their adherence to stay-at-home orders. “When everyone was sitting at home and carefully observing the quarantine  it seemed like we were managing ” Dr. Vanyukov said. But if the current pace of growth continues  he said  “we’ll be in a New York-type situation rather soon  probably.” “We’ll just drown ” he said. With the epidemic bearing down  Russia’s state news media — which is adept at playing down domestic problems — has started to acknowledge its severity. The evening news on state-run Channel 1 on Sunday showed the lines of ambulances outside Moscow area hospitals  and spoke of the “colossal pressure increasing with every day.” The head doctor of the Filatovskaya hospital said it was treating 1 525 patients  despite a capacity of 1 350 beds. Another doctor said the hospital would enlist psychologists to help its workers handle the pressure. Moscow’s medical personnel  the news report warned  are being stretched dangerously thin. “In terms of doctors  things are difficult but bearable ” a Channel 1 reporter said. “But nurses are in catastrophically short supply.” In a videoconference on the pandemic with Ms. Golikova  Mayor Sobyanin and others on Monday  Mr. Putin warned that things were getting worse  with the number of severely ill patients rising. He directed officials to take steps to remedy shortages in medical workers’ protective equipment and to share ventilators and medicine across Russia’s far-flung regions to respond to geographic differences in demand. “All scenarios of how the situation could develop must be taken into account  including the most difficult and extraordinary ones ” Mr. Putin said.

The case has become a pivotal test for China’s fledgling #MeToo movement., Supported by An 18-year-old has accused a prominent lawyer of sexually abusing her for years. The case has become a pivotal test for China’s fledgling #MeToo movement. By Javier C. Hernández At 14 years old  she was sent by her mother to live with a successful businessman in Beijing  who was supposed to serve as her caretaker and guardian. Instead  over the course of several years  she says  he repeatedly raped her and held her in his home against her will. Now 18  the young woman  using the pseudonym Xingxing  has gone public with her account of abuse. Her story  published in the Chinese news media in recent days  has become one of the most widely discussed topics in China  unleashing a wave of anger about the country’s patriarchal culture and the authorities’ reluctance to intervene in cases of sexual abuse. The episode has become a pivotal test for China’s small but spirited #MeToo movement  which has gained traction in recent years despite the ruling Communist Party’s strict limits on activism and its tight control over the courts. The man at the center of the case is Bao Yuming  a lawyer who studied in the United States and has advised some of China’s most prominent companies  including ZTE  the telecommunications giant. Mr. Bao  who is in his late 40s  has acknowledged that he had a close relationship with Xingxing but has denied any wrongdoing. After Xingxing took her case to the news media  he was dismissed from his job as the vice president of a large oil company in eastern China  and he has since resigned from his role as a board member at ZTE. On Monday  as public anger grew amid reports that the police initially ignored Xingxing’s complaints  the central government in Beijing said it would investigate. A hashtag about the case on Weibo  a popular social media site in China  had been viewed more than 790 million times as of late Monday. Dozens of women in China have come forward in recent years with stories of abuse at the hands of powerful men. Some have won justice against prominent figures in business  the media and academia  while others have struggled to be heard  blocked by lawsuits  harassment and government censors. The experience of Xingxing highlights the challenges many Chinese women face in trying to report sexual abuse. The authorities often side with men in such cases  activists say  and rarely investigate accusations of rape and sexual assault. “There are too many cases like this ” said Guo Jianmei  a lawyer who is assisting Xingxing. “Only when a case this vicious is exposed can it touch people’s nerves.” In her account  which was first published last week by South Reviews  a Chinese magazine  Xingxing said she first came into contact with Mr. Bao in 2015. Xingxing’s mother connected with Mr. Bao online after seeing that he was looking to adopt a child  according to Chinese news reports  and thought that her daughter would be better raised by a successful businessman. Such informal arrangements are common in China  where adoption is strictly regulated. But the practice can lead to abuse  activists say  giving parents incentive to sell their children for financial gain and providing a vehicle for human trafficking. In her account  Xingxing said Mr. Bao presented himself as a father figure but quickly turned abusive. He tried to justify his intimate behavior with her by showing her child pornography  she said. She said he installed a camera in the living room to ensure she did not leave and warned her against telling others of his behavior. Frightened and distraught  she said  she tried to commit suicide several times. Mr. Bao  who also goes by the name Robert Y. Bao  could not be reached for comment. He has described himself as a graduate of the University of Bridgeport  in Connecticut  who has advised prominent multinational companies  including Cisco and News Corp. In an interview that was posted last week by several Chinese news sites  he accused Xingxing of fabricating the accusations against him. “I want to refute it from beginning to end ” he said. “What she said is all recklessly concocted.” Xingxing said she reported Mr. Bao’s behavior repeatedly to the police during the several years she lived with him and provided evidence  only to be turned away. The police in Yantai  a city in eastern China where Mr. Bao worked  said in a statement posted on social media last week that they had reopened an investigation into the case. ZTE  the telecommunications company where Mr. Bao was a board member  said in a statement it was “concerned” by the reports. Activists in China said the publication of Xingxing’s story was an important development in the country’s #MeToo movement. “People’s awareness of feminist issues is becoming stronger and stronger ” said Hu Jiawei  the founder of a sex education site. “But there are legislative loopholes and attention is still needed.” As reports about Xingxing’s accusations spread on social media  lawyers  activists  intellectuals and celebrities took to social media to express support for her. Many said China should do more to prevent sexual assault of children. “It is exposed time and time again  and vanishes without a trace again and again ” Zhang Ziyi  a well-known Chinese actress  wrote on Weibo. “No severe punishment  only protection. Don’t the policemen’s hearts ache?” Claire Fu  Coral Yang and Albee Zhang contributed research.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/supreme-court-phone-arguments-virus.html, us politics, The Supreme Court Will Hear Arguments by Phone. The Public Can Listen In., For the first time  the nation’s highest court will open a live audio feed as it hears arguments in 10 sets of cases., Supported by For the first time  the nation’s highest court will open a live audio feed as it hears arguments in 10 sets of cases. By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court announced on Monday that it would hear arguments by telephone over six days in May. In a major break with tradition  the court said it would for the first time allow live remote access to audio of the arguments. Among the cases the justices will hear are three about subpoenas from prosecutors and Congress seeking President Trump’s financial records. “In keeping with public health guidance in response to Covid-19 ” a news release from the court said  “the justices and counsel will all participate remotely. The court anticipates providing a live audio feed of these arguments to news media. Details will be shared as they become available.” Although the release referred only to access by the news media  a court spokeswoman said the audio feed would also be available to the public. The court said arguments would be heard on May 4  5  6  11  12 and 13  and it listed the 10 sets of arguments it would hear. But it did not say which cases would be heard when. That would depend  the court said  on “the availability of counsel.” Other courts have been hearing oral arguments online  with video. The Supreme Court stopped short of taking that step. Still  Monday’s announcement was a significant move for a court that has never allowed camera coverage or live audio. On 27 occasions over the last two decades  it has released same-day audio. But its usual practice is to release transcripts within hours but audio only at the end of the week. The court had already postponed 20 arguments that had been scheduled for March and April  citing the coronavirus pandemic. Monday’s announcement listed 10 sets of cases to be argued in May  which included most of the major ones. The remaining arguments  including a $9 billion copyright dispute between Google and Oracle  will be rescheduled for the court’s next term  which begins in October. Hearing arguments on the phone will present some challenges for the justices  who frequently interrupt lawyers and talk over one another. They may have set some ground rules  like asking questions in order of seniority. The court ordinarily stops hearing arguments in April  to give itself time to issue decisions by the usual end of the court’s term  in June. Hearing arguments in May could require the justices to issue decisions in July or later  shortening their traditional three-month summer break. In addition to the cases on Mr. Trump’s financial records  the court said it would hear arguments in several other major cases. One concerns whether members of the Electoral College must cast their votes for presidential candidates other than the ones they had pledged to support. The court’s answer to that question could affect the presidential election  and lawyers on both sides had urged the court to decide it before the justices knew which candidate could benefit from their ruling. The court will also hear arguments in two cases involving religion. One concerns how broadly federal employment discrimination laws apply to schools run by churches. In the other  the court will decide whether the Trump administration may allow employers to limit women’s access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act. Still other cases to be argued in May concern robocalls  trademarks and whether much of Oklahoma is an Indian reservation. The court will also decide three major cases that have already been argued  including a challenge to a Louisiana law that could leave the state with a single abortion clinic  a case on whether a landmark civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from employment discrimination and one on whether Mr. Trump may shut down a program that protects young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation and allows them to work. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/us/politics/13dc-virus-scotus/merlin_171349110_0c5ae95f-5d7c-4205-9f14-d9b0395027e1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v3.png 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/aoc-progressives-joe-biden.html, us politics, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Has Never Spoken to Joe Biden. Here’s What She Would Say., In an interview  Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she intended to support the presumptive Democratic nominee  but the “process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved.”, Supported by In an interview  Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she intended to support the presumptive Democratic nominee  but the “process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved.” By Astead W. Herndon The progressive wing of the Democratic Party fell flat in this year’s presidential primary  and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knows it. Even before Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race last week  making former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the party’s presumptive nominee  Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was ruminating on the lessons the left must learn to be more successful moving forward. But in the short term  Democrats are desperate to defeat President Trump in November  and Mr. Biden is making some policy overtures to unite the party. The hope is to win over supporters of Mr. Sanders as well as top surrogates like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez  a New York congresswoman who is popular among young progressives — a group Mr. Biden is struggling to win. In a recent phone interview  Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made clear that she intended to support the Democratic nominee  but said his current overtures to progressives must go further. She made a distinction between supporting Mr. Biden in November and offering a full-throated endorsement of his campaign. Where she lands  she said  is up to him. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Q. I guess my first question is simple: Has the Biden campaign reached out to you? A. No. OK. Well  what type of outreach are you looking for? Not just to you but to progressives broadly. There’s this talk about unity as this kind of vague  kumbaya  kind of term. Unity and unifying isn’t a feeling  it’s a process. And what I hope does not happen in this process is that everyone just tries to shoo it along and brush real policies — that mean the difference of life and death or affording your insulin and not affording your insulin — just brush that under the rug as an aesthetic difference of style. There’s also this idea that if we all just support the nominee that voters will come along as well. I’ve flagged  very early  two patterns that I saw [among Biden’s campaign]  which is underperformance among Latinos and young people  both of which are very important demographics in November. And so  I don’t think this conversation about changes that need to be made is one about throwing the progressive wing of the party a couple of bones — I think this is about how we can win. The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved — that’s how you know it’s working. And if Biden is only doing things he’s comfortable with  then it’s not enough. Can you give me examples of areas that you want to see him get “uncomfortable?” They floated this olive branch to the progressive left of lowering the Medicare age to 60. And it’s almost insulting. I think Hillary was looking at policies that lowered it to 50. So we’re talking about a “progressive concession” that is 10 years worse than what the nominee had in 2016. Progressives aren’t a monolith like every voting block isn’t a monolith. But I also know  from a Latino perspective  I think we need a real plan to be better than what happened during his service with the Obama administration. In terms of deportations? In terms of deportations  in terms of apprehensions  I mean  even in terms of rhetoric. It was just a couple months ago that he told immigrant activists to vote for someone else. I want to see him get uncomfortable there. Putting “Dreamers” on a path to citizenship is great  but that’s a policy concession from 10 years ago. People need to feel hope in a Democratic administration. And that’s what this is about. If we’re not talking about paths to citizenship for undocumented people  and if we’re just talking about policy changes of 5 or 10 percent — especially when you look at something like climate change — it’s not about moving to the left. It’s about who is able to find hope in your administration. And creating plans that give people hope and possibility. But Biden has gotten to this point by rejecting some of these things. What’s your realistic level of confidence he will get uncomfortable on these issues? He’s been in this game a long time. I think the ideological argument is a false one  and I think that’s backed up by exit polling. While Biden is the nominee  we also know that he didn’t win because of policy — I don’t think he won because of his agenda  he won because of different factors. In state after state after state  Democratic voters support a progressive agenda. I want to respect his win  he won because of his coalition building  he won because of his service  he won for a lot of different reasons — but I don’t think he won because Americans don’t want “Medicare for all.” And in this moment  I wouldn’t be surprised if what we’re seeing with coronavirus didn’t further change people’s views in further support of a progressive agenda. How should the relationship that progressives had in 2016 with Hillary Clinton inform the way you all go about it in 2020 with Biden? What are the lessons from how that turned out that are worth changing  or replicating  this time around? As much as a dumpster fire as Twitter can be sometimes  I actually think the process was much less painful and nasty and fraught than it was in 2016. In 2016  things like superdelegates delegitimized the process so much that it felt a lot more scorched-earth  and I’m not even talking about between the two candidates  but just how voters felt about the party. I think people understand that there are limits to what Biden will do and that’s understandable — he didn’t run as a progressive candidate. But  at the bare minimum  we should aspire to be better than what we have been before. And I just don’t know if this message of “We’re going to go back to the way things were” is going to work for the people for who the way things were was really bad. Is an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsement of Joe Biden a sure thing? I’ve always said that I will support the Democratic nominee. But unity is a process  and figuring out what that looks like is part of this whole conversation that I think Bernie and Warren and other folks are a part of as well. Yes. But I guess I’m asking about you. Is there something you’re looking for? Is there a difference between voting for him or campaigning for him? What are the range of possibilities of your relationship with the Democratic nominee in the next months? Beating Donald Trump is a matter of life or death for our communities. I think it’s a difference between making an argument for harm reduction  and making the argument for  there’s actually going to be progress made for us. What I want to do is to be able to go out and say  “This is the plan for us.” But it’s hard to do that if there’s no plan for us. And who’s us? Any number of communities  whether it’s the Bronx  whether it’s Latinos  or whether it’s people of color  whether it’s women  whether it’s young people  whether it’s people with student debt  whether it’s working-class people  or people with no health care. And you know  I’m not trying to be divisive. But when you talk about lessons from 2016  one of the most divisive things that we can do is just smother and silence legitimate points of critique — especially from people whose lives are most at risk in this administration. Because  for some people  this argument of returning to normalcy sounds like an argument of respectability politics and civility. And for other people  it sounds like  will my child be put in a cage? Aesthetics plays a big role in politics  a huge one. But I just want to improve people’s lives. And while we’ll improve people’s lives with Donald Trump not in the White House  we need to do better than what we’ve done before. I’m a progressive [laughter]. That’s literally what it means. What if Biden doesn’t do it? What if he doesn’t get uncomfortable? And you know  only gives kind of aesthetic  in-name-only concessions to the left? What do you do? I will be supporting the Democratic nominee in November. I would just hope that the nominee supports our communities too. Is a Biden-A.O.C. unity rally ever in the cards? It could be. I have not talked to the vice president. Ever? Never. Not that I know of  no. But I know the goal ultimately is to win. And I’m not trying to needle as a way of making a point or to score points. I want to win. And I want to make sure that we win broadly. Do you worry about causing damage to the vice president in a way that helps Donald Trump? How do you square unity with applying pressure from the left? It’s a tightrope. I do not feel a choice in adhering to my principles and my integrity  and being accountable to the movement that brought me here. But also  I don’t want another term of Trump. I’m not going to lie to people and say Puerto Rico’s debt is going to be forgiven or there’s going to be some audit of the debt if that’s not the plan. But at the same time  I don’t want this president throwing paper towels at my family again. I just want to tell the truth and I want to feel good about the truth.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/arts/music/andy-gonzalez-dead.html, arts music, Andy González  Prolific Latin Jazz Bassist  Is Dead at 69, A busy studio musician  he was also a key part of two influential groups: the Fort Apache Band  which he founded with his brother Jerry  and Libre., Supported by A busy studio musician  he was also a key part of two influential groups: the Fort Apache Band  which he founded with his brother Jerry  and Libre. By Neil Genzlinger Andy González  one of the great bassists in Latin jazz  who in a career of more than four decades played with numerous influential groups — notably the Fort Apache Band  which he formed with his brother Jerry — died on Thursday in the Bronx. He was 69. His sister  Eileen González-Altomari  said the causes were pneumonia and complications of diabetes. Mr. González was a versatile player  as well as an arranger  composer  music historian and producer of other musicians’ records. He embraced African  Cuban and Puerto Rican styles  various strains of jazz and other influences  often merging them into something fresh. The Boston Globe once called him “a modernist preoccupied with tradition.” He grew up in a musical household in the Bronx; he and Jerry  a trumpeter and percussionist who was 18 months older  would practice together in the basement. Their father  a vocalist in his own band in the 1950s and ’60s  was their earliest musical influence. Mr. González played with the bands of the percussionist Ray Barretto and the pianist Eddie Palmieri as he was establishing himself. In 1974  he and the timbale player Manny Oquendo formed Conjunto Libre (the name was later shortened to Libre)  a band that  mixing salsa and jazz  explored “an immensely varied body of folk  popular and experimental music  without ever losing its New York Latin feel ” as Robert Palmer put it in The New York Times in 1984. Libre  with Mr. Gonzalez as musical director  remained an important part of the jazz scene for 35 years  releasing a dozen albums and advancing the careers of many players who passed through the group. Mr. Oquendo died in 2009. In about 1980  the González brothers formed another pivotal group  the Fort Apache Band (named after a nickname for a Bronx police precinct house). It had a freewheeling style that mixed jazz and Afro-Cuban music in “a disciplined bilingual inquisitiveness ” as The Times said in 1995. “This is New York music ” Jerry González told the newspaper. “We play music influenced by everything we’ve experienced here. We play Mongo Santamaria  John Coltrane and James Brown all at the same time.” A key part of that adventurousness was Andy González’s bass. “I can’t think of a more fluid  powerful  and amazing rhythm section ” the pianist and composer Arturo O’Farrill told JazzTimes in 2019. “Those guys could stop on a dime and turn it around and do anything  float through space and gyrate and levitate. They really were the most important rhythm section in the history of Latin jazz.” Jerry González died at 69 in a fire in Madrid in 2018. Andrew González was born on Jan. 1  1951  in Manhattan into a family of Puerto Rican descent. His father  Geraldo (known as Jerry  like his son)  introduced his children to salsa and other types of music via his substantial record collection. His mother  Julia (Toyos) González  was a homemaker who also did secretarial work at New York University and  for a time  for the F.B.I. Mr. González was raised in the Bronx. In an interview with the website Herencia Latina in the early 2000s  he said he had played violin in his elementary school’s orchestra. “One of the bass players — there were two bass players — moved away  so there was a need for a bass player  and I was the tallest violinist ” he said. “I was playing in the second violin section. And so they asked me if I wanted to play the bass  and I said  ‘Sure  I’ll give it a try.’” A musicologist who lived in his neighborhood and had a vast record collection  Rene Lopez  furthered his education. “I was listening to Cuban music but did not know how deep it was until I went to his place ” Mr. González told The Globe in 1992. “Then I became a collector myself ” he added. “In those days  there were some record shops that had 78s and were dying to get rid of them  so they would sell them to me at 10 cents each.” Mr. González was playing bass in bands while still a teenager. He graduated from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan and tried Bronx Community College for a time  but he was already so immersed in the music scene that he gave up his pursuit of a degree for the life of a professional musician. That included not only performing but also recording — by 1995  The Times said  he had been a part of more than 700 sessions. He is credited on albums by Mr. Palmieri  Mr. Barretto  Tito Puente  Astor Piazzolla  Hilton Ruiz and countless others. His versatility as a musician was much admired. It was a trait he tried to impart to younger bassists  whom he sometimes found to be inflexible and lacking in musical history. “They know one style  one way of playing  they play certain rhythms the right way ” he told The Globe. “But they don’t know the whole story.” Mr. González thought his playing career might be over in 2004  when health problems related to diabetes landed him in a hospital for two months. He played a recording session hours before being admitted. “I could play  but I was so weak  I couldn’t even take the cover off the bass ” he told JazzTimes in 2007  “so I asked somebody in the studio to do it for me. So I played the session  and then that night I called my friend to come and bring me straight to the hospital.” The toes on one foot had to be amputated. “It took me about six months to start playing again ” he said  “because so much antibiotics made my hands swell up like two ham hocks  and I couldn’t even bend my fingers.” But there was plenty of music to come. In 2016  at the age of 65  he released his first album solely under his name  “Entre Colegas.” In a brief review in The New York Times  Ben Ratliff wrote  “It’s casual  modern  traditional  deliberately understated  stealthily gorgeous.” It was nominated for a Grammy Award for best Latin jazz album. In addition to his sister  Mr. González is survived by a brother  Arthur. In the 1995 interview with The Times  Mr. González talked about his and the Fort Apache Band’s determination not to be locked into one style. “Our music isn’t the product of a course  or a book ” he said. “It comes from a search  and you come to be aware of what you’re looking for. You have a revelation about how you feel music should go.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/obituaries/10Gonzalez2/merlin_50212095_f00771e4-b849-472b-afd2-3d13dfc8bd90-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-neil-genzlinger/author-neil-genzlinger-thumbLarge.jpg 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-cases.html, opinion, The Global Coronavirus Crisis Is Poised to Get Much  Much Worse, What happens when the pandemic strikes nations of millions of people that have only a half-dozen ventilators?, Supported by What happens when the pandemic strikes nations of millions of people that have only a half-dozen ventilators? By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. In some places in the United States and other developed countries hit hard by Covid-19  the question is when might it become possible to start getting back to work. For much of the rest of the world  the nightmare is yet to start. And part of the horror is that many poorer countries won’t have the means to do much about it. Nor  given the international community’s lack of organization and leadership in the face of a global crisis  can they count on richer nations to help them. With the exception of Iran  the countries hardest hit up till now are among those with the world’s most advanced economies  scientific establishments and medical services — and even Iran has a relatively functional medical system. What probably lies ahead is the spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict  through packed refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh  through teeming cities like Mumbai  Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia  where social distancing is impossible and government is not trusted  through countries without the fiscal capacity or health services to mount a viable response. That would be disastrous not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies of raw materials are disrupted  fragile economies collapse  strongmen grow stronger and the virus doubles back to reinfect northern regions. So far  the most vulnerable regions have reported comparatively few cases — one in Yemen  a smattering across Africa and the Middle East. But that may be partly a function of unreliable reporting or deliberate denial. The numbers are growing  and as the world has learned  they are likely to swell radically and swiftly. A survey by the International Crisis Group said the full impact is hard to anticipate  but  “If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centers in fragile states  it may be virtually impossible to control. The dramatic economic slowdown already underway will disrupt trade flows and create unemployment that will do damage at levels that are hard to forecast and grim to contemplate.” For a sense of the scale of the plight of some developing nations  consider one of the most critical pieces of medical equipment used in treatment: the ventilator. The United States has some 160 000 ventilators  according to one estimate. Sierra Leone has 13. South Sudan has four. Central African Republic has three. In Venezuela  where 90 percent of the hospitals already face shortages  there are only 84 intensive care unit beds for a population of 32 million  according to a report from the International Rescue Committee. “The lesson of the crisis is that the weakest links in the global health chain are a threat to health everywhere ” said David Miliband  the organization’s president. “We cannot afford these weak links  and must strengthen the efforts in war-torn countries and communities to lift their life chances.” In the United States and Europe  governments and businesses have been able to pay many furloughed workers at least part of their salaries  and others are eligible for unemployment benefits. But billions of people in Africa  Latin America and South Asia have no safety net and no savings. The United Nations has warned that income loss in developing countries could exceed $220 billion. The impact will not be uniform. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have moved quickly to offer billions in emergency loans to poorer countries  though they’ve warned this will not be enough. Countries with relatively stable governments  like Peru  have been quick to mount countermeasures  while battered nations like Haiti and Venezuela have few defenses available. Some dictatorships  like Egypt  have used the outbreak to tighten their grip. Across the Southern Hemisphere  the pandemic’s effects may be cushioned by young populations. In such African countries as Niger  Angola  Chad  Mali  Uganda and Somalia  nearly half the population is 15 or younger. In the United States  that share is 19 percent. The U.N. secretary general  Antonio Guterres  and Pope Francis have both called for a cessation of all global conflicts to focus on what Mr. Guterres called “the true fight of our lives.” Last week Saudi Arabia announced a cease-fire in its war against Houthi rebels in Yemen  and armed groups have indicated a desire to stop fighting in Colombia  Cameroon and the Philippines. The Afghan government and the Taliban have both begun efforts to stem the spread of the virus. And Russia may find the burden of supporting Syrian troops or secessionists in western Ukraine excessive if Covid-19 begins to take a heavy toll on the economy. But the Islamic State has called on its followers to ramp up their efforts. The Houthis have not reciprocated Saudi Arabia’s cease-fire  and fighting has escalated in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It is understandable that governments of rich nations have focused first and foremost on the crisis within their own borders. Nothing like the coronavirus has ever overwhelmed so much of the world in such short order  or with such cataclysmic force. Yet it is dismaying that a danger that confronts the entire world  that is likely to hurt the entire global economy  has led to so little global cooperation and has been met with so little global leadership. This is a crisis in which the United States could have emerged as the leader. The country still may do so. But on top of the widely chronicled failures at home  the Trump administration has provided little inspiration for the world. The response in Europe has also been marked by confusion and disunity: The president of the European Union’s main science organization resigned last week in protest of the bloc's handling of the crisis. The World Health Organization  meanwhile  is under heavy fire from critics who say its complicated relationship with China may have undermined its mission. That is not likely to change  especially while the disease continues to ravage the United States  Italy  Spain and many other countries in the Northern Hemisphere  and most especially in an American presidential election year  when the struggle against Covid-19 is likely to become only more politicized. But the weakness of Washington should not prevent the brain trust of the developed world — the think tanks  news media  universities and nongovernmental organizations — from focusing on a strategy for the next and possibly most brutal front in the struggle against the scourge of the coronavirus. Many organizations have already begun to do so  recognizing that this may be the defining struggle of our era  and that if ever the world demanded a global response  this is it.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/jobs-republicans-covid.html, opinion, Republicans Don’t Want to Save Jobs, Billions for oil  nothing for nurses and teachers., Supported by Billions for oil  nothing for nurses and teachers. By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Recent job losses have been nothing short of apocalyptic. Almost 17 million workers — more than 10 percent of the work force — filed for unemployment benefits over the course of just three weeks. Independent economists suggest that the unemployment rate may already be close to 20 percent  which is similar to its level in the depths of the Great Depression. So how are the Trump administration and its allies responding to this Covid-19-generated jobs crisis? Are they taking it seriously? Or are they doing what they did as the pandemic spread — dithering and refusing to take necessary action out of some combination of wishful thinking and political pettiness? You can probably guess the answer. By all accounts  Donald Trump  who insisted until very late in the game that the coronavirus wouldn’t be a problem  is now obsessed with the idea of reopening the economy in a few weeks — a move epidemiologists say would be disastrous. At the same time  he’s balking at taking action to help America cope with the extended shutdown we actually need. Thus  the Trump administration has flatly ruled out any bailout for the U.S. Postal Service  which is in financial crisis. Aside from being an essential part of our nation’s life — even more than usual in these times  when mail deliveries have become an essential lifeline to families sheltering at home — the post office employs 600 000 workers. But apparently those workers don’t count. Of course  Trump is famously hostile to the post office  because he believes (wrongly) that it subsidizes Amazon  whose founder  Jeff Bezos  owns The Washington Post. More broadly  further relief from the economic impacts of Covid-19 is stalled in the Senate because Republicans  with White House backing  refuse to include aid to hospitals and state governments. Hospitals obviously play a vital role in dealing with the pandemic; but they also employ more than five million people — and they’re facing financial crisis thanks to the pandemic. State and local governments  which in general are required to balance their budgets  have seen revenues plunge and expenses rise — and they employ almost 20 million people  a majority of them in education. But again  apparently those jobs don’t count. Actually  many conservatives probably believe that public-sector workers  many of them represented by unions  don’t or shouldn’t count. However  while the Trump administration refuses to aid hard-pressed institutions that employ around 25 million Americans  it has gone all-out to help the oil industry. Trump’s possible success in brokering a deal to cut global oil production — I say “possible” because oil prices haven’t moved much  which suggests that markets aren’t impressed — made headlines Monday. But I haven’t seen much commentary about just how strange it is for a U.S. president to be playing that role. First  since when is it the president’s job to organize international cartels? Second  why are higher oil prices in the U.S. national interest? We’re not a major oil exporter — in fact  we import more oil than we export. And if Trump’s cartel were actually successful in raising oil prices back to what they were before the current price war  U.S. consumers would pay a heavy price  on the order of $200 billion a year. So why is propping up oil prices a priority? Trump says that it’s about jobs. But U.S. oil and gas extraction employs only around 150 000 workers. That’s less than 1 percent of the number of jobs America has lost in the past three weeks. It’s only around 0.1 percent of total U.S. employment. It’s a rounding error compared with the jobs at risk in hospitals and local government  which Trump is refusing to help. So what makes oil worthy of aid when hospitals aren’t? One answer is that investors have sunk a lot of money into oil  even though few jobs were created. Net fixed assets in oil and gas extraction are around $1.8 trillion  almost twice the total for hospitals  despite far smaller employment. So maybe this isn’t about protecting jobs  it’s about protecting capital. And this capital happens to be very G.O.P.-friendly: The oil and gas sector makes big political contributions  almost 90 percent of them to Republicans. This is  by the way  in strong contrast to education  which accounts for a majority of state and local government jobs and gives most of its contributions to Democrats. Finally  while America isn’t a net oil exporter  Russia and Saudi Arabia are basically petrostates that export oil and almost nothing else. So propping up oil prices is a way for Trump to help his two favorite autocrats. In sum  Trump’s response to the economic fallout from Covid-19 is looking a lot like his fumbled response to the virus itself. He’s in denial about the problem; he’s blocking essential action because of personal political vendettas; and his party is opposing desperately needed aid because of its anti-government ideology. The economics of dealing with a pandemic were never going to be easy. But Trump and company are almost surely going to make things even worse than they had to be.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/tara-reade-joe-biden.html, opinion, What to Do With Tara Reade’s Allegation Against Joe Biden?, A sexual assault accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee is being used to troll the #MeToo movement., Supported by A sexual assault accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee is being used to troll the #MeToo movement. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist It would be easier to know what to do with Tara Reade’s accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her if her tale were more solid  or if it were less. In the past few days  The New York Times  The Washington Post and The Associated Press all reported on a story that’s been circulating through the left- and right-wing media for the last few weeks. Reade  a staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office in the early 1990s  is one of the women who last year spoke out about Biden’s handsiness. When The A.P. interviewed Reade last April  she said that Biden “rubbed her shoulders and neck” and “played with her hair.” She also told The Union  a California newspaper  last year that she didn’t feel sexualized. “She instead compared her experience to being a lamp ” the paper reported. She told the reporter  Alan Riquelmy: “‘It’s pretty. Set it over there.’ Then when it’s too bright  you throw it away.” But last month  in an interview with the left-wing podcast host Katie Halper  Reade added new  more serious details to her story  claiming that Biden pushed her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. (The Biden campaign has said  “This absolutely did not happen.”) Since Reade made her latest accusation  people on both the left and the right have been demanding  with a mix of genuine outrage and gotcha glee  that the Democratic Party live up to its #MeToo commitments and #BelieveTaraReade. “For Elite Democrats  Joe Biden’s Candidacy Means Ditching #MeToo ” said a headline in the socialist magazine Jacobin. “Joe Biden  Brett Kavanaugh and the #MeToo hypocrites ” said one in The New York Post. So must Democrats  for the sake of consistency  regard their presumptive presidential nominee as a sexual predator? As I’ve written repeatedly  I think Biden is a weak candidate  and I wouldn’t be unhappy if the Democratic Party were forced  by some last-minute emergency  to replace him  maybe with one of the Democratic governors who has shined in response to the coronavirus crisis. But  absent other accusations  that is not going to happen. Reade seems almost engineered in a lab to inspire skepticism in mainstream Democrats  both because her story keeps changing and because of her bizarre public worship of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness ” she wrote in a since-deleted 2018 Medium post. “His sensuous image projects his love for life  the embodiment of grace while facing adversity.” (Reade has since said her comments about Russia stemmed from a novel she was writing  though the Medium article is written as an op-ed essay.) In December she tweeted  with worrying grandiosity  “I worked for the Senate  I know the plan to bring Russia to its knees.” Reade’s account of giving up a career in politics  like her stories about Biden  has shifted over time. In 2018 she wrote that she left politics both because she wanted to pursue a life in the arts and because “I love Russia with all my heart” and could no longer abide American imperialism. Less than a year later she claimed she was forced out of Biden’s office after complaining about sexual harassment and was so scarred by the experience that she abandoned political work altogether. Let’s be clear: Reade could well be telling the truth now. It’s not implausible that she was afraid to admit what happened to her before  and so came up with an alternative narrative about her history. Plenty of people with wacky political views are victims of sexual assault. Indeed  I’d imagine that being sexually assaulted by a widely beloved mainstream politician would shatter one’s faith in the system and increase the appeal of fringe political ideas. A friend of Reade’s  who has remained anonymous  has told reporters that Reade confided in her about the assault at the time. That’s a meaningful piece of evidence. A confirmation by Reade’s brother is more complicated. According to The Washington Post  in a recent interview he told a reporter that Reade told him at the time “that Biden had behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders.” A few days later  he texted the reporter to say he now recalled Reade telling him that Biden had put his hands “under her clothes.” No one  looking at what’s been reported about Reade and Biden  can claim to have more than a hunch about what happened  which is why  I suspect  a lot of mainstream feminists haven’t said much about it. Writers on the left and the right purport to find their silence damning: So liberal feminists don’t “believe women” after all! There have been a number of sneering columns accusing liberal feminists of hypocrisy for not championing Reade as fervently as they did Christine Blasey Ford  who claimed  during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination fight  that he’d sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. It’s a sly rhetorical move that dares feminists to violate their own ideals by publicly weighing one woman’s credibility against another. The truth is  if Blasey had been so inconsistent in telling her story  feminists might still have believed her  but they likely wouldn’t have made her a cause célèbre  and Democrats on Capitol Hill never would have invited her to testify publicly. Advocates for victims of sexual harassment and assault would worry that using such an ambiguous case as a political weapon would undermine their cause. Personally  I’m just left with doubt: doubt about Biden and doubt about the charges against him. But the one thing I have little doubt about is the bad faith of those using this strange  sad story to hector feminists into pretending to a certainty they have no reason to feel.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/business/business-roundtable-coronavirus.html, business, Big Business Pledged Gentler Capitalism. It’s Not Happening in a Pandemic., C.E.O.s who signed a celebrated Business Roundtable document  promising to elevate worker interests  are now resorting to furloughs., Supported by analysis C.E.O.s who signed a celebrated Business Roundtable document  promising to elevate worker interests  are now resorting to furloughs. By Peter S. Goodman Last August  the chief executives of 181 of America’s largest corporations signed a document pledging their commitment to run their companies for the benefit of workers and communities  and not just for shareholders. Some pundits celebrated the statement from the Business Roundtable as a historical milestone  the moment when corporate executives demonstrated sensitivity to public anger over economic inequality. But others dismissed the document as a canny public relations move: So long as executive pay remained tied to stock prices  shareholder interest would remain supreme. Today  with the planet under assault from a pandemic that has delivered the most profound economic pain since the Great Depression  key signatories are furloughing employees  paying dividends to shareholders and provoking complaints from workers that they aren’t adequately protected from danger. Their actions expose the reality that the rhetoric of the Business Roundtable did not alter the decisive question of American capitalism — where the money goes. In the run-up to the crisis  many companies used cash to buy back their shares and pay out dividends  rewarding shareholders  while leaving themselves with fewer resources to aid workers when disaster struck. Take  for example  Marriott International  the world’s largest hotel chain  which last year earned $1.2 billion. It has begun furloughing most of its American workers  jeopardizing their access to health care  even as the company paid out more than $160 million in quarterly dividends and pursued a raise for its chief executive  Arne M. Sorenson. “They just say: ‘We don’t need you. You are on your own ’” said William Gonzalez  47  who was laid off last month from his job at an employee cafeteria at a Marriott hotel in San Francisco  leaving his family unable to pay rent. “The company has been making billions and billions of dollars  and a lot of that money doesn’t go to pay workers ” he added. “I thought there was going to be a moment where they say  ‘OK  we are going to help you.’” Mr. Sorenson  a co-chairman of the Business Roundtable’s task force on Covid-19  declined a request for an interview. A Marriott spokesman  Brendan F. McManus  said in an email that the chief executive was “unfortunately tied up and unavailable.” “The coronavirus pandemic has evolved dramatically in the last few weeks  and we continue to do our best to take care of associates  guests  owners and our business ” Mr. McManus said later in a statement. “We have now suspended all dividends.” The Business Roundtable declined to make executives available to discuss how signatories have responded to the crisis. In a statement  a spokeswoman  Jessica Boulanger  portrayed their efforts as consistent with their lofty aspirations. “The Covid-19 crisis has triggered an impressive demonstration by leading companies of their commitment to the long-term interests of all stakeholders ” she said. “Overwhelmingly  BRT members who remain financially able to do so are stepping up with voluntary measures to support their customers  employees  suppliers and communities during the crisis." Amazon  another signatory  has seen protests flare outside warehouses in several American cities  as workers complain that the company — valued at more than $1 trillion — has failed to provide protective gear like masks and hand sanitizers  exposing them to the virus. Amazon says it has ordered and distributed millions of masks  has been cleaning its facilities rigorously and has increased pay for hourly employees. “We are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable ” the company said in a statement  declining an interview request. Macy’s  the retail chain  which last year earned $564 million  has furloughed most of its workers  though it has continued to pay their health insurance. It distributed about $116 million in dividend payments to shareholders on April 1  while suspending subsequent dividends. “Unfortunately we don’t have anything to add ” a company spokesman  Blair Rosenberg  said in an email. “Any company paying dividends now in this situation  or paying bonuses to executives  that’s just clearly violating the norms that the Business Roundtable vowed ” said Lawrence Katz  a former chief economist at the Department of Labor and now a professor at Harvard. “It just seems both inappropriate and shortsighted.” Mr. Katz said it was too early to tell whether such conduct was representative of American business  but he described the Roundtable’s approach as fundamentally compromised by a reliance on unilateral action. The statement makes no mention of labor unions or other workers’ associations. The signatories commit to “investing in our employees” and “compensating them fairly and providing important benefits ” leaving it to corporate management to decide for itself how to follow through. “There’s a lot of lip service in that ” Mr. Katz said. Some signatories have moderated their cost-cutting to spare workers. Major banks  including Bank of America and Wells Fargo  have vowed to avoid layoffs  while JPMorgan Chase has promised to pay cash bonuses to employees earning less than $60 000 per year. Apple — whose balance sheet boasts more than $100 billion in cash — is paying employees and contract workers like janitors even as stores remain closed. Pepsi has bolstered sick pay while continuing to compensate workers who must stay home to tend to children. Many companies have suspended plans to purchase shares  among them AT&T  Best Buy and Delta Air Lines. But some signatories are responding to the downturn in ways that appear to undercut the spirit of their pledge. “Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity ” the statement declares. Sonia Bautista  43  was cleaning rooms full time at a Marriott luxury property in San Francisco  the Palace Hotel  earning $26.44 an hour. Her husband  Mr. Gonzalez  was taking home $20.30 an hour in his job at another Marriott. Together  their paychecks provided about $1 700 per week — enough to pay the rent on their apartment in South San Francisco  where they live with their 14-year-old son  Ricardo. Immigrants from El Salvador  they felt they had left behind the dangers and strife of that country to forge a stable life in the United States. But as the pandemic triggered a lockdown  their hours were cut. When Ms. Bautista received a letter telling her that she was being furloughed with 784 other hotel employees  she was devastated. She and Mr. Gonzalez secured unemployment insurance  but the first payments — about half their previous earnings — took three weeks to arrive. They fell behind on their rent. They ran balances on their credit cards to buy groceries. Her family health insurance policy was due to expire at the end of March. On Monday  her union  UNITE HERE  said it had made funds available to maintain her family’s coverage. Ms. Bautista cannot shake the sense that she delivered for her company only to be cast aside in her hour of desperation. “All the executives  Sorenson and the others  they get paid millions every year  and we just get a few dollars ” Ms. Bautista said. “We give our soul to give our best for our company. I try hard to make the rooms beautiful for guests so they will come back. It’s not fair. Marriott doesn’t care about us.” Given the scale of the pandemic and Marriott’s global presence — nearly 1.4 million hotel rooms spread across 7 349 properties worldwide — the company was uniquely exposed to the pullback. “For those large firms whose viability has been imperiled by the crisis in specific industries like air travel and hospitality  they’ve had excruciating choices to make  which they have done with caring and candor ” the Business Roundtable spokeswoman said. “None can support any of their stakeholders if there is no viable business on the other side of the crisis.” Over the last two years  while Marriott was recording profits of more than $3.1 billion  it spent more than $5 billion to buy shares of its stock. On March 19  Mr. Sorenson distributed a video message in which he said the pandemic was so destructive that it required the furloughing of workers. “In most markets  our business is already running 75 percent below normal levels ” he said. “There is simply nothing worse than telling highly valued associates  people who are the very heart of this company  that their roles are being impacted by events completely outside of their control ” he added. “I wish you good health and a sense of optimism.” Mr. Sorenson said he was forgoing his salary — $1.3 million annually — for the rest of the year  though he said nothing about his stock-based compensation  which exceeded $8 million last year  or the cash incentive plan that brought him $3.5 million  according to a company statement. Twelve days later  the company paid its scheduled dividend to shareholders. On April 8  Marriott filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission proposals that its board would present for approval at a meeting of shareholders next month. Among them: a 7.7 percent salary increase for the chief executive  plus a cash bonus of up to 200 percent. “Words on a paper are one thing ” said D. Taylor  international president of UNITE HERE  a union representing 300 000 workers in the gambling  hotel and food-service industries  including Marriott workers. “Actions in reality are another thing.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/business/13virus-bizroundtable-1/13virus-bizroundtable-1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-peter-s-goodman/author-peter-s-goodman-thumbLarge-v2.png 
13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/technology/coronavirus-virtual-haircut.html, technology, The Art (and Awkwardness) of a Virtual Haircut, My husband’s hair was looking shaggy. So were my bangs. A hairstylist came to our rescue — or did she? — over video chat., Supported by My husband’s hair was looking shaggy. So were my bangs. A hairstylist came to our rescue — or did she? — over video chat. By Erin Griffith SAN FRANCISCO — More than 20 days into San Francisco’s shelter-in-place orders  with hair salons and barbershops closed  I was resigned to growing out my bangs. But my husband  Matt  who had gone almost two months without a cut  began threatening to shave his head. For weeks  he had been trying to hide his floppy  overgrown strands in video calls by wearing large headphones and sitting back in the shadows. But those were only half measures. Hair does not care that we are sheltering in place for who knows how long. It just keeps growing. That’s when I learned about virtual haircuts. Caitlin Collentine  my hairstylist at Wabi Sabi Beauty  emailed with the offer. For $55  she said  she would walk us through the cut over a video call. It was not the most far-fetched service to attempt online reinvention since the coronavirus pandemic has spread in the United States. In the past week I have heard about a virtual Iron Man race  a virtual Easter egg hunt and virtual speed dating  while my colleagues have reported on virtual forest baths  backyard ultramarathons and “cloud clubbing.” Even plumbers in Ohio and Florida have virtually helped customers fix their own malfunctioning pipes. An amateur haircut with professional guidance sounded better than a bald husband. I signed up for a $20 bang trim  too. Part of me thought: How hard could it be? I imagined the haircut going so well that I would emerge from quarantine with another pandemic survival merit badge (see also: bread baking  Super Mario Odyssey playing). Perhaps we could become home haircut people. But the more realistic part of me expected to develop a deeper appreciation for the magic conjured by hair-cutting geniuses. Tales of “coronacuts” gone wrong have bubbled up on social media  with celebrities like Riz Ahmed and Pink sharing photos of their failed D.I.Y. attempts. “Anyone else do a #Stayhome haircut that got outta hand?” Mr. Ahmed recently wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of his freshly shaved head. If Matt’s virtual cut was a disaster  that would be him  too. The stakes were low. Our first challenge was securing electric clippers and hair scissors. Local stores were sold out and everywhere I looked online the items were unavailable for weeks. I should not have been surprised; the entire country is cutting its own hair. We borrowed a set from a friend (sanitized  with a contactless pickup and drop-off). The second challenge was not cutting my fingers. Ms. Collentine began our FaceTime call by taking pictures of Matt’s head from the front  side and back on a tablet  which she used as a reference. She showed me how to properly hold the clippers (a relaxed C-shaped hand  not my claw-shaped death grip) and pointed out where to shave on the photo of Matt’s head. That was the easy part. Because our clippers only came with clipper guards for longer hair  I had to do a lot more cutting with the comb and scissors. Hairstylists make wielding a comb and scissors look natural  but I found myself contorting my wrists and fingers into strange angles to get the right cuts. Matt was mostly amused by this  but I also picked up a hint of concern — especially anytime I said “Oops!” Watching and listening to Ms. Collentine’s directions while Matt watched me and chimed in felt a bit like learning to drive with both parents in the car. “Move the comb to the left a bit. The other left. Try holding it like this. More perpendicular. To his head. OK  cut that. Well  that’s OK  too. You’re doing great!” I asked Ms. Collentine if watching amateurs fumble around with scissors made her want to reach through the screen and do it herself. It could be “a little maddening ” she said. But it gave her a new appreciation for her skills. I suggested hairdressers and barbers charge at least triple for their first round of post-quarantine cuts. It’s basic supply and demand. At first  I trimmed the top section of Matt’s hair so carefully that one could barely notice the difference. Then I did it all over again with more confidence  much shorter. A few of my snips conveyed serious bowl cut vibes  but Ms. Collentine showed me how to artfully blend them in with a technique called point cuts. Hair  it turns out  is pretty forgiving. Increased confidence — knowing just enough to be dangerous — created its own challenges. As I snipped away faster and faster  feeling a bit like Edward Scissorhands  I eventually cut my fingers. Fortunately the scissors were too dull and cheap to hurt for long. The result  once Matt contributed his own styling  was a satisfactory improvement.

Ms. Collentine also helped me style my overgrown bangs into less ambitious  lower-maintenance side-swept bangs. After I parted  combed and trimmed  she examined the results and suggested adjustments. (A mirror would have been helpful for cutting my own hair  as it’s difficult to see what you’re doing in the small video screen.)

This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.

If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.

14/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/sports/basketball/coaching-clinics.html, sports basketball, There Are No Games. But Basketball Coaches Are Still Busy., Coaching clinics that were supposed to happen during the Final Four have instead become very popular online., Supported by Coaching clinics that were supposed to happen during the Final Four have instead become very popular online. By Adam Zagoria Oklahoma City Thunder Coach Billy Donovan invited about 1 000 people into his home recently while still practicing social distancing in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Through videoconferencing  Donovan  54  gave instruction for more than 80 minutes on the Coaches Clinic site  discussing his offensive philosophy and answering questions submitted to a moderator — all from the comfort of his home in Crescent Beach  Fla. Coaches routinely give such clinics  with U.S.A. Basketball  for example  holding an annual academy. But with the N.C.A.A. men’s and women’s tournaments canceled  the N.B.A. suspended and the W.N.B.A. postponed — and basketball coaches finding themselves with more spare time — they’re turning to virtual clinics and instruction. “Now that everybody’s home  it’s a great way to kind of connect ” said Donovan  whose Thunder were fifth in the Western Conference when the N.B.A. suspended play. “So I think everybody’s trying to get creative and look at different ways to utilize their time.” The sessions on Coaches Clinic began last month as an idea on Twitter  evolving into an online replacement for the Professional Development Series run by the National Association of Basketball Coaches each year at the men’s Final Four. The day the N.C.A.A. canceled the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments  Lason Perkins  the head boys’ basketball coach at Cary Academy in North Carolina  tweeted  “OK  who is up for having some online basketball discussions/clinics via Whereby or Google Hangouts over the next few weeks? Topics?” Perkins then contacted Wade Floyd  who had already established a site devoted to providing online courses in several sports. Next  Floyd reached out to Leigh Klein  the chief executive of the Five-Star Basketball Camp in New York  because of his vast contacts in the coaching world and his experience in moderating discussions. By March 16  Floyd had built out the Coaches Clinic site  with Klein moderating the clinics. “A community was formed to allow the growth to continue despite the ball stopping bouncing ” Klein said in a telephone interview. “Growth has happened in this medium with coaches sitting in front of the computer to learn about the game. And a variety of coaches have contributed to that.” The site held 258 basketball clinics from March 16 to April 4  Floyd said  for an average of about 13 per day. He provided data showing the site had more than 24 000 registered attendees  including coaches from Australia  Brazil  Israel  Spain and the Philippines. Speakers have included South Carolina’s Frank Martin  Penn State’s Pat Chambers  the W.N.B.A. champion coach Lin Dunn and the trainer Chris Johnson  who has worked with LeBron James  Dwyane Wade and Jimmy Butler. For the attendees  the clinics provide instruction on all aspects of basketball  including offensive and defensive techniques  running a program and handling time management.  Kellen Fernetti  the women’s basketball coach at Lamar Community College in Colorado  has already participated in about 10 sessions. “I have seen tons and taken notes ” Fernetti wrote in an email. “There is no doubt this has made me better during this difficult time. Every aspect of basketball has been covered  and what I like is every level of basketball has had coaches be a part of it.” The coaches see the clinics as a way to give back during this downtime. “Part of coaching  normally  is you value teams ” said Tim O’Toole  an associate head coach at Pittsburgh  who spent two seasons at Duke under Coach Mike Krzyzewski. “And one of the things that Coach K used to talk about all the time was great teams share energy. You share things. And here we are in this age of social distancing  which is so opposite of what we’re used to doing.” Both Coaches Clinic and SportsEdTV  a similar site  offer their services for free. SportsEdTV  which has featured talks from athletes like the former N.B.A. player Tim Hardaway  has seen a bump in traffic of about 18 to 20 percent since early March. By charging for lifetime access to all of the recordings  Coaches Clinics has also raised almost $30 000 for charities like Coaches vs. Cancer  the Jimmy V Foundation and Soldiers to Sidelines  Floyd said. Klein has devoted up to 10 hours a day moderating the talks but isn’t earning income from it. That didn’t stop him from lining up future moderating gigs with other sites. “My wife looks at me like I’m crazy ” he said. “It’s the type of thing you do it because I believe in why we’re doing it. And then we’ll see if from that  hey  maybe we can keep doing virtual free clinics.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/sports/coronavirus-nba-horse-basketball.html, sports, A Virtual HORSE Competition? B-O-R-I-N-G, A rather uneventful game of HORSE involving pro players  plus 100 straight volleys  baseball in Taiwan  and training for a Swedish soccer team., Supported by The day in (no) Sports A rather uneventful game of HORSE involving pro players  plus 100 straight volleys  baseball in Taiwan  and training for a Swedish soccer team. By Danielle Allentuck Current and former N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players competed in a virtual game of HORSE Sunday night on ESPN. The result? An air ball. When the competition was announced last week  sports fans were ecstatic to have something — anything — even resembling live basketball to watch. That excitement faded quickly as the competition dragged on. The videos  filmed by the players with their own cameras  were blurry  shaky and oftentimes awkwardly lagged. It was sometimes difficult for the viewer to tell if the shots  taken on the players’ home courts  even went in. Sound quality was poor  and it was hard to understand the players’ commentary. Few competitors tried trick shots  even though the main goal of HORSE is to complete a shot so difficult your competitor can’t match it. Allie Quigley of the Chicago Sky was an exception — she even made a shot sitting down. Her opponent  Chris Paul of the Oklahoma Thunder  couldn’t match it. The semifinal will be played Thursday. Chauncey Billups will face off against Mike Conley  and Zach LaVine will play Quigley. Andy Murray and his wife  Kim  have a challenge for tennis players: can you complete 100 straight volleys? The two failed the first time  but made it on their second try. They posted the video on Twitter  encouraging players and fans to try it themselves. The tennis world responded. Professionals like Novak Djokovic and his wife  Jelena  tried the challenge  and then asked for another competition. “We’re here  we’re available ” Djokovic said. “We have all the time in the world. This is the funnest part of the day.” It was a great chance for the young to show off their skills  and for the old to show that they still have it. And don’t forget about the pets  who always find a way to be included. No partner? No problem. One fan did the challenge alone by tossing the ball back and forth between his racket. Other fans adapted the challenge by using their cellphones instead of a racket.  Play ball! It’s opening day. Ah  the smell of freshly mown grass  the crack of ash on horsehide  the cries of the Cracker Jack sellers … sorry  we lost it there for a minute. Actually  the opening day to which we were referring is in Taiwan. Like basketball  baseball is back in Taiwan  where Covid-19 has been contained fairly successfully. The Uni Lions beat the Chinatrust Brothers on Sunday  4-1  in 11 innings  and more games are scheduled Tuesday  Wednesday and Thursday. There were no fans in attendance  but President Tsai Ing-wen and her cat were pictured watching the game on television. Both the men’s and women’s soccer leagues in Taiwan also got underway over the weekend. VICTOR MATHER Hammarby  a Swedish top-division soccer team  has resumed practicing. That would be exciting enough news for sports-starved fans  but making it all the more electrifying was the presence on Monday of the brilliant and colorful striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Ibrahimovic gets attention wherever he goes. And his presence with Hammarby started eyebrows rising and tongues wagging because of supposed friction between Ibrahimovic and his current team  A.C. Milan  which he joined in December after two years with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Could Hammarby  in his home country  be a final stop for the 38-year-old Ibrahimovic? Hammarby’s training sessions are being kept below the national limit of 50 people gathering in one place  although the excitement of Ibrahimovic’s presence might make it hard to keep a lid on the attendance. “Zlatan has been home in Stockholm with his family during the break  and felt he wanted to touch the ball again ” Jesper Jansson  Hammarby’s director of football  told the team’s website. “Of course  we were in favor of it  so he was here today and trained.” German teams are the highest profile so far to begin practicing  as a handful of leagues around the world start to creak back to life. And in another hopeful sign  the player transfer rumor mill seemed to be cranking up. The BBC reported that Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur was not for sale  and Galatasary in Turkey was said to be interested in one of the few players as flamboyant as Ibrahimovic  Mario Balotelli  now with Brescia in Italy.

By Joe Drape The organizers of the inaugural Saudi Cup  the world’s richest horse race  are withholding the $20 million in prize money while they investigate whether the winner  Maximum Security  was aided by performance-enhancing drugs. Last month  the trainer of the colt  Jason Servis  was among more than two dozen trainers  veterinarians and drug distributors accused  by federal prosecutors in the United States in a series of indictments  of secretly doping horses and cheating the betting public. Servis has pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit drug adulteration and misbranding. The colt’s owners  Gary and Mary West  were due to collect a $10 million check after Maximum Security held off a hard-charging Midnight Bisou to capture the Saudi Cup on Feb. 29 at King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia. On March 9  prosecutors announced the indictments. In a statement  the Jockey Club of Saudi Arabia acknowledged it had been investigating the allegations made in the indictments and said its work had been slowed by the restrictions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “J.C.S.A. is conducting its own investigation in respect of the allegations  and until that investigation is concluded  J.C.S.A. will withhold payment of prize money due to all connections of horses placed in prizewinning positions ” the statement said  also noting that all owners of horses in the race had been notified. The purse structure for the Saudi Cup called for paying $3.5 million to the runner-up  $2 million to the third-place finisher and $1.5 million to the fourth-place finisher. The rest of the field was to be paid from $1 million down to $200 000 for the 10th-place finisher. If Maximum Security were to be disqualified  or “taken down ” Midnight Bisou would pick up the $10 million and every other finisher would move up and collect a bigger check. “I agree it is appropriate for them to conduct their own investigation ” Gary West  one of the horse’s owners  wrote in an email. Last May  Maximum Security crossed the finish line first at the Kentucky Derby  only to be disqualified for almost knocking over a rival horse and slowing the momentum of others. Country House  a 65-1 shot  was named the winner. Maximum Security went on to win four of his next five races  including the Saudi Cup. Servis and Maximum Security have become favorites of horse racing enthusiasts largely because of what many thought was an unjust disqualification in America’s most famous race. According to the indictments  however  Maximum Security was given performance-enhancing drugs  as were nearly all the horses under Servis’s control. On Feb. 18  2019  according to one of the indictments  Servis alerted another trainer who has been indicted  Jorge Navarro  via text message  that a racing official was in the barn area near where they kept the prohibited drugs  joint blockers and blood builders. On the same day  Navarro was overheard on a call with another defendant  saying that he would otherwise have been caught “pumping and pumping and fuming” every horse that ran that day. On June 5  2019  Maximum Security was drug-tested at his barn at Monmouth Park  N.J.  as Servis was preparing him to run in the Pegasus Stakes. In a phone call intercepted by the authorities with one of his veterinarians  Kristian Rhein  Servis indicated that Maximum Security had received a shot of SGF-1000  a compounded drug aimed to enhance performance  the indictment said.

Deirdre O’Connell in Lucas Hnath’s “Dana H. ” at the Vineyard Theater.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Supported by By Ben Brantley and Jesse Green Given the indefinite postponement of the Tony Awards  we recently looked back on a Broadway season that ended prematurely and decided to distribute our own set of prizes. It seems only fair that we extend our discussion to Off Broadway — which  before its houses were also shuttered  provided some of the most original  powerful and prescient theater of the past year. BEN BRANTLEY So much of what we saw Off Broadway from last spring onward has stayed in my mind  Jesse — or  perhaps  I should say  it haunted me. In many of these productions  time seemed to be torn off its hinges  and the solid floor of what we think of as “normal life” to have cracked open. Who knew how apt a preface such works would provide for the rudderless world we now inhabit? JESSE GREEN “Rudderless” is exactly how a lot of these terrific plays (and a handful of musicals) wanted us to feel politically  existentially and even spiritually — I mean with actual ghosts. Above all  I’m thinking of Yaël Farber’s production of “Hamlet ” starring Ruth Negga  at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn. Its treatment of the supernatural was as simple and successful as any I’ve encountered. BRANTLEY Yes  time has rarely felt as “out of joint” in “Hamlet” as it did in this thrilling production from the Gate Theater in Dublin. Negga  an Irish-Ethiopian actress  played the prince as a sheltered  thin-skinned young man abruptly forced into acknowledging a world ruled by corruption and death. Farber conjured a sense of the other — or another — side behind the known universe. Negga’s extraordinary  multilayered performance was built on the outrage of a previously untested mind coming to terms with an awareness of that other realm. GREEN And Farber smartly staged most of the ghost scenes in the midst of the audience  so we had to do physical work — turning  hunting — to confirm our worst fears. Another play that actively destabilized our perception of a predictable world was Lucas Hnath’s “The Thin Place ” at Playwrights Horizons  about a medium who may be a fraud and a client who insists on believing her anyway. Weirdly  in the audience  I preferred to believe her  too. BRANTLEY Hnath is my nominee for playwright of the year  in terms of his ability to unsettle through unorthodox theatricality. That was true not only of “The Thin Place ” but also of his devastating “Dana H. ” an account of his mother’s abduction by a psychotic patient she had served as a chaplain. The text consisted entirely of interviews conducted with his mother  delivered by the actress Deirdre O’Connell (lip-syncing to the recorded material). And what initially seemed like a gimmick became a powerful instrument of dislocation. This was at the Vineyard Theater  which also presented the season’s other great work of destabilizing documentary theater  Tina Satter’s “Is This a Room.” GREEN In their uncanniness  these two plays seemed to create a shadow image of our eerie politics  without ever making a direct political statement. The man who abducts Dana in “Dana H.” is part of a white supremacist netherworld  and though she returns from it  she and we are changed. “Is This a Room” — a verbatim transcript of the FBI interrogation of the intelligence specialist Reality Winner — raises the specter of a coming police state. Or is it already here? BRANTLEY Emily Davis’s portrayal of Reality Winner captured the wrenching internal struggle that happens when we’re trying to pretend life is “normal” — that it’s not under threat and about to unravel — when of course the opposite is true. And at this point  I would like to declare Negga  O’Connell and Davis as tied for the best actress of the year  on or Off Broadway. GREEN No disrespect to performances on Broadway this season but  as usual  Off Broadway offers actors so much more range to explore  and in these cases with no loss of bravura opportunities. I was also stunned by Hannah Gadsby  whose uncategorizable “Douglas” — a stand-up act that was also a drama that was also a tirade — was not just a great turn but a beautifully crafted argument about sexual  neurological and physical difference. “I no longer believe that I am falling short of expectations ” Gadsby says in the show. “I believe it is those expectations that are falling short of my humanity.” BRANTLEY Gadsby is disruptive in a positive sense  in that she’s redefining all sorts of preconceptions  whether about genre or gender. This was a season that shook up expectations of what a play could be  as we’ve noted  but also of what a musical could be. (The high point among more conventional fare: Michael Mayer’s blissful production of “Little Shop of Horrors” starring Jonathan Groff.) I’m thinking of Michael R. Jackson’s “A Strange Loop ” an exercise in athletic navel gazing at Playwrights Horizons about a black  queer creator of musicals (like Jackson); and “Octet ” Dave Malloy’s extraordinary a cappella chamber opera at the Signature Theater  about a group of internet addicts gathered in an Alcoholics Anonymous-style assembly. Both shows were  for the most part  set in the shadowy  teeming interiors of isolated human minds. GREEN And both were about characters lost in worlds that at first seemed free but turned out to be prisons. What prescience! Usually we think of great new work as historical  tying together threads of recent social change. But in so many plays this season  authors seemed to predict what was coming next — or at least to question  often bitterly  the presumption of stability in the present. That’s why we saw so many ghosts: They are both warnings and reproaches. In Bess Wohl’s extraordinary “Make Believe ” at Second Stage Theater  the ghosts were the kind children make with white sheets but also the kind adults sense hovering around them  whispering that the world is not as safe as they were told it would be. BRANTLEY In Will Arbery’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning ” at Playwrights Horizons  those fears were shared by an unexpected cast of characters  who made your stereotypical Manhattan audience — i.e.  left-leaning  anti-Trump — question its assumptions about Americans on the right. The play gave us a gathering of spiritually minded  academic arch-conservatives contemplating their own crises of faith  with gripping dramatic conviction. And this  too  was a play that memorably made room for the numinous  the inexplicable. GREEN For most of that audience  “Heroes” was both an insight into a world we rarely think of without snark and a horror story about the backlash always threatening to rise from the graveyards of past battles. That theme was even more explicit in two plays that rethought the successes of gay liberation: “Dr. Ride’s American Beach House ” by Liza Birkenmeier  and “History of Violence ” based on an autobiographical novel by Édouard Louis. “Dr. Ride ” at Ars Nova  looked longingly at a moment (it’s set in 1983) before everyone had to choose sexual sides. And “Violence ” another St. Ann’s presentation  described in painful detail the way academic ideas about sexuality get twisted into an impossible knot by a real-world gay tryst that turns to rape. BRANTLEY “History of Violence ” with its self-made intellectual protagonist who came from a blinkered blue-collar background that he revisits in the course of the play  is also of course about class  and how it shapes prejudices  identity and  often  a paralyzing feeling of predeterminism. I found the same themes in a much more conventional  but equally energizing  portrait of a New York shelter for victims of abuse  Stephen Adly Guirgis’s “Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven ” at Atlantic Theater Company. GREEN No one gets the garrulous mess of life onstage like Guirgis  and with 18 rich characters  “Halfway Bitches” had even more life per minute spilling past the proscenium than usual. I left feeling wonderfully destabilized by his unbridled empathy. BRANTLEY While Guirgis wraps all his characters in a warm blanket of compassion  he doesn’t give them — or us — false hopes of an easier future. Might I bring up a play that is indeed set in the future  and also refuses to pander or reassure? That’s “Queens Row ” Richard Maxwell’s study of a dystopian United States  performed at the Kitchen. In it  three women describe the blasted  divided world they now inhabit. It should have been an unconditional downer. Yet it is Maxwell’s implicit contention  that where there’s life there’s  well  life. That in itself is something to celebrate. So is theater that can take on life  even in its darkest aspects  and make us see it more clearly. GREEN That’s a gift today. Or should I say yesterday? By forcing us into conversations with the unstable world we mostly prefer to ignore  these plays restore a kind of equilibrium that may also help us survive it.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/science/putin-russia-disinformation-health-coronavirus.html, science, Putin’s Long War Against American Science, A decade of health disinformation promoted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sown wide confusion  hurt major institutions and encouraged the spread of deadly illnesses., Supported by A decade of health disinformation promoted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sown wide confusion  hurt major institutions and encouraged the spread of deadly illnesses. By William J. Broad On Feb. 3  soon after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a global health emergency  an obscure Twitter account in Moscow began retweeting an American blog. It said the pathogen was a germ weapon designed to incapacitate and kill. The headline called the evidence “irrefutable” even though top scientists had already debunked that claim and declared the novel virus to be natural. As the pandemic has swept the globe  it has been accompanied by a dangerous surge of false information — an “infodemic ” according to the World Health Organization. Analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has played a principal role in the spread of false information as part of his wider effort to discredit the West and destroy his enemies from within. The House  the Senate and the nation’s intelligence agencies have typically focused on election meddling in their examinations of Mr. Putin’s long campaign. But the repercussions are wider. An investigation by The New York Times — involving scores of interviews as well as a review of scholarly papers  news reports  and Russian documents  tweets and TV shows — found that Mr. Putin has spread misinformation on issues of personal health for more than a decade. His agents have repeatedly planted and spread the idea that viral epidemics — including flu outbreaks  Ebola and now the coronavirus — were sown by American scientists. The disinformers have also sought to undermine faith in the safety of vaccines  a triumph of public health that Mr. Putin himself promotes at home. Moscow’s aim  experts say  is to portray American officials as downplaying the health alarms and thus posing serious threats to public safety. “It’s all about seeding lack of trust in government institutions ” Peter Pomerantsev  author of “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible ” a 2014 book on Kremlin disinformation  said in an interview. The Russian president has waged his long campaign by means of open media  secretive trolls and shadowy blogs that regularly cast American health officials as patronizing frauds. Of late  new stealth and sophistication have made his handiwork harder to see  track and fight. Even so  the State Department recently accused Russia of using thousands of social media accounts to spread coronavirus misinformation — including a conspiracy theory that the United States engineered the deadly pandemic. The Kremlin’s audience for open disinformation is surprisingly large. The YouTube videos of RT  Russia’s global television network  average one million views per day  “the highest among news outlets ” according to a U.S. intelligence report. Since the founding of the Russian network in 2005  its videos have received more than four billion views  analysts recently concluded. Because public interest in wellness and longevity runs high  health disinformation can have a disproportionally large social impact. Experts fear that it will foster public cynicism that erodes Washington’s influence as well as the core democratic value of relying on demonstrable facts as a basis for decision-making. “The accumulation of these operations over a long period of time will result in a major political impact ” Ladislav Bittman  a former Soviet bloc disinformation officer  said in explaining the Kremlin’s long-game rationale. Sandra C. Quinn  a professor of public health at the University of Maryland who has followed Mr. Putin’s vaccine scares for more than a half-decade  said the Russian president was drawing on an old playbook. “The difference now is the speed with which it spreads  and the denigration of the institutions that we rely on to understand the truth ” she said in an interview. “I think we’re in dangerous territory.” As a young man  Mr. Putin served in the K.G.B.  the Soviet Union’s main intelligence agency  from 1975 to 1991. He worked in foreign intelligence  which required its officers to spend a quarter of their time conceiving and implementing plans for sowing disinformation. What Mr. Putin accomplished is unclear. But public accounts show that he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel  and that his 16-year tenure coincided with a major K.G.B. operation to deflect attention from Moscow’s secret arsenal of biological weapons  which it built in contravention of a treaty signed with the United States in 1972. The K.G.B. campaign — which cast the deadly virus that causes AIDS as a racial weapon developed by the American military to kill black citizens — was wildly successful. By 1987  fake news stories had run in 25 languages and 80 countries  undermining American diplomacy  especially in Africa. After the Cold War  in 1992  the Russians admitted that the alarms were fraudulent. As Russia’s president and prime minister  Mr. Putin has embraced and expanded the playbook  linking any natural outbreak to American duplicity. Attacking the American health system  and faith in it  became a hallmark of his rule. At first  his main disseminator of fake news was Russia Today  which he founded in 2005 in Moscow; in 2008 it was renamed RT  obscuring its Russian origins. Early in 2009  a particularly virulent flu  named H1N1  swept the globe  and thousands of people died. That year  the network featured the conspiratorial views of Wayne Madsen  a regular contributor in Washington whom it described as an investigative journalist. In at least nine shows and text bulletins  Mr. Madsen characterized the deadly germ as bioengineered. “The world is actually fighting a man-made tragedy ” one bulletin declared. That June  Mr. Madsen told RT viewers that the virus makers had worked at a shadowy mix of laboratories  including the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick  in Frederick  Md. The institute’s official job is to help defend the United States against the kinds of pathogens that Mr. Madsen accused it of creating. In a follow-up show  Mr. Madsen said the virus had been spliced together from other flu strains  including the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic  and likened its creators to the mad scientists of “Jurassic Park ” the hit movie about resurrected dinosaurs. RT’s chyron for the show characterized the result as “Germ Warfare.” In 2010  the network founded a new arm  RT America  a few blocks from the White House. Mr. Madsen became a regular on-camera guest. In 2012 Mr. Putin added the military to his informational arsenal. His newly appointed head of the Russian Army  Gen. Valery Gerasimov  laid out a new doctrine of war that stressed public messaging as a means of stirring foreign dissent. That same year  a shadowy group of trolls in St. Petersburg began using Facebook  Twitter and Instagram to fire salvos of junk information at millions of Americans. The goals were to boost social polarization and damage the reputation of federal agencies. A rich opportunity arose in 2014 when Ebola swept West Africa. It was the worst-ever outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever  eventually claiming more than 10 000 lives. RT’s gallery of alleged criminals once again included the U.S. Army. The network profiled an accusation by Cyril Broderick  a former plant pathologist  who claimed in a Liberian newspaper article that the outbreak was an American plot to turn Africans into bioweapon guinea pigs  and cited the AIDS accusation as supporting evidence. The RT presenter noted that the United States was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to aid Ebola victims in Africa but added: “It can’t buy back the world’s trust.” The trolls in St. Petersburg amplified the claim on Twitter. The deadly virus “is government made ” one tweet declared. Another series of tweets called the microorganism “just a regular bio weapon.” The idea found an audience. The hip-hop artist Chris Brown echoed it in 2014  telling his 13 million Twitter followers  “I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control.” Mr. Putin’s campaign of health misinformation was now a global enterprise  with the creative energy of a fun house and the ability to strike anywhere. The next target was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the United States’ flagship public health agency. In late 2014  a rash of fake news reports falsely claimed that an Ebola victim in Liberia had been flown to Atlanta  starting a local outbreak. A YouTube video showed what it described as C.D.C. personnel  in hazmat suits  receiving and moving the patient in secret. The deceptive video included a truck bearing the logo of the Atlanta airport. A rush of tweets turned up the volume. “Panic here in ATL!!” one stated. Another exclaimed  “OMG! Ebola is everywhere!” As the Kremlin grew more confident  it began to simply recycle old narratives rather than wait for new epidemics to emerge. In 2017  Russian trolls used Twitter to give the AIDS falsehood new life. This time the claimed perpetrator was Dr. Robert Gallo  a scientist who in 1984 had actually helped discover the virus that causes AIDS. The tweets quoted him  falsely  as saying he had designed the pathogen to depopulate humanity. The trolls cited a website  World Truth. Its video attacking Dr. Gallo registered nearly four million views. Six researchers centered at the University of California  Los Angeles  found that  over decades  the false narratives around AIDS had fostered a “lack of trust” among African-Americans that kept many from seeking medical care. Their 2018 study  of hundreds of black men in Los Angeles who have sex with men  reported that nearly half the interviewees thought the virus responsible for AIDS had been manufactured. And more than one-fifth viewed people who take new protective drugs as “human guinea pigs for the government.” Within Russia  Mr. Putin has been a staunch proponent of vaccines. “I make sure I get my vaccinations in time  before the flu season starts ” he told listeners to a 2016 call-in show. At a televised meeting with doctors in St. Petersburg  in 2018  he scolded Russian parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids: “They endanger the lives of their own children.” Calling the issue “very important ” he warned of possible administrative steps to speed the pace of childhood immunizations. Last fall  Russia’s health authorities laid out expanded rules that require strict new adherence to protocols for childhood vaccination. At the same time  Mr. Putin has worked hard to encourage Americans to see vaccinations as dangerous and federal health officials as malevolent. The threat of autism is a regular theme of this anti-vaccine campaign. The C.D.C. has repeatedly ruled out the possibility that vaccinations lead to autism  as have many scientists and top journals. Nonetheless the false narrative has proliferated  spread by Russian trolls and media. Moreover  the disinformation has sought to implicate the C.D.C. in a cover-up. For years  tweets originating in St. Petersburg have claimed that the health agency muzzled a whistle-blower to hide evidence that vaccines cause autism  especially in male African-American infants. Medical experts have dismissed the allegation  but it reverberated. In a series of 2015 tweets  Russian trolls promoted a video of a black minister in Los Angeles addressing a rally. “They’re not just shooting us with guns ” he told the audience. “They’re killing us with needles.” The minister and accompanying text in the video claimed that childhood immunizations had caused autism in 200 000 black children. RT America echoed the charge. It focused on “Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe ” a 2016 film by Andrew Wakefield  a discredited anti-vaccine activist. When the film was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival after a public outcry  the network aired an interview with its creators. “Can we trust the C.D.C. on vaccines?” a plug for the show asked. Russian trolls fired off tweets containing links to the film and a fund-raising site for its promotion. One claimed that autism rates were about to skyrocket to “1 in 2” vaccinated children. Mr. Putin’s disinformation blitz has coincided with a drop in vaccination rates among children in the United States and a rise in measles  a disease once considered vanquished. The virus  especially in infants and young children  can cause fevers and brain damage. Last year  according to the C.D.C.  the United States had 1 282 new cases  a record in recent decades; of these  128 involved hospitalizations and 61 resulted in major complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. The Moscow site that retweeted the coronavirus blog in February belongs to a Russian news outlet called The Russophile. It is tauntingly bold. The author portrait on its Twitter page shows an unidentifiable soldier in green fatigues holding an orange tabby cat. The background image is a colorized Kremlin mosaic. The site calls itself a “news feed from free (= not owned by the globalist elite) media.” On the site’s About page  under the heading “Some more reasons for our existence ” is a quote attributed to President Abraham Lincoln: “You can fool some of the people all of the time  and all of the people some of the time  but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” The website lists its owner’s name as OOOKremlinTrolls and its street address as an imposing building next door to the offices of Lukoil  a Russian oil giant tied to Cambridge Analytica’s digital campaigns to sway American voters. “It’s a nice part of town ” Darren L. Linvill  a Clemson University expert who uncovered the retweets  said of the Russophile address. The site epitomizes the complicated nature of the new threat  parts of which have evolved to become more open  while others have grown stealthier. “It’s a cloud of Russian influencers ” said Dr. Linvill  a professor of communications who has studied millions of troll postings. The players  he said  probably include state actors  intelligence operatives  former RT staff members and the digital teams of Yevgeny Prigozhin  a secretive oligarch and confident of Mr. Putin’s who financed the St. Petersburg troll farm. The new brand of disinformation is subtler than the old. Dr. Linvill and his colleague Patrick L. Warren have argued that Mr. Putin’s new methodology seeks less to create than to curate — to retweet and amplify the existing American cacophony  raising the level of confusion and partisan discord. Much of the disinformation  like the Russophile site  lies hidden in plain sight. But other elements embody a new sophistication that makes it increasingly hard for tech companies to ferret out the interference of Russia  or any other country. Experts say that Russian trolls may even be paying Americans to post disinformation on their behalf  to better hide their digital fingerprints. On March 5  Lea Gabrielle  head of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center  which seeks to identify and fight disinformation  told a Senate hearing that Moscow had pounced on the coronavirus outbreak as a new opportunity to sow chaos and division — to “take advantage of a health crisis where people are terrified.” “The entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation has been engaged ” she reported. Her center’s analysts and partners  Ms. Gabrielle added  have found “Russian state proxy websites  official state media  as well as swarms of online false personas pushing out false narratives.” RT America dismissed the department’s charges  which were first made in February  as “loosely detailed.” In her March testimony  Ms. Gabrielle said that her center had intentionally made public few details and examples of the disinformation  so that adversaries could not decipher “our tradecraft ” presumably in an effort to foil countermeasures. Tass  the Russian news agency  reported that the Foreign Ministry firmly rejected the State Department’s charge. That response echoes an iron rule of disinformation. As Oleg Kalugin  a former K.G.B. general  put it in a video interview with The Times: “Deny  deny  deny — even if the truth is obvious.” Beijing now appears to be borrowing from Mr. Putin’s playbook  at least the early drafts. It recently declared that the coronavirus was devised by Washington as a designer weapon meant to cripple China. Mr. Putin has disseminated false and alarming health narratives not only about pathogens and vaccines but also about radio waves  bioengineered genes  industrial chemicals and other intangibles of modern life. The knotty topics often defy public understanding  making them ideal candidates for sowing confusion over what’s safe and dangerous. Analysts see an effort not only to undermine American officials but also to accomplish something more basic: to damage American science  a foundation of national prosperity. American researchers have won more than 100 Nobel Prizes since 2000  and Russians five. Geographically  Russia is the world’s largest country  but its economy is smaller than Italy’s. As Dr. Quinn of the University of Maryland put it  Mr. Putin’s salvos are targeting “the institutions that we rely on to understand the truth.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/00VIRUS-DISINFO1/00VIRUS-DISINFO1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
02/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/science/amber-mating-flies-australia.html, science, Scientists Find 2 Mating Flies Trapped in Prehistoric Amber, The discovery was part of a haul of unusual fossils recovered from sites across Australia and New Zealand., Supported by Trilobites The discovery was part of a haul of unusual fossils recovered from sites across Australia and New Zealand. By Lucas Joel Amber  or fossil tree resin  exists in rock layers all over the world. But for some reason  paleontologists never found much of it in Australia or New Zealand. That’s why it was exciting when Jeffrey Stilwell  a paleontologist at Monash University in Melbourne  and a group of students  found a stash in southern Australia in 2011. The find led Dr. Stilwell to mount a search for more amber at sites across Australia and New Zealand  with one of the specimens more unusual than all the rest: It contained two insects frozen in the act of mating. “I looked at the piece under the microscope  and when I looked at it  I said  ‘This looks really important  because it looks like they’re almost attached or something ’” he said. “I couldn’t believe it — it looks like they’re mating.” Dr. Stilwell and his colleagues detailed their findings in a paper published Thursday in Scientific Reports. Dr. Stilwell calls this “frozen behavior.” Such a thing is exceptionally rare in the fossil record  because it means absolutely nothing happened in the moments between when the flies were living and when they died and became entombed. It’s comparable to what happened to humans in 79 A.D. at Pompeii  when volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius smothered and froze some Romans in a flash. It’s possible that the flies are not in the precise position they were when they died — but they’re close. “It’s true and valid information ” said Victoria McCoy  a paleontologist at the University of Wisconsin  Milwaukee  who was not involved in the discovery. “It’s possible one fly was trapped in the amber and the other was a little excited and tried to mate.” The first amber samples the team found came from Australia’s Otway Basin  a site where Dr. Stilwell led students for research in May 2011. He did a double-take when they first stumbled upon the amber. “I started to see bits of gold  ‘clear gold ’ if you want to call it that ” said Dr. Stilwell. “I knew exactly what it was. I knew it was amber. I could not believe my eyes when I saw that.” He applied for funding from the Australian government to excavate the amber  and he and his research team went on to unearth a parade of amber-entombed creatures ranging in age from 230 million to 40 million years old. They discovered ants that are between 42 million and 40 million years old  which are the first fossil ants ever found in Australia  and which are part of a group of ants that’s still alive today. They discovered a cluster of spiders — though they don’t yet know what kinds of spiders they are — and they discovered mites as well as springtails that seem to preserve their original colors. The rock layers from which the in flagrante flies and the other creatures come from is made of coal  which  as the pressurized remains of ancient plant life  tells Dr. Stilwell and his team that the creatures lived somewhere that once teemed with plants — including the trees that smothered the animals in resin that then turned to amber. The oldest amber in the team’s haul comes from the Triassic Period  which stretched from 252 million to 201 million years ago. During that time  Earth’s separate land masses formed one supercontinent  Pangea. Australia and Antarctica  stitched together  comprised part of Pangea’s southern reaches  Gondwana. It eventually split from the supercontinent. That means the amber-entombed animals lived in what are today polar and subpolar latitudes  hinting at the environment that once prevailed on what was then a unified landmass. Why fossil-rich amber seems to be so rare from this part of our planet — discovered only now after more than a century of paleontologists working in places like Australia — remains to be seen. “It’s not clear if this is due to a lack of fieldwork in the Southern Hemisphere  or a lack of amber-producing forests ” Dr. McCoy said. More fieldwork could help resolve this  but for now  Dr. McCoy says  the next stage of the team’s discovery can begin: describing each of the animals in the amber specimens  which might include species from never-before-seen groups of animals. “We might see lineages that we never knew existed ” she said.

While significant  the cut falls far short of what is needed to bring oil production in line with demand., Supported by The deal will reduce output by 9.7 million barrels a day. While significant  the cut falls far short of what is needed to bring oil production in line with demand. By Clifford Krauss HOUSTON — Oil-producing nations on Sunday agreed to the largest production cut ever negotiated  in an unprecedented coordinated effort by Russia  Saudi Arabia and the United States to stabilize oil prices and  indirectly  global financial markets. Saudi Arabia and Russia typically take the lead in setting global production goals. But President Trump  facing a re-election campaign  a plunging economy and American oil companies struggling with collapsing prices  took the unusual step of getting involved after the two countries entered a price war a month ago. Mr. Trump had made an agreement a key priority. It was unclear  however  whether the cuts would be enough to bolster prices. Before the coronavirus crisis  100 million barrels of oil each day fueled global commerce  but demand is down about 35 percent. While significant  the cuts agreed to on Sunday still fall far short of what is needed to bring oil production in line with demand. The plan by OPEC  Russia and other allied producers in a group known as OPEC Plus will slash 9.7 million barrels a day in May and June  or close to 10 percent of the world’s output. While the planned cut is slightly smaller than a tentative pact reached last Thursday  the deal should bring some relief to struggling economies in the Middle East and Africa and global oil companies  including American firms that directly and indirectly employ 10 million workers. Analysts expect oil prices  which soared above $100 a barrel only six years ago  to remain below $40 for the foreseeable future. The American oil benchmark price was just over $23 a barrel on Sunday night. “This is at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy ” said Per Magnus Nysveen  head of analysis for Rystad Energy  a Norwegian consultancy. “The industry is too big to be let to fail.” The agreement reached on Sunday was the result of more than a week of telephone conversations involving Mr. Trump; the Saudi crown prince  Mohammed bin Salman; and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump praised the deal  saying on Twitter that it “will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States.” Negotiations hit a snag when Mexico refused to go along with an agreement fashioned by Russia and Saudi Arabia  saying it would cut just 100 000 barrels a day and not 400 000. Saudi Arabia strongly resisted Mexico’s position  worrying that if Mexico could balk others would follow. Mr. Trump supported President Andrés Manuel López Obrador  giving vague promises he would make up the difference  and helped coax the Saudis and Russians not to abandon the tentative agreement. It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration made a formal commitment to cut production in the United States  but with prices plummeting  many companies in the country have already reduced output. There is no international mechanism to strictly enforce such production agreements and cheating is common. Big oil nations that are not members of OPEC Plus  like Canada  Brazil and Norway  along with the United States  have been cutting production. The Energy Department has said that American oil production will fall by at least two million barrels a day by the end of the year. Other analysts say the eventual cut could be three million barrels a day out of the 13.3 million barrels a day produced at the beginning of the year. President Trump has expressed interest in buying oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to further reduce supplies. The oil crisis began a month ago when Russia refused to go along with cuts promoted by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers. In response  Saudi Arabia said it would increase production by three million barrels a day and flood the market. Oil prices and global stock markets fell sharply on the news. The Russian and Saudi reversal in the last few days was an acknowledgment that their gamble was causing self-inflicted economic wounds. “There were miscalculations on both sides ” said Ben Cahill  a senior energy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The Russians miscalculated how sharp the Saudi response would be and they might have been taken aback by how deep the price drop was.” The change in course should give a lifeline to American companies as they invest far less in exploration and production. “Hopefully  the American oil industry has avoided a worst-case scenario ” said Amy Myers Jaffe  an energy and Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “There still will be bankruptcies  but for the time being  the fears that there would be a wholesale destruction of the industry can now be put aside  because the worst of the price war has passed.” It is possible oil prices will sink again in the coming days if traders are not satisfied with the new cuts. In fact  on Thursday  the last day that oil futures traded  the price fell sharply even though a deal was close. “The agreement provides the expectation of stability ” Rene Ortiz  Ecuador’s energy minister and a former secretary general of OPEC  said in an interview on Sunday. “But whether the markets react accordingly is a different ballgame.” With the pandemic crushing economies around the world  few buyers were available in recent weeks to buy the cheap Saudi crude. The kingdom stored some oil in Egypt and was forced to let unsold crude sit in tankers along its coasts. The mounting glut became a threat to Saudi government finances. At a projected average price of $34 a barrel this year  Rystad Energy estimated the kingdom’s revenues would drop by 50 percent compared with 2019  a loss of $105 billion. Saudi Arabia still has foreign reserves of $500 billion  but that has shrunk from $740 billion in 2013. Several years of depressed oil prices had already forced the kingdom to borrow money and reduce energy subsidies for citizens. Prince Mohammed is now counting on his reserves to help diversify the Saudi economy for the future. Russia is in far better shape financially than Saudi Arabia  especially with a flexible exchange rate — as the ruble depreciates  the value of its exports rises. While it would also lose billions of dollars in revenues with the drop in oil prices  the government has a much lower fiscal deficit than Saudi Arabia and has $550 billion in foreign reserves. But Russia has other liabilities. It has limited processing capacity and its refineries have insufficient storage facilities. European demand has collapsed  and while China is still buying oil  at bargain prices  its storage will be filled up in another month or so  leaving Russian crude stranded. With thousands of Soviet-era oil and gas wells in western Siberia  Russia would have faced the prospect of shutting down and later turning back on wells that are costly to manage  and in the process might permanently limit the amount of oil recoverable in the future. Uncertainties abound for the industry as the pandemic disrupts global economies. Members of OPEC and their allies entered talks last week hoping that the United States  Canada and other Western producers would agree to explicit cuts  adding up to four million or five million barrels a day. Instead  American officials just made assurances that crude output would be reduced over time  on top of voluntary reductions that have already begun at some U.S. companies. The agreement announced on Sunday will taper into a 7.7-million-barrel-a-day cut from July to December and then to 5.8 million barrels a day from January 2021 to April 2022. American oil companies are already eliminating thousands of jobs  plugging old wells and decommissioning rigs and fracking equipment in preparation for the worst downturn in more than a generation. While American consumers are saving at the gas pump  oil-producing states like Texas  Oklahoma and North Dakota are expecting deep losses in jobs and tax revenue. Industry executives predict a wave of consolidation  in which small  indebted companies are either bought by larger ones or merge. “There will be some companies that won’t survive ” said Trent Latshaw  president of Latshaw Drilling  an oil service company active in Texas and Oklahoma. “But the industry in general will survive and come out of this stronger. We will have to make hard decisions  innovate and we’ll become smarter because of this.” The American industry was last shaken up in 2014  when Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies flooded the market with oil in an effort to undercut American shale producers who were grabbing market share from them. Prices crashed and hundreds of American companies went out of business  and 170 000 jobs were lost. While American production briefly dropped  it quickly recovered and grew. The coronavirus is a new and bigger challenge  and it was magnified last month when Russia and Saudi Arabia began their feud. Russian oil executives said they were tired of losing market share to American producers. Saudi Arabia retaliated by promising to pour more oil on the market  taking prices to roughly $20 a barrel for a time  less than half the level at the beginning of the year. But a complete free fall of oil prices into the single digits — something not seen in two decades — appears to have been avoided. President Trump’s recent public lobbying of Russia and Saudi Arabia to lower production helped raise prices several dollars a barrel  allowing many American companies to limit their losses. Energy experts acknowledged Mr. Trump’s role in the deal. “President Trump  who spent the last three years criticizing OPEC  became the de facto president of the producer group ” said Helima Croft  head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/business/13oil-print/merlin_165263190_b2cbee39-d392-4494-b54e-cdb279087d31-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/multimedia/author-clifford-krauss/author-clifford-krauss-thumbLarge.png

Some pregnant women have fallen extremely ill  but doctors are winning battles for their lives and their children’s. transcript This is Precious Anderson. She was pregnant. About two months before her due date  she had severe Covid-19. Actually so severe that her baby had to be delivered by C-section to try to save both of their lives. In fact  she couldn’t actually visit her baby. “Here you go  Precious.” And then it was amazing because we got to watch her video chat with a nurse who was with her baby  and Precious Anderson got to see her baby  David. “Wonderful  right?” “He’s so handsome  Precious. He’s very handsome.” We actually went to visit him and he was moving around  he was stretching  pointing his toes like a little dancer. He was so  so cute. Actually he tested negative for Covid. At this hospital  seven of the pregnant women who tested positive for Covid have given birth  and their babies have generally done very well. None of them have been confirmed to have Covid. I’m Sheri Fink. I’m a correspondent at The New York Times. For the past several weeks  Victor Blue  a photographer  and I have been able to spend time at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. And for the story published this week  we spent time with pregnant mothers on maternity and in the intensive care unit. Dr. Erroll Byer is the Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology. And he said that this moment  which should be such a joyful moment in a family’s life  bringing new life into the world  that  in fact  now it’s anxiety provoking. “How you doing?” What struck me was people doing the typical things you would do on a maternity ward  but doing them with masks  with face shields  with gloves  with gowns. Many  many of the staff members on the maternity ward and in the neonatal I.C.U. are out sick. So there is a level of fear. Basharrie McKenzie was also on the intensive care unit. And she’s pregnant  and she got very sick with Covid. She was so afraid. And of course  it’s really hard because you’re alone. You can’t have any visitors. When I met her this Monday  she was so much improved. “My three-year-old daughter keeps me going.” And she was able to continue her pregnancy. “Your respirations are pretty OK. OK? Very good.” So  there are a lot of very sad stories with Covid-19 — people in the intensive care unit — many  many of them not making it. So it was amazing to see this young woman  who had been so  so sick  was able to pack up her bags and actually go home. And she’s one of the success stories. “You made it. You’re telling a great story  honey.” “We’re proud.” “You got to have heart  and you had it. So we’re very proud of you.” “Thank you for allowing us to take care of you.” “Thank you.” I spoke with the intensive care unit doctors  and they said when people like Ms. McKenzie get to leave the hospital  get to come off a ventilator  out of an intensive care unit  and recover enough to go home that it’s giving them the energy to keep going. By Sheri Fink Photographs by Victor J. Blue The worried doctors stood together after their rounds  weighing the risks. A 31-year-old pregnant woman was in peril  her lungs ravaged by the coronavirus. If they delivered her baby now  it might reduce the strain on her body and help her recover. But it was more than two months before the due date  and the infant would probably have difficulty breathing  feeding and maintaining temperature and be at risk for long-term health problems. The surgery itself  a cesarean section  would be a stressor for the mother. In the end  the three obstetricians agreed: Neither the mother  on a ventilator  nor the child in her womb was getting enough oxygen  and the best chance to save both was to bring the baby into the world. Today. “We needed to do something ” said Dr. Erroll Byer Jr.  chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center  reflecting on that morning nearly two weeks ago. The woman  Precious Anderson  was one of three critically ill expectant mothers at the same time in the community hospital  an unusual circumstance. Dr. Byer walked back and forth between the maternity floor and the intensive care unit  checking on her. The obstetrics unit  which delivers about 2 600 babies a year  is typically a place of celebration and fulfilled hopes. But amid the pandemic  it has been transformed. Nearly 200 babies have arrived since the beginning of March  according to Dr. Byer. Twenty-nine pregnant or delivering women have had suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19  the disease caused by the virus. They have been kept separate from other patients  and medical workers wear protective clothing when attending to them. Hallways where women walked as they endured labor are empty  with the mothers-to-be confined to their rooms. Multiple doctors and nurses in the department have fallen ill. Even healthy pregnant women are anxious. “They don’t feel the happiness and joy that many people experience” at this time of life  Dr. Byer said. Worse  some pregnant patients who become sick are so scared of coming into the hospital — citing fear of the virus or of being alone — that they have delayed doing so. A few of them have become dangerously ill. As at other New York hospitals  the surge of new patients with Covid-19 flattened this past week. But the intensive care unit at the Brooklyn hospital had to keep expanding  to nearly three times its original size  and deaths remained high. Nearly 90 patients confirmed or suspected to have the virus had succumbed since March 1. From Monday to Friday last week alone  30 died. Five staff members have also died. The crisis is not over  Dr. Byer and other physicians warned. But he is grateful: So far  not one mother or baby has been lost. There have been no confirmed cases among newborns  though doctors are awaiting results for one  according to the chair of pediatrics  Dr. Noah Kondamudi. Ms. Anderson’s case has been particularly harrowing. She had been a patient of Dr. Byer’s for years. He counseled her on getting pregnant after a miscarriage and delivered her sister’s children. Day after day  as she struggled for survival  he kept asking himself: Is she going to lose the baby she tried so hard to have? Will her child be left motherless? During her ordeal  her mother  Doris Robinson  came to Dr. Byer’s office. “Do you think she’s going to make it?” she asked. “Please be real with me.” When Ms. Anderson  a substitute teacher  finally got pregnant  prenatal visits became a family affair. The baby’s father  David Cirilo  who works in security  and often Ms. Anderson’s mother  joined her to watch the ultrasound examinations. The baby was due in June. Dr. Byer was fond of his patient — “a beautiful personality ” he described her — who asked questions about her health and how she could address several issues  including obesity  that could affect her chances of getting pregnant. “She was very diligent ” he told a reporter. On Thursday  March 26  when she was feeling sick  she called Dr. Byer. He asked her to visit the obstetrics clinic  but she said she was frightened to come to the hospital. Besides  she told him  it was probably just her asthma acting up. A day later  she had little choice. She arrived at the hospital coughing and laboring to breathe  unable to get out a full sentence. Dr. Byer told her she probably had Covid-19 — “she was classic” — and admitted her to a special area of the labor and delivery unit  where four rooms at the end of a hallway had been designated for pregnant patients who were infected with the coronavirus or believed to be. By the next day  the maternity team was unable to keep her oxygen levels high enough  and she was transferred to the I.C.U. “She was just getting too short of breath ” said Dr. James Gasperino  the head of critical care. Within 24 hours  she was on a ventilator. “She tried for so many years  and now she’s finally pregnant and happy and things are going well  and it just happens that this pregnancy takes place with this epidemic ” Dr. Byer lamented. “Those are the things you have no control over.” Dr. Byer  51  is the son of an obstetrician-gynecologist with whom he delivered babies and operated many times  starting when he was a resident at the nearby Long Island College Hospital  where his father practiced. His mother is a nurse. One of his sisters is a midwife. His wife is a pharmacist. He studied at Howard and Syracuse Universities and has worked at the Brooklyn Hospital Center for 20 years. He was drawn by its academic programs  he said  and because he “liked being part of the community.” Growing up  he had attended a high school for a while near Fort Greene Park  just around the corner from the hospital. Dr. Byer wakes up at 5:30 a.m.  preparing for his day dealing with the coronavirus crisis. On his iPad  he checks what has happened overnight — looking at the websites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Johns Hopkins University and the New York Health Department to see if there are any new recommendations and assess whether the city is reaching its peak patient load. He keeps an eye on the data. Several small studies have been published about the coronavirus in pregnancy. Babies have been found to be infected in a small minority of cases  but have generally fared well. While some hospitals separate new mothers with Covid-19 from their infants  others  including the Brooklyn Hospital Center  allow mothers to be with their newborns and nurse them — the virus is not believed to be transmitted through breast milk. They are instructed to take precautions such as wearing masks and gowns and keeping their hands clean when having contact. Pregnant women are thought to be at a similar risk for severe illness from Covid-19 as other people. But Dr. Byer said that more research was needed  particularly in communities  like Brooklyn  where obesity  diabetes and hypertension are common among expectant mothers. Last Monday  three doctors in his unit were out sick. One tested negative for the virus and would be back soon. Dr. Byer and others discussed whether they had enough staffing and supplies  particularly protective equipment. “It’s this constant feeling: Is this shipment going to be enough for the next few days?” he said. “It’s really a day-to-day thing.” He had two operations that Monday: a planned C-section and assisting with surgery on a patient with a large mass in her abdomen. Before that he had rounds  on which all the cases in the obstetrics and gynecology service were discussed. One of the inpatients on the maternity floor with Covid-19 was Basharrie McKenzie  who had been on a ventilator in the intensive care unit  overlapping with Ms. Anderson and a woman who was 28 weeks pregnant and later recovered without an early delivery. Ms. McKenzie  36  was born in Jamaica and came to the United States as a teenager. She has three children and works in medical coding at another Brooklyn hospital  where she believes she picked up the virus. At first  she thought she had a cold. Her 11-year-old daughter brought her juice made from carrots and beets to treat it. Nearly three weeks ago  on a Tuesday  she was having trouble breathing. Like Ms. Anderson  she was prodded by her obstetrician to come to the hospital when she fell ill  about three months before her due date. The physician  Dr. Amber Ferrell  was alarmed when Ms. McKenzie called and was so short of breath she could barely speak. Dr. Ferrell alerted the intensive care team. Ms. McKenzie was admitted to the hospital and was scared to sleep for fear of never waking up. She watched staff members go in and out of the room next door for a patient she believes died. By that Friday  she had developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure — not enough oxygen was getting into her blood  which meant the same was true for her baby. She was put on a ventilator. A day later  drifting in and out of consciousness  she felt certain that the medical staff was trying to kill her. In a panic  she pulled out her breathing tube. The doctors decided to see if she could maintain her breathing off the ventilator. In Room 11 of the I.C.U. two days later  she saw a physician in a white coat  Dr. Gasperino  pass by and give her a thumbs-up. It gave her hope. She returned the gesture with two thumbs and a smile. But she was still breathing rapidly and had a tube under her nose delivering a high flow of oxygen. “I’m a little worried ” one of the I.C.U. doctors told Dr. Gasperino when the team gathered to review patients that morning. The physicians agreed to give Ms. McKenzie another day to improve in the I.C.U. Ms. McKenzie praised God  she later said. Her sister  a pastor in Toronto  asked for prayers to be said for her. Slowly  her condition improved. She eventually left the I.C.U.  where the great majority of Covid-19 patients have not survived  and was moved to a special isolated room in the maternity ward. Alone — no visitors were permitted except for women giving birth  who can have one — she kept herself occupied by browsing Instagram and FaceTiming with her children  including her 3-year-old  Aaliyah. It had been a tough year for the family  with four relatives dying in the previous six months. Last Monday night  Angela Lewis  a maternity nurse who has worked at the hospital for three decades  put on an N95 mask  a blue plastic gown  gloves  bootees and a face shield to enter Ms. McKenzie’s room. She said she had received no specialized training for caring for coronavirus patients. “Years ago  we were taught how to use the P.P.E. and the hand washing and everything. Covid is the same — you have to apply it. You just be a little bit more careful ” she said. “And pray  pray.” The nurse strapped a monitor around Ms. McKenzie’s belly. The sound of her baby’s heartbeat filled the small room. Ms. Lewis returned 30 minutes later  put on protective gear again and checked Ms. McKenzie’s vital signs. She was breathing without assistance. Her temperature was normal. “No contractions? No cramping?” the nurse asked. She folded up the printout of the baby’s heart rate. The next afternoon  Ms. McKenzie gathered her belongings. As she headed out of the unit to go home  one of about 80 coronavirus patients discharged last week  she caught sight of Dr. Byer and the nurses. Keena Samuels  the charge nurse of the maternity postpartum unit  said goodbye as Ms. McKenzie wept. “You’re going to be just fine ” Ms. Samuels said. “You’re going to come back and deliver a healthy  beautiful baby.” She added  “You made it!” In the I.C.U.  Precious Anderson’s condition was tenuous. “You’re seeing her not really getting significantly better  even though she’s intubated and ventilating  and we had to figure out what we could do ” Dr. Byer said. He conferred with two other doctors  specialists in both obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine. Continuing her pregnancy  they concluded  could further compromise her lung function. “I was thinking: ‘What more can we do? Is she going to see her baby?’” Dr. Byer recalled. The I.C.U. doctors also believed that delivering the baby might improve Ms. Anderson’s condition. “My gut feeling was that she would have more of her lungs to fight with ” Dr. Gasperino said. They prescribed two doses of steroid medications  given 12 hours apart  to help reduce the risk of breathing problems in her baby. At the I.C.U. morning report two weeks ago  a doctor presented her case: “She’s going to go for C-section.” The surgery took place around midday. Not long after she was wheeled in  Ms. Anderson became a mother. Her baby boy weighed 3.7 pounds. A team from the neonatal intensive care unit immediately began tending to him. He could not breathe well on his own and required a ventilator. Ms. Anderson  unconscious all the while  was taken back to the I.C.U. There was no significant improvement for days. Dr. Byer and Ms. Anderson’s family were deeply worried. “Because Covid is such a new and novel virus ” the doctor said  there is no way to know what the outcome will be in an individual patient  “even though you’ve tried everything you possibly could.” The I.C.U. staff received special approval to try the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir with Ms. Anderson  according to Dr. Gasperino. In a study of 58 severely ill patients published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine  the majority of those given the drug showed improvements  but there was no comparison group  so the significance was unclear. Last Monday afternoon  Dr. Byer went to see his patient in the I.C.U. “How’s Ms. Anderson doing?” he asked one of the critical care doctors. She no longer needed the ventilator  which had just been removed  he was told. “Very nice! ” the obstetrician responded. “Very  very nice.” When he stood outside Ms. Anderson’s room  she opened her eyes and patted her belly  as if she thought she was still pregnant. He gave the still-groggy patient a wave. He called her mother  Doris Robinson  to report the good news. “She knows she had a baby  right?” Ms. Robinson asked. Two days later  Ms. Anderson would tell Dr. Byer her baby’s name: David III  after his father. On a tablet  Dr. Byer connected her from the I.C.U. by video to the neonatal intensive care unit. The infant’s condition had been improving. “Oh!” Ms. Anderson said. “He’s asleep.” “He’s taking the bottle well  sucking well ” Mary Godineaux  the senior director of nursing for maternal-child health  said from the baby’s bedside. “He’s so handsome  Precious.” Ms. Anderson asked when he could go home  and Dr. Byer said he had to gain weight. Looking at her son  the new mother smiled and cried at the same time. “Hey ” she said. The child opened his eyes and wriggled. “There you go. Hi.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/multimedia/13virus-brooklyn-p1/12virus-brooklyn-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/multimedia/12virus-brooklyn-2/merlin_171448329_7fa4abd1-a07a-42fa-ba9f-c9b9ce8aae2d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Thomas Gibbons-Neff  Eric Schmitt  Helene Cooper and John Ismay WASHINGTON — The captain had reached a breaking point. The aircraft carrier he commanded  the Theodore Roosevelt  was docked in Guam as the coronavirus raced unchecked through its narrow corridors. The warship’s doctors estimated that more than 50 crew members would die  but Capt. Brett E. Crozier’s superiors were balking at what they considered his drastic request to evacuate nearly the entire ship. Captain Crozier was haunted by the Diamond Princess  a cruise ship of 2 600 passengers in individual cabins where the virus had killed eight people and infected more than 700. The situation on his ship had the potential to be far worse: nearly 5 000 sailors crammed in shared berths  sometimes stacked three high. Eight of his sailors with severe Covid-19 symptoms had already been evacuated to the Navy’s hospital in Guam. On March 30  after four days of rebuffs from his superiors  Captain Crozier sat down to compose an email. “Sailors don’t need to die ” he wrote to 20 other people  all Navy personnel in the Pacific  asking for help. A Naval Academy graduate with nearly 30 years of military service  the captain knew the email would most likely end his career  his friends said in interviews. The military prizes its chain of command  and the appropriate course would have been for the captain to continue to push his superiors for action. He hit “send” anyway. Three weeks later  the fired captain is battling the coronavirus himself  584 other crew members have tested positive and the acting Navy secretary has resigned. The secretary  Thomas B. Modly  removed the captain because he thought that was what President Trump wanted  officials said. Mr. Modly  the officials said  was keenly aware that his predecessor in the job had been fired after tangling with Mr. Trump. But in trying to please the president  Mr. Modly miscalculated and destroyed his own career. The story of the Theodore Roosevelt encapsulates  aboard a single aircraft carrier  Mr. Trump’s tumultuous three and a half years as commander in chief. The episode shows how the military  the most structured and hierarchical part of the government  has tried to adjust to an erratic president  and how in a hollowed-out leadership  acting secretaries have replaced those confirmed by the Senate. Early Monday  the Navy announced that a sailor assigned to the Roosevelt had died of complications stemming from the coronavirus  marking the first death of a crew member from the ship. The sailor had been admitted into intensive care at the naval hospital in Guam on April 9 after being found unconscious in bed. The Navy’s investigation into the entire episode is expected to be made public this week. This article is based on interviews with two dozen current and former Navy and Defense Department civilian and uniformed personnel  including Roosevelt crew members. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential meetings and discussions. Sailors aboard the Roosevelt most likely picked up the virus at a port call in Da Nang  Vietnam  on March 5 — just the second visit by an American aircraft carrier to that country since the end of the Vietnam War. At the time  16 coronavirus cases had been reported in Vietnam  all in the northern part of the country  far from Da Nang. The top Navy officer in the Pacific  Adm. Philip S. Davidson  ordered the long-scheduled visit to proceed as an important show of American military strength in a region increasingly unnerved by Beijing’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Da Nang’s piers are too small for a ship of the Roosevelt’s size to dock. So for its brief port call  it anchored offshore  relying on small boats to ferry the crew to the docks. Crew members posted pictures to social media of rooftop hotel pools and relaxation. One post said  “feelin vietnamazing.” On the fourth and final day in Da Nang  after dozens of sailors had spent at least one night in a hotel where two British nationals tested positive for the virus  the Roosevelt ordered some crew members back to the ship for fear they might be exposed. Those who had stayed at the hotel were immediately isolated. The Roosevelt went back out to sea  and its medical team watched closely for any sign of sickened sailors — a ticking clock during the 14-day period when symptoms would most likely appear. Over those same 14 days  aircraft flew on and off the ship  bringing in supplies from Japan and the Philippines. Then came the announcement over the shipwide loudspeakers at dawn on March 24 as the carrier steamed through the western Pacific. “Set River City 1 ” a voice ordered. The sailors knew something had happened. River City means Reduced Communications — no internet access or phone calls for most of the crew. Soon after  sailors posted outside the massive ship’s medical bays turned away crew members for anything that was not an emergency. Soon everyone knew: Three sailors had tested positive for the virus. The outbreak started in the reactor department  with its crew members responsible for running the very heart of the ship: the nuclear reactors. The three were flown from the ship to a Navy hospital in Guam. Two days later  on March 26  the Roosevelt docked in Guam. Covid-19 testing began for the entire crew. The argument between Captain Crozier and his superior aboard the ship  Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker  began. The Navy high command  including Mr. Modly  was also on alert back in Washington. Captain Crozier argued for evacuating nearly the entire crew. He wanted them quarantined and tested while the ship was professionally cleaned. A skeleton crew of 500 would remain aboard to operate the ship’s nuclear reactors  safeguard bombs and missiles and warplanes  and perform other essential duties. Admiral Baker  who as commander of the carrier strike group oversees the Roosevelt and seven other ships  countered that less drastic measures would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation. Mr. Modly and residents of Guam also expressed concerns that the island could not house all of the carrier’s crew if the order was given to evacuate  in particular if a growing number tested positive. The Navy considered alternatives  including sending the Roosevelt to Okinawa  Japan  or to San Diego. Another option was to leave 4 000 sailors aboard the ship and 1 000 in a base gymnasium on Guam  where they would sleep on cots several feet apart. But a first attempt at housing some of the crew at the gym quickly resulted in more cases of the virus. Back in Washington  Mr. Modly directed a top aide to contact Captain Crozier to ensure he was getting what he needed. The aide  Mr. Modly said later  reported that the captain was satisfied  “only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster.” But at this point  Captain Crozier was composing a four-page letter to be sent by unclassified email. In the recipient line  the header was bland: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC. The contents of the letter were not. “There are two end states T.R. could achieve ” Captain Crozier wrote. “We go to war with the force we have and fight sick.” In that situation  he wrote  “there will be losses to the virus.” Or  he wrote  the ship could try to “achieve a COVID-free T.R. ” with all the necessary evacuation. “As war is not imminent  we recommend pursuing the peace time end state ” Captain Crozier wrote. He showed the email to a handful of the most senior officers on the ship. They told him they wanted to sign it  too. Captain Crozier  fearing for their careers  told them no. Captain Crozier’s letter ran headlong into the administration’s narrative that it had everything under control. The next day  March 31  as Mr. Modly arrived in Los Angeles to visit the Navy hospital ship Mercy  an aide had some news for him. A copy of Captain Crozier’s letter  which had not been sent to Mr. Modly  had found its way to The San Francisco Chronicle presumably leaked by one of the 20 recipients. The letter was spreading rapidly to other news outlets as well. Mr. Modly was furious  although he restrained himself on a conference call with reporters the next day. “It’s disappointing to have him say that ” he told the reporters. “We’re doing everything we can.” Worried that Captain Crozier’s letter would anger Mr. Trump  Mr. Modly called colleagues asking for advice  officials said. Should he fire Captain Crozier? Most of them  including Adm. Michael M. Gilday  the chief of naval operations  and Gen. Mark A. Milley  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  told him he should order an investigation into the incident and wait and see the outcome. But Mr. Modly  a Naval Academy graduate and former Navy helicopter pilot who was hoping to become the permanent Navy secretary  was still worried about what the president wanted  officials said. Mr. Modly’s predecessor  Richard V. Spencer  was fired for opposing the president’s intervention in support of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher  a Navy SEAL charged with war crimes who became a darling of Mr. Trump. During a phone conversation with one adviser  Mr. Modly suddenly interrupted and said  according to a person familiar with the discussion  “Oh  breaking  the president wants him fired.” The person surmised that Mr. Modly had received a text message informing him of the president’s views. On April 2  Mr. Modly called Admiral Baker  Captain Crozier’s immediate boss on the Roosevelt  and asked him if he knew about the letter in advance. Admiral Baker said that he did not  and that he would have told Captain Crozier not to send it. As Mr. Modly explained in an interview he later gave to the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius  he decided to fire Captain Crozier after that conversation. Later that morning  Mr. Modly told Admiral Gilday  General Milley and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that he had decided to fire Captain Crozier even before an investigation was conducted. The three told him they would publicly support his decision  despite the reservations of General Milley and Admiral Gilday. Representative Adam Smith  the Washington Democrat who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee  condemned the move  as did three other Democrats on the panel. But they acknowledged that Captain Crozier might have mishandled the situation. “Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt ” the lawmakers said in a statement. “What’s more  we are very concerned about the chilling effect this dismissal will have on commanders throughout the Department of Defense.” The dismissal and subsequent investigation hit the ship’s medical department hard right away. The same day Captain Crozier walked off the ship for the last time  Adm. Robert P. Burke  the Navy’s second-highest admiral  called the senior medical officer aboard the carrier as part of his investigation. Admiral Burke criticized the doctor  saying he had failed as a leader. In interviews  two crew members said Admiral Burke’s tone was hostile. In an email  the Navy’s chief spokesman  Rear Adm. Charles W. Brown  said Admiral Burke “spoke with multiple individuals involved during the course of his investigation into the communication aboard U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and with the chain of command.” As Captain Crozier walked off his ship and down the gangway wearing a black backpack and baseball cap  hundreds of sailors and aircrew members showed up on the hangar bay to form a corridor for him. Videos of the crew cheering and shouting “Captain Crozier” immediately went viral. And that  Navy officials said  infuriated Mr. Modly. His next actions stunned Pentagon officials and effectively turned the crew of the Roosevelt even more solidly against him. Mr. Modly boarded a Gulfstream business jet at an airfield in suburban Washington and made the 35-hour round-trip flight to Guam  at a cost of $243 116.65  according to a Navy official  confirming a report in USA Today. When he landed  he spoke with Mr. Ignatius to defend himself. He also wrote a letter to The New York Times in which he again criticized the captain he had fired and who had  by now  tested positive for the coronavirus. Then he went to the Roosevelt and delivered a 15-minute diatribe over the ship’s loudspeakers berating the crew for cheering for its captain. He called Captain Crozier either “too naïve” or “too stupid” to command an aircraft carrier. He told the sailors they should never trust the media. He blamed China for the virus. Less than 30 minutes later  after taking no questions from the sailors  he was gone. Within another 30 minutes of his visit  audio of his remarks was being shared broadly across social media  complete with crew reaction. “What the…?” one sailor was heard saying when Mr. Modly called Captain Crozier “stupid.” Navy officials  inundated with calls from incredulous reporters  called Mr. Modly — now flying back from Guam — asking him to respond. He doubled down  issuing a statement that “I stand by every word I said.” By now  lawmakers were calling for him to be fired. So  too  were current and former military officials. “What he said to the crew  I just completely disagree with that ” Mike Mullen  a retired admiral who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama  said in an interview. “The content of it  how he said it  and actually  even that he was there on that ship to say it.” Mr. Modly’s plane landed at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Monday night. In a phone call  Mr. Esper told him that he had to apologize  Defense Department officials said. Seven hours after issuing his “I stand by every word I said” statement  Mr. Modly backpedaled. “I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid ” he said. “I think and always believed him to be the opposite.” But the damage had been done. The next day  Mr. Modly  now in isolation himself because of potential exposure to the virus during his trip to the ship  called Mr. Esper to offer his resignation. A spokesman for Mr. Modly did not respond to a request for comment. As for Captain Crozier  he remains alone in the “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam  battling a coronavirus infection. The 584 other crew members who have tested positive are also in quarantine on Guam  along with nearly 4 000 sailors who have been moved off the ship. One sailor with the virus remains in intensive care at the naval hospital on the island. Navy officials say the Roosevelt may be fully cleaned and ready to resume its operations in the Pacific this month. More than 345 000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate Captain Crozier  a step that Admiral Gilday did not rule out last week. Amid the fallout from Captain Crozier’s letter  senior military officials say they are concerned about other warships and other missions. “From my perspective  I think it’s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue ” Gen. John E. Hyten  the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  said on Thursday. “To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.” Three other carriers — the Ronald Reagan  the Carl Vinson and the Nimitz — have had sailors test positive  and the Navy is rushing to resolve their cases. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/coronavirus-biogen-boston-superspreader.html, us, How a Premier U.S. Drug Company Became a Virus ‘Super Spreader’, Biogen employees unwittingly spread the coronavirus from Massachusetts to Indiana  Tennessee and North Carolina., Supported by Biogen employees unwittingly spread the coronavirus from Massachusetts to Indiana  Tennessee and North Carolina. By Farah Stockman and Kim Barker BOSTON — On the first Monday in March  Michel Vounatsos  chief executive of the drug company Biogen  appeared in good spirits. The company’s new Alzheimer’s drug was showing promise after years of setbacks. Revenues had never been higher. Onstage at an elite health care conference in Boston  Mr. Vounatsos touted the drug’s “remarkable journey.” Asked if the coronavirus that was ravaging China would disrupt supply chains and upend the company’s big plans  Mr. Vounatsos said no. “So far  so good ” he said. But even as he spoke  the virus was already silently spreading among Biogen’s senior executives  who did not know they had been infected days earlier at the company’s annual leadership meeting. Biogen employees  most feeling healthy  boarded planes full of passengers. They drove home to their families. And they carried the virus to at least six states  the District of Columbia and three countries  outstripping the ability of local public health officials to trace the spread. The Biogen meeting was one of the earliest examples in the United States of what epidemiologists call “superspreading events” of Covid-19  where a small gathering of people leads to a huge number of infections. Unlike the most infamous clusters of cases stemming from a nursing home outside Seattle or a 40th birthday party in Connecticut  the Biogen cluster happened at a meeting of top health care professionals whose job it was to fight disease  not spread it. “The smartest people in health care and drug development — and they were completely oblivious to the biggest thing that was about to shatter their world ” said John Carroll  editor of Endpoints News  which covers the biotech industry. The official count of those sickened — 99  including employees and their contacts  according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health — includes only those who live in that state. The true number across the United States is certainly higher. The first two cases in Indiana were Biogen executives. So was the first known case in Tennessee  and six of the earliest cases in North Carolina. All the people outside Massachusetts whom The New York Times has connected to the cluster have recovered. But it’s impossible to say for certain whether anyone became gravely ill or died from the spread out of the conference. In hindsight  many people have criticized Biogen’s decision to continue with its leadership meeting in late February  which was attended by vice presidents from European countries already hit by the virus. Others in the industry fault Biogen for being too tight-lipped about the outbreak. At least two of the company’s senior executives have tested positive. Citing privacy concerns  the company has declined to name them  even as other chief executives in biotech have disclosed their positive tests. Responding to questions from The Times  Mr. Vounatsos refused to say even whether he had been tested for Covid-19. “He is completely focused on employee safety  supplying medicines to patients  and leading the company ” said a Biogen spokesman  David Caouette. “This takes precedence over his personal health status.” The company has defended its handling of the leadership meeting and its aftermath  saying it made the best decisions it could with the information available at the time. “For a company whose mission is to save lives  it was very difficult to see our colleagues and community directly affected by this disease ” Mr. Vounatsos said in his first public comments about what happened at Biogen. “We would never have knowingly put anyone at risk.” Founded in 1978 and based near Boston  Biogen helped pioneer the biotechnology industry  specializing in multiple sclerosis drugs. The company is best known now for its work on a promising treatment for Alzheimer’s. Its experimental drug was seen as a potential holy grail — until the company announced about a year ago that the drug appeared to be a failure in large-scale trials. Patients were devastated. The company’s stock nose-dived. But last fall  in a stunning reversal  Biogen announced that further analysis of the data suggested the drug actually worked at higher doses. Mr. Vounatsos said the company planned to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration “as soon as possible.” The stock soared; the company pulled in record annual revenues of about $14.4 billion. By the time of Biogen’s annual leadership meeting on Feb. 26 and 27  spirits were high. So was the pressure to deliver. Although some other companies canceled international meetings around that time  Biogen never discussed doing so. The outbreak was raging in China but had not yet been declared a worldwide pandemic. As of Feb. 21  the Friday before the meeting  the United States had only 30 confirmed cases  according to data compiled by The Times. Biogen executives in Germany  Switzerland and Italy — where there were just 20 known cases — packed their bags. On the first night  about 175 executives gathered for a buffet dinner and cocktails at the Marriott Long Wharf overlooking Boston Harbor. Colleagues who hadn’t seen each other in a year shook hands and vied for face time with bosses. Europeans gave customary kisses on both cheeks. “It’s unfortunately the perfect breeding ground for a virus ” said one former vice president  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his ties to Biogen. Two days later  the senior executives returned to their offices. One drove to a manufacturing center in North Carolina. Others flew back to Europe. Peter Bergethon  the head of digital and quantitative medicine at Biogen  went home to his wife  an infectious-disease doctor. A Biogen vice president in the Alzheimer’s franchise and her husband attended a party the following Saturday night at a friend’s home in Princeton  N.J.  with about 45 other people. They celebrated a holiday in the Greek Orthodox calendar  the end of the Carnival season  with special sweets and traditional dances that involved holding hands in a circle. Although celebrations in Greece had been canceled  the party in New Jersey went forward  since White House officials had just pronounced the virus in the United States to be under control. That night  Allana Taranto  a photographer who covered the leadership meeting for Biogen  celebrated her 42nd birthday with her boyfriend and another couple. Over that weekend  though  some people in the company had already started feeling sick. Jie Li  a 37-year-old biostatistician who worked on the Alzheimer’s drug team  had chills  a cough and aches. She was too junior to attend the company’s leadership conference  but her boss went  and showed up at the office afterward. On March 2  the following Monday  the company’s chief medical officer sent an email informing everyone who attended the leadership meeting that some people had fallen ill and telling them to contact a health care provider if they felt sick. “We moved quickly ” Mr. Caouette said. Still  that same day  the company’s four top executives attended a huge health care conference hosted by the investment firm Cowen. At another Marriott in Boston  they held meetings in hotel rooms with potential investors. Another attendee who met some of the same investors said he heard that members of the Biogen team looked sick. At the conference  concern about the coronavirus mounted as word spread that some companies  including Vertex and Seattle Genetics  had canceled their appearances. By Tuesday  the second day of the conference  many attendees had stopped shaking hands. Later  investors were informed that two of the four Biogen executives at the conference tested positive for the virus. In defense of his company’s decision to attend the event  Mr. Vounatsos said  “When we learned a number of our colleagues were ill  we did not know the cause was Covid-19.” That Tuesday  Biogen contacted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and reported that about 50 employees in the Boston area and overseas had flulike symptoms. Biogen employees began showing up at the emergency room of Massachusetts General Hospital  demanding tests. They were told their cases didn’t satisfy the testing criteria at the time  since none had traveled to a hot spot or had known exposure to someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. The next day  confirmation of the worst arrived. Two Biogen executives who had returned home to Germany and Switzerland  where tests were more widely available  had tested positive. On Thursday  the company held a call with its staff and shared the news. All office-based employees were directed to work from home. Yet on that same day  a Biogen executive visited the Washington office of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  or PhRMA  the industry’s top lobbying group. Soon after  that executive tested positive  prompting the group to close its headquarters for deep cleaning. The next few weeks turned into a blur of Biogen employees leaving casseroles on one another’s doorsteps and trading news about who had fallen ill. Dr. Bergethon infected his wife  the infectious-disease specialist. While their symptoms were manageable  the scariest part was the uncertainty  Dr. Bergethon recalled recently at a virtual event hosted by the University of Rochester. “We didn’t know we were going to recover ” he said. “We didn’t know what was coming next.” Ms. Taranto  the photographer who had been at Biogen’s leadership conference  unknowingly gave the illness to a friend at her birthday dinner. She had felt healthy at the time. Of the four dozen people who attended the party in New Jersey  at least 15 later tested positive  according to public health authorities. A Biogen executive  Chris Baumgartner  became the first Covid case in Tennessee. “I was patient zero ” he wrote on Facebook. He added: “Imagine having to confront a virus so feared  it now has the entire world on the brink of mass hysteria.” The earliest cases in Indiana and North Carolina were tied to the company. One Biogen employee even carried the virus back to China. After falling ill with flu-like symptoms  Ms. Li called an ambulance and was given a coronavirus test  according to a public health official in Belmont  the upscale Boston suburb where she lived. But before she received the results  she booked a flight to Beijing  boarding a plane with her husband and son  leaving behind their house  a white BMW and other trappings of the life they had built in the United States over 15 years. “They must have been desperate ” said Dr. William Q. Meeker  a statistics professor at Iowa State University who had worked closely with Ms. Li’s husband  Yili Hong  also a statistician. The couple worried most about their 2-year-old  who would be far from relatives if they both fell ill  according to a former graduate school classmate. Ms. Li took medicine to conceal her symptoms  and revealed her health condition to flight attendants on board the flight  Air China and Beijing disease control officials said last month. After she landed in China  authorities placed her under investigation for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases ” a crime that reportedly carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison. In Beijing  the couple suffered from high fevers and lung infections and were hospitalized  Dr. Meeker said. He recently received an email from Mr. Hong that said they were recuperating  but that their lives “will be different in the future.” It appears that all of Biogen’s employees who fell ill have recovered. Aside from Ms. Li  who was fired  all have returned to work  Mr. Caouette said. Biogen has since joined the fight against the virus. The company donated $10 million to expand access to testing and to provide emergency food and protective gear for hospital workers. Company officials said its struggle against the pandemic is just beginning: Biogen  for instance  has also entered into talks with Vir Technology about manufacturing a potential treatment for Covid-19  another pharmaceutical holy grail that could make untold amounts of money.

Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/us/00VIRUS-BIOGEN/00VIRUS-BIOGEN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty-privacy.html, us politics, The Coronavirus Class Divide: Space and Privacy, “Shelter in place” is a dictate that assumes the existence of shelter — the safe  stable  controlled environment that poor people often lack., Supported by “Shelter in place” is a dictate that assumes the existence of shelter — the safe  stable  controlled environment that poor people often lack. By Jason DeParle WASHINGTON — There are corners of America where social distancing is practiced with care  but the house in Robesonia  Pa.  that Mark Stokes shares with 10 other people is not among them. Housemates come and go to jobs in fast food and a chocolate factory  sharing a single shower. Dirty dishes crowd the kitchen that no one cleans. Lacking a bed  Mr. Stokes  a freshman at Kutztown University  sleeps on the floor in the room of a friend who took him in when the dorms closed. No stranger to hardship  Mr. Stokes  who spent part of high school living in a car  worries that the crowded conditions will expose him to coronavirus. But like many poor Americans  he says the sanctioned solution — six feet of physical space — is a luxury he cannot afford. “It’s just so many people in the house and there’s nothing I can do about it — it’s not my house ” he said  in a voice rising in distress. “You can’t be six feet apart when you have to rely on other people’s space.” With the pandemic exposing and compounding inequality in matters large and small  access to private  controllable space has emerged as a new class divide — more valuable than ever to those who have it and potentially fatal to those who do not. Inmates  farmworkers  detained immigrants  Native Americans and homeless families are among the discrete groups whose dilemmas have attracted notice. What they share may be little beyond poverty and one of its overlooked costs: the perils of proximity. In addition to heightened risk of contagion  close quarters can worsen a host of ills  from flared tempers to child abuse and domestic violence. “The pandemic is a reminder that privacy is at a premium among the poor — hard to find and extremely valuable ” said Stefanie DeLuca  a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University. “Living in crowded conditions not only increases the risk of infection but can also impose serious emotional and mental health costs. The ability to retreat into one’s own space is a way to cope with conflict  tension and anxiety.” After a youth plagued by foster care and homelessness  Mr. Stokes  20  had just arrived in college  where he was writing a paper on childhood trauma and savoring his private dorm space. Now living in a home with few rules — and none that he sets — reminds him of how much he misses having a stable family. “I’m really depressed ” he said. “Shelter in place” is a dictate that assumes the existence of shelter — the safe  stable  controlled environment that poor people often lack. Some are curled on friends’ couches. Some are looking after newly penned-up children in dilapidated homes. Many are dependent on public places — buses  laundromats  convenience stores  food banks  internet connections — at a time when the ability to stay home has never been more valuable. In Oklahoma City  Cathy Conner  58  shares a one-room trailer that lacks running water with her boyfriend and two relatives and showers in the bathroom of the R.V. park  after spraying it with bleach. Even the need for social distancing cannot keep her from the busy methadone clinic on which her abstention from heroin rests. “That’s more important than food ” she said. In Cincinnati  Freda Mason and her five children are sleeping on a friend’s living room floor — their fifth refuge in two years. “We been bouncing around from house to house ” she said. On Whidbey Island  Wash.  Gabby Sutton shares a four-bedroom shelter with six other homeless people — all of them in quarantine while one awaits the results of a coronavirus test. Worse than the fear of infection is the failure she feels for not providing a home for her 12-year-old twins  who are staying with relatives. “It’s really hard for me to deal with the fact that I can’t take care of my kids ” she said. Some poorly housed families describe their hardships in terms of physical discomfort or threat: showers without towels  sinks without soap  sleeping quarters without doors  coughs on public buses. Others simply say they miss the feeling of control — the ability to reign supreme over a six-foot radius. Emily Steinlight  a literary critic at the University of Pennsylvania  notes that the peril of proximity in the lives of the poor is a theme as old as the works of Charles Dickens. “All of his novels deal with the question of space as a luxury ” she said. “Bleak House ” the 1852 novel some consider Dickens’s best  even traces the class lines of an epidemic  revealing its two-sided logic: Its threat is universal  but its real-world damage concentrates on the poor. “It’s the poorest and most socially marginalized people in the novel who disproportionately die of this disease ” she said. “That also has resonance for what we’re seeing now.” Indeed it does. Among those disproportionately affected are the incarcerated  with outbreaks hitting the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City (more than 850 cases among inmates and staff)  the Cook County jail in Chicago (more than 350 cases)  and the Oakdale Federal Correctional facility in Louisiana (at least five inmate deaths). Mounting evidence also indicates the virus disproportionately hurts minorities  with data from New York City suggesting blacks and Latinos dying at twice the rate of whites. The share of poor families doubled up has been rising for at least two decades  said Hope Harvey  a Cornell University sociologist. After the Great Recession  researchers at the Census Bureau found 20 percent of children were living in shared households  including three-generation homes headed by grandparents. In urban areas  as many as half of children live in doubled-up housing by age 9. In a forthcoming article in the journal Social Problems  Ms. Harvey notes that such arrangements are frequently fraught with conflict and “hidden psychological costs ” as hosts resent the imposition and guests resent loss of control over matters like who comes and goes. “Not being able to control who enters your household would be particularly scary right now ” she said. Matthew Desmond  a Princeton sociologist who lived among low-income tenants in Milwaukee for his book “Evicted ” said substandard housing posed a threat to mental health even outside a pandemic. “It sends people a message — that their dignity and health aren’t important ” he said. In addition to having more stable space  the affluent often have greater latitude to remain inside it. They can work on Zoom  shop on Amazon and have gig workers deliver meals. Often lacking credit cards  computers or other conveniences of middle-class life  the needy are accustomed to errands and lines. “It’s not just the errands that poor people run  it’s the time the errands take ” Mr. Desmond said. “The world tends to be very capricious with poor people’s time. My fear is this will increase their risk of exposure.” Audreiona Smith-Parrow  a single mother in St. Louis  offers an example of what might be called the inconvenience tax. To economize on banking fees  she decided not to order checks. But that left her trekking to a convenience store last week in the middle of the pandemic  to get a money order to pay her rent (though she only had $35 of the $640 she owed). She wore a mask and carried three pairs of gloves and a bottle of Fabuloso. “It was really nerve-wrecking ” she said  since her daughter has a compromised immune system. “But I wanted them” — the apartment managers — “to see that I was trying.” Ms. Mason  the Cincinnati mother of five  took several buses in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the W-2 she needed to claim a tax refund. “That’s part of being homeless — you don’t get your mail ” she said. Lacking the money and storage space to buy in bulk  she also made frequent trips to grocery and convenience stores. Her travels — and the risk they posed of bringing the virus into the household — bothered the friend who took her in. “But I got to do what I got to do ” Ms. Mason said. “I’m more worried about getting myself back on track.” The reasons poor people ignore social distancing also include the most basic: the need for a paycheck. Before she was quarantined  Ms. Sutton continued to leave the Whidbey Island homeless shelter for her job cleaning houses. “I’m concerned about getting the virus  but I’m trying to get my own house ” she said. Unstable in the best of times  doubled-up housing may be even more vulnerable to conflict during a pandemic  when closed schools keep homes crowded with children all day and fears of infection add new layers of anxiety. “Family homelessness has always been unsafe and unstable — now the risks are even higher ” said Barbara Duffield  the director of SchoolHouse Connection  a nonprofit group that tries to improve homeless children’s education. In a coronavirus relief law passed last month  Congress provided a temporary moratorium on some evictions and $4 billion to help shelter the homeless. Since infection rates among children appear to be low  the pandemic is often described as a blight that is sparing the young. But the social risks inherent in crowded housing may suggest the opposite. Research on the 2008 recession found evidence that rising foreclosures led to increased child abuse. And with schools closed  there is less monitoring. “People have been saying  ‘Oh  coronavirus doesn’t affect kids — the kids are all right ’” said Bruce Lesley  the president of First Focus on Children  an advocacy group. “They’re so not. They’re at greater risk of sexual assault  suicide  substance abuse  hunger — every aspect of children’s lives is being impacted.” For Mr. Stokes  the Kutztown student  the pandemic has intensified feelings of trauma he was struggling to overcome. After a stint of foster care at age 3  he attended nine schools in 12 years  while suffering from an anxiety disorder. Estranged from his mother at 17  he spent half his senior year of high school living in a friend’s car. Despite it all  in January he made it to a four-year college  a source not only of pride but stable housing. “I felt  ‘I don’t have rely on anybody — I got a dorm  I got a 24/7 dining hall  I’m good ’” he said. With hopes of becoming a marriage and family therapist  he chose his first research topic: “How does childhood trauma affect educational success?” Within two months  he was homeless again. A high school friend offered him a place at her mother’s house  though space is so limited he shares a room with her and her toddler. (They get the mattress; he gets the floor.) With no closet or dresser  he piles his clothes in a trash bag in the corner — an image of dispossession he finds especially upsetting. The 11 occupants  who share two toilets and one shower  include his friend’s siblings and cousin and their girlfriends. “Everybody’s coming and going out of the house. No one washes their hands ” he said. “I’m worried they could just give anybody the virus.” Worse than his fear of the virus is his feeling of lost control  over his surroundings and his future. “I feel powerless ” he said. “All my life  I’ve been hopping from place to place  moving. It’s like I’m some kind of bum.” When he needs space  Mr. Stokes sits in his car and watches videos. Or he soothes himself by repeating what his calls the “I am” statements he found on the internet. “I am rich.” “I am strong.” “I am a part of God.” “I like to listen to things like that ” he said.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/nyregion/schools-cuomo-de-blasio-nyc-coronavirus.html, nyregion, De Blasio Used Last-Minute Text to Tell Cuomo Schools Would Stay Shut, The governor and mayor  who have long had a combative relationship  can’t seem to make peace during the biggest crisis of their careers., Supported by The governor and mayor  who have long had a combative relationship  can’t seem to make peace during the biggest crisis of their careers. By Jesse McKinley  Eliza Shapiro and Jeffery C. Mays ALBANY  N.Y. — Late on Friday  Mayor Bill de Blasio made the momentous decision to keep New York City’s 1 800 public schools closed through the end of June. He told just a select few  including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the country’s top infectious disease expert  who gave his blessing. But Mr. de Blasio did not reach out to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  his fellow Democrat and frequent political foe  until Saturday morning. The mayor’s top aides said he called Mr. Cuomo just a few minutes before he was to announce the news to the public. Mr. de Blasio did not get through. So the mayor sent a text message. Less than three hours later  Mr. Cuomo used his news briefing to discount the mayor’s decision as a mere “opinion” and insisted that he  and not Mr. de Blasio  controlled the destiny of the city’s own school system  the nation’s largest. The episode was a glaring example of the persistent dysfunction between the two men  an often small-bore turf war that now has surfaced during an urgent crisis in which nearly 800 New Yorkers are dying daily  adding to uncertainty over when and how the city will reopen. The disagreement between the mayor and governor frustrated and confused parents  teachers and other school employees  many of whom have scrambled to adapt to the extraordinary challenge that online learning has created and have been anxious for news about the rest of the school year. It also exasperated union leaders and some public officials  including Eric Adams  the Brooklyn borough president and Democratic mayoral candidate  who said the argument over whose authority it was to close schools should not play out “in the middle of a deadly pandemic.” His advice  issued on Twitter  was blunt: “Cut the crap.” On Sunday  Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio seemed slightly less confrontational about the issue. The mayor said he had spoken to the governor  and framed the schools’ closing decision as “not a legal or jurisdictional question. This is a moral question.” Mr. Cuomo continued to press his case that the status of schools should take into account when the broader society will be functioning in the entire New York City region  though it appears highly unlikely that Mr. Cuomo will reopen the city’s schools before September. Mr. Cuomo’s office says his authority stems from an executive order from last month requiring that public schools in the state close  with language allowing the governor to decide the length of the closures. But the governor did not sound hopeful on Sunday that there would be a quick détente with the mayor. “We are where we were ” he said. Where that is  exactly  may not be of great comfort to New Yorkers. The two leaders have been squabbling over the power to take action in New York City since the early months of Mr. de Blasio’s tenure as mayor in 2014. Back then  they fought over funding for Mr. de Blasio’s signature initiative  universal prekindergarten. The mayor planned to fund the major project with a tax on wealthy New Yorkers  but Mr. Cuomo shot down that idea  though he provided $300 million in other funding. Even an abbreviated list of their spats seems lengthy: There was the time Mr. Cuomo shut down the city’s subways in a snowstorm  without first telling Mr. de Blasio  or the time when they fought over whether to euthanize a single deer in Harlem. On more serious issues  Mr. Cuomo has overruled the city on a ban on plastic bags  enforced his will on subway repairs and recently demanded the de Blasio administration rein in Medicaid costs. The sniping has continued during the coronavirus outbreak. In mid-March  Mr. de Blasio began calling for a shelter-in-place order  similar to an order that had been issued in the Bay Area. Mr. Cuomo chafed at the mayor’s suggestion  saying he disliked the phrase  before unveiling — several days later — what was in effect a shelter-in-place order by another name: New York State on Pause. Other mixed messages have included Mr. de Blasio’s call in early April for city residents to wear face coverings in public; Mr. Cuomo  who has not worn a mask in public  suggested such a move might engender “a false sense of security.” (On Sunday  Mr. Cuomo announced an order to employers to provide masks to any worker interacting with the public.) The two men have also differed on the timing of closing of city playgrounds and the cancellation of elective surgery. On Saturday  their grievances had spilled over into the lives of untold numbers of parents  teachers and other school employees  all suffering whiplash from their contradictory pronouncements. “Keeping school buildings closed is the right decision — regardless of who is responsible ” said Michael Mulgrew  president of the city’s teachers union. That sentiment was echoed by Mark Cannizzaro  president of the union for principals  who called the day “very unfortunate” and said it had “led to some confusion among members and families.” Robin Broshi  who lives in Manhattan and is a mother of two public school students  said “emails were flying” all day Saturday among parents who were trying to make sense of the competing announcements. Some posted on Facebook  seeking more information from peers. “It was very disappointing but very on brand that even in a crisis of this magnitude they couldn’t get on the same page ” Ms. Broshi said. Rebecca Katz  a former senior aide for Mr. de Blasio who has been critical of both the mayor and Mr. Cuomo  said the governor had “done an excellent job communicating throughout this crisis” but that his dealings with the mayor revealed a stubborn character flaw. “His biggest weakness is his lack of self-control when it comes to taking pot shots at de Blasio ” she said. The schism between the governor and the mayor is so pronounced that the two men have not appeared on the same stage since March 2  a day after the first case of coronavirus in the state — a woman from Manhattan who had traveled to Iran — was announced. Mr. Cuomo’s actions had the effect of putting the mayor’s leadership into question  said city officials. One reason City Hall officials gave Mr. Cuomo’s staff such short notice of the decision to close schools was that they were worried that he would once again contradict or subvert them. “He’s concerned about being made to look ineffectual ” said one person familiar with the mayor’s decision-making process. The lack of coordination with Mr. de Blasio was probably jarring for the live national television audience now tuning in regularly to see Mr. Cuomo  who has struck a more beneficent tone in his daily briefings  praising adversaries like President Trump and scolding those seeking to politicize coronavirus. Indeed  just moments before he rebuffed the mayor  Mr. Cuomo had said  “We’ve kept politics out of this crisis.” ”I’ve worked very hard to do that  I’ve worked very hard to keep myself out of the politics ” Mr. Cuomo said on Saturday. “I have no personal politics.” Such a statement  of course  probably provoked guffaws in certain quarters in Albany  where the governor’s taste for political combat — particularly with Mr. de Blasio — is as well known as his fondness for muscle cars. (He pulled up at a Sunday morning event in his vintage Pontiac GTO.) Still  while Mr. Cuomo has basked in positive reviews about his steady and sympathetic response to the contagion  Mr. de Blasio has fielded persistent questions about whether his deliberate decision-making process has hampered the city’s coronavirus response. Top city health officials threatened to resign when the mayor hesitated to close schools  bars and restaurants. Mr. de Blasio has seemingly taken notes from Mr. Cuomo’s approach to the president  tamping down his politically charged rhetoric  even thanking Mr. Trump  whom he has previously accused of betraying the city he grew up in. At the same time  he has moved his own daily briefings from late afternoon to the morning  conveniently positioned just before the governor’s news conferences typically take place. It was just such timing that resulted in the discordant messages on Saturday. Shortly before 9:30 a.m.  when Mr. de Blasio announced that New York City’s public schools would remain closed  senior aides to the mayor and governor communicated about the move. The governor’s office said that while they knew that Mr. de Blasio wanted to discuss the issue of school closure  they said that it was not made clear that the mayor would imminently announce that city schools would be shuttered through June. Freddi Goldstein  the mayor’s press secretary  disputed that assertion  saying that the mayor made clear his intent to keep schools closed. In any case  the governor’s office maintained that such short notice did not allow for such a major policy move to be seriously discussed or refined. And the governor was not pleased. City officials say that officials from Mr. Cuomo’s office contacted them in the middle of the mayor’s news conference. “They said we couldn’t do it on our own ” said one city official who added that the governor’s office said that the decision was “not coordinated.” Mr. Cuomo then made clear that the decision to close or reopen city schools could not be done “without coordinating that decision with the whole metropolitan region.” Asked if the mayor’s announcement on schools was invalid  the governor was blunt. “He didn’t close them ” Mr. Cuomo said. “And he can’t open them.” Mr. de Blasio’s communication director  Wiley Norvell  soon shot back on Twitter  suggesting the governor’s actions were about “politics or machismo ” and citing the opinion of health experts that schools should remain closed. “It’s about what’s best for kids and parents ” Mr. Norvell said. Ms. Goldstein followed suit  writing on Twitter that Mr. de Blasio had been proven correct in calling for a shelter in place over the governor’s initial objections. “Schools will remain closed  just like how we eventually — days later — moved to a shelter in place model.” Dani Lever  the governor’s communications director  said that the state’s “decisions are not based on politics but based on data and science ” adding that they “will continue to be made on a regional basis which is acknowledged by all experts as the best governmental policy.” By Easter Sunday  both men — perhaps moved by the holiday spirit  or just wary of bad press — were striking less noxious tones. “I don’t think if you literally look over the whole course of this thing  you are going to find very many times where there was substantial disagreement ” Mr. de Blasio said. “You are going to find on a vast  vast majority of the moves that were made  agreement on the nature of the timing of what was done.” About two hours later  when Mr. Cuomo’s daily news conference went live  the governor also offered a more gentle analysis about the challenges of working with local governments  including New York City’s. “Sometimes ” he said  “it’s less coordinated than we would like.” J.

Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.

Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.

And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room.

11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-n95-mask-decontaminating-reuse.html, business, Where Thousands of Masks a Day Are Decontaminated to Battle the Virus, , N95 masks and other protective equipment being decontaminated inside the critical care decontamination system designed by Battelle.Credit...By Brian Kaiser Supported by Photographs and Video by Brian Kaiser Text by Tiffany Hsu Inside the rural Ohio labs run by Battelle  a nonprofit research and development firm  scientists have tested explosives  experimented with atomic energy and worked with chemical nerve agents. But some of the group’s most critical work is now happening outside  in a parking lot. Under a sprawling tent near the small town of West Jefferson  employees have spent the recent weeks decontaminating over 30 000 used face masks for doctors and nurses on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Each day  N95 masks collected from more than 100 hospitals  clinics  fire departments and nursing homes are treated for hours with a hydrogen peroxide vapor. Once cleaned  the masks are sent back to the same facilities to be reused. A severe shortage of personal protective equipment has left hospitals desperate as the outbreak continues to spread. Automakers  fashion designers  furniture manufacturers  tech companies and other organizations have in recent weeks been rushing to manufacture and distribute new masks — part of a growing and improvised effort to increase the supply. For Battelle  which usually develops products across a range of disciplines  from robotics to oil drilling  the decontamination project is an attempt to extend the lives of masks that already exist. Late last month  Battelle was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration to expand its decontamination efforts  following pressure from President Trump and Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio. Battelle said its process  what they call the Critical Care Decontamination System  will eventually be able to clean 80 000 masks a day per site  and that each mask can be cleaned up to 20 times before losing effectiveness. Hundreds of employees are involved  and thousands more are being hired  with many going through training to set up decontamination sites on Long Island and in Seattle  Boston  Washington  D.C.  and elsewhere. For now  the bulk of the operations are happening roughly 20 miles west of downtown Columbus. Like many efforts underway  Battelle’s project was barely an idea three weeks ago. The company had used vaporized hydrogen peroxide to sterilize sensitive equipment for years. But to develop a large-scale decontamination process  the logistics were hurriedly sketched out on a conference room table by a handful of experts and executives. Battelle’s West Jefferson site has since received scores of face coverings  double-bagged and stored in boxes marked with biohazard symbols. Health care networks like OhioHealth and Mercy Health are delivering their used masks by trained couriers. Recently  the chief of a local fire department dropped off masks in person. Up to 50 boxes  containing thousands of masks  show up every day. The number of boxes is expected “to grow exponentially” as hospitals work out safe collection procedures  said Kevin Sayers  who is helping to oversee the West Jefferson operation. In early April  Gov. DeWine said that Battelle would decontaminate masks for free for two weeks. Preparing newly arrived masks for decontamination requires small teams of workers in the tents  each wearing black rubber boots  two layers of gloves  surgical scrubs  a lab coat and a portable  powered air purifying respirator attached to a belt that blows filtered air into a closed hood over the worker’s head. Each mask is inspected before it is processed; roughly 10 percent are soiled or broken and cannot be decontaminated  according to Mr. Sayers. “We’re seeing a lot of masks right now that have makeup on them ” he said. When ready to be decontaminated  the masks are brought inside a 1 000-cubic-foot chamber. Inside the decontamination chamber  the teams position the masks  in batches of 5 000 per cycle  on wire shelves affixed to the chamber’s metal walls  taking care to avoid overlapping. The workers then exit the chamber  spraying themselves with a 70-percent alcohol solution. The precaution requires a gallon of alcohol each day. A contraption known as a vapor phase hydrogen peroxide generator  which looks like a washing machine with two hoses  is then used to circulate the colorless gas into and out of the room. During the first four hours  workers increase the humidity inside the chamber  causing the hydrogen peroxide to collect as condensation on the masks  neutralizing the coronavirus and other contaminants. Over the next four hours  the gas is flushed out of the room. The teams then re-enter the chamber to inspect the masks and conduct spot tests for harmful levels of residual hydrogen peroxide. They then confirm that chemical indicator cards placed throughout the chamber have changed color — the sign of a successful decontamination. Before being repackaged and sent back to hospitals  the masks are individually marked with the number of decontamination cycles they have passed through. Last week  for the first time since the effort began  a mask was submitted for a repeat cleaning. “It was nice to see a mask come back ” Mr. Sayers said. “It means that it has been used multiple times and will continue to be used  instead of being thrown out.” As more sites start decontaminating masks and more hospitals participate  Mr. Sayers expects Battelle to start accepting deliveries all day and through the night. The organization hopes to win approval to expand its procedure to other types of personal protective equipment  such as face shields and surgical masks. One aspect of the effort  however  worries Mr. Sayers: the number of people needed to run decontamination shifts as the pandemic continues to overwhelm the medical community. “It requires a team of dedicated people working a lot of hours ” he said. “We’re going to need more and more manpower as the need continues to grow.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/trump-fauci-coronavirus.html, us politics, Trump Lashes Out at Fauci Amid Criticism of Slow Virus Response, The president retweeted a post calling for the government’s top infectious disease specialist to be fired after the doctor acknowledged that shutting down the country earlier could have saved lives., Supported by The president retweeted a post calling for the government’s top infectious disease specialist to be fired after the doctor acknowledged that shutting down the country earlier could have saved lives. By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Trump publicly signaled his frustration on Sunday with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the federal government’s top infectious disease expert  after the doctor said more lives could have been saved from the coronavirus if the country had been shut down earlier. Mr. Trump reposted a Twitter message that said “Time to #FireFauci” as he rejected criticism of his slow initial response to the pandemic that has now killed more than 22 000 people in the United States. The president privately has been irritated at times with Dr. Fauci  but the Twitter post was the most explicit he has been in letting that show publicly. The message Mr. Trump retweeted came from a former Republican congressional candidate. “Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could’ve saved more lives ” said the tweet by DeAnna Lorraine  who got less than 2 percent of the vote in an open primary against Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month. “Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US at large. Time to #Fire Fauci.” In reposting the message  Mr. Trump added: “Sorry Fake News  it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up.” The tweet came amid a flurry of messages blasted out by the president on Sunday defending his handling of the coronavirus  which has come under sharp criticism  and pointing the finger instead at China  the World Health Organization  President Barack Obama  the nation’s governors  Congress  Democrats generally and the news media. Mr. Trump did not “ban China ” but he did block foreign nationals who had been in China in the past 14 days from coming into the United States starting on Feb. 2. Despite the policy  40 000 Americans and other authorized travelers have still come into the country from China since then. Dr. Fauci and other public health experts were initially skeptical that the China travel restrictions would be useful when the president was first considering them  but then changed their minds and told Alex M. Azar II  the secretary of health and human services  on the morning of Jan. 30 that they supported them. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed back to those travel limits to defend his handling of the pandemic  but experts have said the limits were useful mainly to buy time that the administration did not then use to ramp up widespread testing and impose social distancing policies before infections could begin growing exponentially. By the third week of February  advisers had drafted a list of measures they believed would soon be necessary  like school closures  sports and concert cancellations and stay-at-home orders  but the president did not embrace them until mid-March. Dr. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984  said on Sunday that earlier imposition of such policies would have made a difference. “I mean  obviously  you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier  you could have saved lives ” he said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “Obviously  no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated. But you’re right. Obviously  if we had  right from the very beginning  shut everything down  it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down.” Dr. Fauci’s comments  and the president’s pushback  come at a critical time as Mr. Trump wrestles with how fast to begin reopening the country. Public health experts like Dr. Fauci have urged caution about resuming normal life too soon for fear of instigating another wave of illness and death  while the president’s economic advisers and others are anxious to restart businesses at a time when more than 16 million Americans have been put out of work. Dr. Fauci and the president have publicly disagreed on several issues  including how long it will take to develop a vaccine and the president’s aggressive promotion of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine  whose effects are unproven against the coronavirus. At a coronavirus task force briefing last week  Mr. Trump stopped Dr. Fauci from answering a question on the drug. Dr. Fauci has become a celebrated figure among much of the public  which trusts him far more than Mr. Trump  according to polls. A Quinnipiac University survey last week found that 78 percent of Americans approved of Dr. Fauci’s handling of the crisis compared with 46 percent who approved of the president’s response. That has prompted resentment among other government officials  some of whom have privately criticized Dr. Fauci for playing to the media and not always sending consistent messages. Mr. Trump spent much of Easter Sunday deflecting criticism and finding other targets. “If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing  with all their might  the fact that President Trump ‘ignored early warnings about the threat ’ then why did Media & Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China?” he wrote. “They said ‘early & not necessary.’ Corrupt Media!” He cited a businessman in saying that “Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China.” He blamed states for not being ready. “Governors  get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected ” he wrote. “Be ready  big things are happening. No excuses!” He retweeted a message saying that the World Health Organization “enabled China’s obfuscation on coronavirus  and that it could have been containable had Beijing not lied to the world.” He also retweeted a post from a friendly conservative television outlet saying that the “Obama admin. repeatedly cut PPE stockpile ” referring to personal protective equipment  and “failed to replenish” it. The president seemed particularly upset about a New York Times article documenting the administration’s slow response to the virus. “The @nytimes story is a Fake  just like the ‘paper’ itself ” he wrote Sunday night  denying that Mr. Azar warned him “until later” and dismissing an early memo by another adviser  Peter Navarro  who warned of the prospect of 500 000 deaths. “Fake News!” He did not explain why  if he thought the stockpile was inadequate  he did nothing in his three years in office to replenish it. And in none of his messages did he say why he waited to recommend social distancing measures that experts have credited with helping to stem the spread of the virus.

If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.

If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/us/politics/12dc-virus-trump2/12dc-virus-trump2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v2.png 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings.html, us politics, They Watch Trump’s Virus Briefings Daily. Here’s What They Have to Say., The president has millions of viewers for his daily appearances  but even in a pandemic that has paralyzed the nation  a stark partisan divide runs through how they see him., Supported by The president has millions of viewers for his daily appearances  but even in a pandemic that has paralyzed the nation  a stark partisan divide runs through how they see him. By Annie Karni  Nate Schweber and Christina Capecchi WASHINGTON — For some supporters  President Trump’s daily appearances with his coronavirus task force are a reassuring ritual during a time of crisis  consumed from the folds of a leather sectional  snacks and beverages within easy reach. “If anybody is going to give us the most answers  it’s the White House ” said August Gernentz  19  a construction worker from Red Wing  Minn.  as he settled into his bedroom Thursday night with potato chips and a Dr Pepper to stream the briefing on his big-screen television. For the president’s opponents  the news conference has become a daily hate-watch  a blaring infomercial in which Mr. Trump claims credit  demands gratitude  spreads false information and attacks the press. “He’s not qualified to answer that! What does he know?” Irma Sindicic  50  a second-grade teacher who lives on Staten Island  yelled at her computer screen the same night as she listened to Mr. Trump deliver a vague answer about the availability of tests while she cooked pork chops. “Where’s Fauci? I want Fauci ” she said  referring to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  one of the leading health experts on the president’s coronavirus task force. The briefings make her blood boil  but Ms. Sindicic said she continues to tune in  night after night. “You need a debrief from the briefing because you have to weigh what is fact and what is fiction ” she said. “But I find if I want to be informed in the world  I have to have it on. It’s hard.” Then there are less partisan daily viewers like Tim Bray  49  a schoolteacher from Austin  Texas  who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but is willing to give credit to the president when he thinks it is deserved. “It was a good performance ” he said of Mr. Trump’s Thursday evening news conference  which the president uncharacteristically kept to just 20 minutes. Those opinions were among the reactions from almost two dozen regular viewers of Mr. Trump’s appearances interviewed before  during and after Thursday’s briefing and in follow-ups after Friday’s. The group included men and women of different ethnicities  ages 19 to 88. They were from the South  the Midwest and the East and West Coasts  and their opinions of Mr. Trump varied from strong support to deep disdain. Democrats and Republicans alike in the group described watching Mr. Trump as something close to a civic duty  even while they agreed that he was probably appearing at the briefings to help him in a re-election year. For Americans such as these  many stuck in their homes and trying to make sense of simultaneous health and economic crises they could not have imagined only a few months ago  Mr. Trump’s nightly news conferences have helped give structure to what they described as a series of Groundhog Days spent in anxious quarantine. They are part of an audience of millions who have watched on broadcast networks  cable news outlets and online since Mr. Trump first made a surprise appearance at a briefing hosted by Vice President Mike Pence on March 14  and decided he liked it. Mr. Trump’s daily appearances since then  rife with inaccuracies and false claims and laden with grievance and boasts  bear little resemblance in style to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fireside chats  the radio addresses during which he tried to soothe an anxious nation through a depression and a world war. In interviews  Democrats and Republicans alike conceded that the president appeared to be in over his head in dealing with the coronavirus  and that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah L. Birx  the White House’s coronavirus coordinator  were the more reliable voices to listen to for accurate information. Supporters of the president viewed the crisis as so overwhelming that they were willing to forgive Mr. Trump if he was floundering  because who wouldn’t be  they said. His opponents by and large said they couldn’t think of a person less suited to the moment. But the rapt attention the briefings have attracted from both the president’s supporters and many of his detractors suggest an instinct common to the audiences of both Roosevelt  one of the country’s most celebrated wartime presidents  and the president who has tried to brand himself as one. “Americans have been in the habit for decades of listening to the president during a crisis  and whatever he says  the habit remains ” said Michael Beschloss  a historian. The briefings  which have evolved organically since Mr. Trump’s first session last month  have also become a singular phenomenon. Roosevelt held “background” conferences with reporters in the Oval Office  and President John F. Kennedy mastered the television format and socialized with journalists. But no president has spent as much sustained time on television or jousting with the press. Opponents of sitting presidents have traditionally attacked them for any attempt at a “Rose Garden strategy” exploiting the advantages of incumbency in running for re-election. Democrats say Mr. Trump is running his campaign from the White House briefing room and have urged television executives not to carry his appearances. The daily spectacle has made stars of public health officials like Dr. Fauci and an unlikely fashion icon of the scarf-wearing Dr. Birx  two officials whom Americans across the political spectrum have come to rely on for clear information about the spread of the virus. The briefings also pose one of the biggest tests for Mr. Trump: whether he can reshape the narrative of the pandemic to make it seem like his and his administration’s belated and indecisive response was somehow a success. Even one of his most prominent supporters questioned the president’s behavior and message at the briefings. “The briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus  how Americans should change their behavior and what the government is doing to combat it ” The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial on Thursday. “But sometime in the last three weeks ” it added  “Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.” The editorial writers’ solution: Make the briefings no more than 45 minutes and confine the president’s appearances to twice a week. Despite apparently following that advice as well as some of his advisers’ the day the editorial came out  Mr. Trump lashed out at The Journal and then reverted to form Friday evening  spending almost two and a half hours in the briefing room sparring with reporters. When asked about what metrics he was weighing as he decided when to reopen the economy  Mr. Trump pointed to his head. “That’s my metrics ” he said. He presented the decision of whether to reopen the country as a cliffhanger right out of “The Apprentice ” calling it “the biggest decision of my life.” Mr. Bray  the Austin teacher  had a less enthusiastic reaction to the performance than he had to the briefing the day before. “I worry that he’s going to privilege the economic argument over the health argument because the health argument is causing sacrifice leading to economic slowdown ” he said. “I think he views that as a losing position when it comes to politics.” But for the most part  Mr. Trump’s daily appearances have confirmed preconceived notions about him  for those interviewed by The New York Times and by national pollsters. Many of his supporters see an entertaining businessman concerned with getting the economy back on track  and they are almost always willing to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt. False statements  like Mr. Trump’s claim that people were being tested for the virus when they got off airplanes and trains  they blame on the president’s advisers. “Information is probably coming very fast ” said Eddie Bernal of Austin  who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but is undecided about 2020 and whose two restaurants and catering business have been closed  save for takeout  for nearly four weeks. “He’s relying on what people are telling him  on what’s being given to him by his administration.” If he did not appear to act in response to intelligence reports warning about the coronavirus in January  he has made up for it since. “I think he’s getting a lot more results that we don’t know yet that are probably very positive ” said Joe Aliotta  54  a Staten Island businessman. The president’s detractors see a man preoccupied with his re-election campaign who has dangerously played down the virus  risking lives  and consistently makes false and contradictory statements — just as he has throughout his presidency. “Just tell us what’s happening. I just want him to tell us the facts ” said Jacob Cavner  26  a derivatives trader in Chicago  who along with his fiancée turned the daily news conference into a drinking game last week  taking three gulps of his beer every time Mr. Trump lashed out at a reporter. “I feel sorry for him because he has a position that he can’t handle or that he doesn’t know how to handle ” said Grace Sweet  88  a retired guidance counselor from Jackson  Miss. “I don’t believe anything he says. I really don’t.” The partisan split on trusting the information Mr. Trump delivers has been striking. A new poll by Politico and Morning Consult found that 79 percent of Republicans were satisfied with the quality of the information about the pandemic that they were getting from Mr. Trump  while only 16 percent of Democrats said they were. And even among Republicans  there has been a notable split between those who watched Fox News regularly  and those who did not. Fox News viewers were 15 points more likely to say Mr. Trump “got it about right” when the coronavirus began to spread than those who did not watch  according to a poll by Navigator Research  which is overseen by leaders of several progressive organizations. While some recent polls have suggested that confidence in Mr. Trump’s handling of the outbreak was slipping  a recent Quinnipiac University poll his approval rating sits at about 45 percent  his highest rating in that poll since taking office. One of those who supports the president is Henry Louden  53  a developer in Miami Beach interviewed Thursday night. Mr. Trump  he said  was doing “the best he can” given that he was confronting a “new crisis.” Mr. Louden  whose 19-year-old son tested positive for the virus after going on a spring break trip to Cabo San Lucas  Mexico  despite warnings about the pandemic  admitted that he found it unhelpful when Mr. Trump said he would not wear a mask  despite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising people to do so. “He could have said he will consider it ” Mr. Louden said. But what he viewed as a misstep barely figured in his overall assessment of Mr. Trump’s performance. “I feel he’s putting all of his energy into this crisis to brief the American people every day and to provide us guidance  hope and economic support ” he said. “The president should not have to deal with obnoxious questions.” Sarah Dwyer  47  a Democrat who lives in Montclair  N.J.  was left with the opposite impression after watching the same briefing. “If Trump never made an appearance or spoke a word  he’d really have this country tricked into thinking he has this under control ” she said. “He does have a good supporting cast.” Annie Karni reported from Washington  Nate Schweber from New York and Christina Capecchi from Minneapolis.

Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/europe/netherlands-tulips-coronavirus.html, world europe, Where Have 140 Million Dutch Tulips Gone? Crushed by the Coronavirus, Demand for tulips dropped precipitously as flower shops around the globe have shut  consumers have gone into lockdown and celebrations have been canceled., Supported by Demand for tulips dropped precipitously as flower shops around the globe have shut  consumers have gone into lockdown and celebrations have been canceled. By Nina Siegal AMSTERDAM — For tulip growers in the Netherlands  Friday the 13th of March this year was a true horror show. When tulip stems came up at the country’s largest flower market in Aalsmeer  the prices stalled over and over again at zero. Frank Uittenbogaard  a director of JUB Holland  a 110-year-old family farm in Noordwijkerhout  made the tough decision to destroy his tulip stems — 200 000 of them. “That hurt a lot ” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “It’s very painful because you start in July with digging the bulbs and you have to give them the right treatment to plant them in October  and later move them to the greenhouse. We had very good quality tulips this year. I took my bike and went cycling when they did it because I couldn’t handle it.” North Sea NETHERLANDS Amsterdam Aalsmeer BELGIUM GERMANY 40 MILES By The New York Times He wasn’t the only grower who had to dump tulips: About 400 million flowers  including 140 million tulip stems  were destroyed over the past month  estimates Fred van Tol  manager of international sales for Royal FloraHolland  the largest cooperation of flower and plant producers in the Netherlands. Demand for tulips dropped precipitously as flower shops around the globe have shut down because of the outbreak  consumers have gone into lockdown and celebrations have been canceled. “This virus hit us right in the middle of the tulip sales ” Mr. van Tol said. “In total  four weeks out  the turnover is still 50 percent lower than last year.” Usually  the period from March through May — including the weeks in which International Women’s Day  Easter and Mother’s Day fall — is the Dutch flower industry’s strongest season. It pulls in 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion)  with an average of $30 million in flowers sold daily. Tulip growers put their wares up for sale starting in March  when the flowers begin to bloom. Tulip season usually lasts about eight weeks. Some parts of the industry have been hit harder than others because of the coronavirus outbreak  said Mr. van Tol  depending on the market that producers or distributors serve  with losses from about 10 percent up to about 85 percent. The Netherlands  which has recorded more than 24 400 coronavirus cases and 2 643 deaths  has put in place a moderate social policy to combat the spread of the virus without going into a full lockdown. Schools  restaurants  bars  museums  sports facilities and gyms are closed until April 28. Most events of more than 30 people have been banned until June 1. Small shops  however  such as florists and garden shops  can remain open as long as customers maintain a social distance of 1.5 meters (just under 5 feet) from each other and shop employees. While growers and distributors that primarily serve the local market are still able to sell flowers and plants domestically  those flower businesses that rely on international trade are worse off. Jan de Boer  the general director and owner of Barendsen  a global flower export company based in the Dutch village of Aalsmeer  said that he had lost 90 percent of his seasonal revenues so far. He typically has 60 full-time employees this time of year  and now  he says  he has work for only six. The Dutch government is paying those salaries  he said  so that hasn’t hurt his business for the moment. “What is my biggest problem?” he said. “My client Viking River Cruises is not going to have one American customer on a boat this year. I will lose all of the business with them  so for me that’s half a million or a million euros.” He has also lost all business to countries where florists are closed  including Italy  Spain and France. At the same time  millions of visitors who trek annually to the blooming tulip fields in the flower-growing region of Lisse have canceled trips  and the effects have rippled out to related businesses. The Keukenhof  the largest flower park in the Netherlands  typically welcomes 1.5 million visitors a year during its eight-week opening that coincides with the blooming of the tulips. But this year  because of the government’s anti-coronavirus measures  the park has been shut down from its scheduled opening day  March 21  until its scheduled closing date  May 10. That will cost it an estimated $25 million in revenues. “Nature doesn’t listen to all the regulations ” said Bart Siemerink  managing director of the Keukenhof. “We have a splendid spring in the Netherlands  and now the park is really looking beautiful. We’re doing our best to bring that to people stuck at home.” People can still view the untrammeled gardens online  via Keukenhof Virtually Open  until the flowers bloom again next year. The 25 staff gardeners  meanwhile  continue to maintain the park. Mr. de Boer said he expected Dutch flowers to bounce back. “I’m optimistic because people will always need flowers  to connect  to be together  to tell a story ” he said. “I’m optimistic about the flowers  but I’m not optimistic about how to finance the gap. If you can’t make up for the losses  you’re out of the game. So I will do my utmost to survive. “It’s more than money ” he added. “It’s a passion.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

By Ruth Maclean Photographs by Finbarr O’Reilly GAO  Mali — Six rifles  in my line of sight. Eleven bodies  only one (mine) female. Eleven flak jackets and helmets  slowly absorbing sweat. Eleven camp beds  mosquito nets and backpacks  hooked behind dark green seats alongside some wooden crates of ammunition. Thousands of baby wipes  as our next shower would be many days away. This was a squad in a fearsome desert battle group trundling through the Malian steppe — soldiers of the legendary French Foreign Legion  which welcomes recruits from anywhere in the world. They were a small part of Operation Barkhane — France’s mission to fight a terrorist insurgency in the vast stretch of land south of the Sahara known as the Sahel — in the belly of a tank-like infantry fighting vehicle. SAHEL LIBYA ALGERIA Africa MALI MAURITANIA NIGER Gao SENEGAL Niamey Bamako BURKINA FASO GUINEA NIGERIA IVORY COAST Gulf of Guinea 100 miles By The New York Times A photographer and I were along for the ride with the soldiers  our legs entangled in polite negotiations with each other. Rudimentary hygiene. Casual human proximity. This was the pre-coronavirus era. After a long reporting trip  during which a few coronavirus cases began to be reported in countries across Africa  I arrived home and opened my notebooks to find a time capsule  portraits of a bygone time full of body contact and shared surfaces. A cheerful  strapping young Brazilian stroking his Nepali comrade’s cheek  teasing him in accented French for not shaving properly. The Nepali holding the Brazilian’s gun while he fished behind his seat for some chocolate. A precious cup of coffee shared between four men. It was the squad’s first time in the field together  and these elite soldiers of all nations were building camaraderie. “Come here  baby ” the Brazilian said to his assault rifle  hoisting it up through the hatch in the roof and aiming it at the horizon for what he and everyone called Les G.A.T.s — the French acronym for Armed Terrorist Group. A Hungarian sergeant held the Brazilian’s leg steady as he got his balance. Standing in the hatch was the one opportunity in our four-day journey for a little privacy  or what we might now call social distancing. My turn to stick my torso up — while my legs stayed down below — coincided with that of the Nepali soldier  almost totally concealed in desert battle uniform  looking for G.A.T.s through his gun sights. This soldier  who under the rules of the trip can be identified only as Private Binod  turned out to be a Hindu-Buddhist. He preferred Buddhism  but ate a lot of meat  so didn’t think of himself as a very good follower of Buddha. Buddha said “not to kill  not to make war ” the soldier said  looking out at the savanna. This was his second week of his first trip to Africa. If he spotted someone with a weapon  he was under instructions to tell his sergeant  and the information was passed up the chain of command until someone  with help from two scouts from the Malian army  decided whether it was friend or enemy. If enemy  Pvt. Binod could get the order to kill. In the vehicle  down below  soldiers lent out precious sunglasses  shook electrolytes into each others’ water bottles  helped buckle helmets. Hailing from six countries  they had few shared cultural reference points — few TV shows they could reminisce about together  no dishes from back home they all missed. Their common ground was the Legion  and long journeys in fortresses on giant wheels  flipping over thorn trees as if they were dandelions. The 17 cubic yards of air-conditioned  pistachio-green space was a cramped haven from the vast world outside. A month after the trip  when the world had changed  I wondered: How are they doing this now? The carrier’s interior must no longer be a refuge  but a weapon itself  each surface touched many times by many hands. Ration packs rooted through over and over to find the good snacks. An intimate knowledge of the dozen or so ration packs was important. Otherwise  like me  you’d get stuck eating pork with rice and pineapple three days in a row. Not recommended. There were some decent crackers in some of the ration packs  but interspersed with other  identical-looking atrocious ones. I have no idea how they managed to make them taste so bad. But as we glided over trees  anthills and dry river beds  I began to become a pro  combining a ration pack with good crackers with another that had good canned cheese. The soldiers dozed off  their lullaby the sounds of the vehicle’s movement  a symphony of happy squeaks like a child having a go on a violin. I’ve heard legionnaires described as mercenaries  and at one time  the Legion was known as a place where anyone in trouble could have a fresh start  a new name and  after three years of service  French citizenship. But before I’d even asked  the press officer — who kept a close eye on me throughout this journey — assured me that background checks are stringent and that the force no longer takes rapists  murderers or serious drug dealers. Recently  Mali’s ambassador to Paris implied that the legionnaires were troublemakers — “tattooed all over” — wreaking havoc in the streets of Bamako  Mali’s capital. It was a curious observation given  as the French defense minister pointed out  that there are almost no legionnaires stationed in Bamako. But tattoos are traditional  as is cursing — in French  Moldovan or Ukrainian  as the case may be. The legionnaires took much better care of me than of themselves. Almost every night  they made up my own cot for me. Perhaps now I would insist on doing it myself  worrying about being infected. At the time  I felt nothing but gratitude. They also reminded me to eat  made me tea on a tiny disposable stove  helped me find an unoccupied bathroom bush at night  and shared a precious  technically forbidden bottle of wine. I lent the young Brazilian my camping fork to tuck into one of the three 3 700-calorie ration packs I watched him eat in a day. When he was done  he took out one of his rationed tissues and wiped it with great care before giving it back. Now  seeing everything through a viral lens  it’s a poignant memory. After four days  a helicopter with a Danish crew roared in to drop supplies. I caught a ride out. As we zoomed away  the carrier faded into the vast Sahel  the color of weak tea  empty but not empty. The desert is full of things you don’t see when you’re down below in a windowless vehicle  or concentrating on spotting G.A.T.s. Houses made of stick frames with mats draped over them for walls. Little boys fetching water. Tracks  everywhere. Tiny hills  sprinkled with volcanic pebbles like confectioner’s sugar through a sieve. Goats and camels and long-horned cattle. After four days of sun-warmed water  I’d be lying if I said the cold Coke a Dane handed me wasn’t the best thing I’ve ever drunk. A shower  an incredible luxury. But I half wanted to stay with the legionnaires  whose voyage through the savanna continued. I’d begun to be enveloped in their camaraderie  and to understand why it’s so important to them. I’d wonder about their well-being until  a few weeks later  some of them popped up on Instagram  sending me cheery messages. Then the French military announced that four soldiers with Operation Barkhane had tested positive. Are any of them soldiers I got to know? The statement gave no names. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces.

No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/world/00foreignlegion-dispatch1/00foreignlegion-dispatch1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

A Biden spokeswoman said the allegation is false  and former Senate office staff members do not recall such an incident., Supported by Ms. Reade  a former Senate aide  has accused Mr. Biden of assaulting her in 1993 and says she told others about it. A Biden spokeswoman said the allegation is false  and former Senate office staff members do not recall such an incident. By Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember WASHINGTON — A former Senate aide who last year accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of inappropriate touching has made an allegation of sexual assault against the former vice president  the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee this fall. The former aide  Tara Reade  who briefly worked as a staff assistant in Mr. Biden’s Senate office  told The New York Times that in 1993  Mr. Biden pinned her to a wall in a Senate building  reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers. A friend said that Ms. Reade told her the details of the allegation at the time. Another friend and a brother of Ms. Reade’s said she told them over the years about a traumatic sexual incident involving Mr. Biden. A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden said the allegation was false. In interviews  several people who worked in the Senate office with Ms. Reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar behavior by Mr. Biden toward her or any women. Two office interns who worked directly with Ms. Reade said they were unaware of the allegation or any treatment that troubled her. Last year  Ms. Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Mr. Biden of kissing  hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Ms. Reade told The Times then that Mr. Biden had publicly stroked her neck  wrapped his fingers in her hair and touched her in ways that made her uncomfortable. Soon after Ms. Reade made the new allegation  in a podcast interview released on March 25  The Times began reporting on her account and seeking corroboration through interviews  documents and other sources. The Times interviewed Ms. Reade on multiple days over hours  as well as those she told about Mr. Biden’s behavior and other friends. The Times has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to Ms. Reade about her allegation; nearly two dozen people who worked with Mr. Biden during the early 1990s  including many who worked with Ms. Reade; and the other seven women who criticized Mr. Biden last year  to discuss their experiences with him. No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting  nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden. On Thursday  Ms. Reade filed a report with the Washington  D.C.  police  saying she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993; the public incident report  provided to The Times by Ms. Reade and the police  does not mention Mr. Biden by name  but she said the complaint was about him. Ms. Reade said she filed the report to give herself an additional degree of safety from potential threats. Filing a false police report may be punishable by a fine and imprisonment. Ms. Reade  who worked as a staff assistant helping manage the office interns  said she also filed a complaint with the Senate in 1993 about Mr. Biden; she said she did not have a copy of it  and such paperwork has not been located. The Biden campaign said it did not have a complaint. The Times reviewed an official copy of her employment history from the Senate that she provided showing she was hired in December 1992 and paid by Mr. Biden’s office until August 1993. The seven other women who had complained about Mr. Biden told the Times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add  but several said they believed Ms. Reade’s account. Last year  Mr. Biden  77  acknowledged the women’s complaints about his conduct  saying his intentions were benign and promising to be “more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space.” In response to Ms. Reade’s allegation  Kate Bedingfield  a deputy Biden campaign manager  said in a statement: “Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women. He authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard — and heard respectfully. Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: It is untrue. This absolutely did not happen.” Ms. Reade made her new allegation public as Mr. Biden was closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination after winning a string of primaries against his chief rival  Senator Bernie Sanders. Ms. Reade  who describes herself as a “third-generation Democrat ” said she originally favored Marianne Williamson and Senator Elizabeth Warren in the race but voted for Mr. Sanders in the California primary last month. She said her decision to come forward had nothing to do with politics or helping Mr. Sanders  and said neither his campaign nor the Trump campaign had encouraged her to make her allegation. President Trump has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women  who have described a pattern of behavior that went far beyond the accusations against Mr. Biden. The president also directed illegal payments  including $130 000 to a pornographic film actress  Stormy Daniels  before the 2016 election to silence women about alleged affairs with Mr. Trump  according to federal prosecutors. Mr. Trump has even boasted about his mistreatment of women; in a 2005 recording  he described pushing himself on women and said he would “grab them by the pussy ” bragging that he could get away with “anything” because of his celebrity. Even so  Mr. Trump has at times attacked opponents over their treatment of women. The president has not mentioned Ms. Reade’s allegation  which has circulated on social media and in liberal and conservative news outlets. Ms. Reade  56  told The Times that the assault happened in the spring of 1993. She said she had tracked down Mr. Biden to deliver an athletic bag when he pushed her against a cold wall  started kissing her neck and hair and propositioned her. He slid his hand up her cream-colored blouse  she said  and used his knee to part her bare legs before reaching under her skirt. “It happened at once. He’s talking to me and his hands are everywhere and everything is happening very quickly ” she recalled. “He was kissing me and he said  very low  ‘Do you want to go somewhere else?’” Ms. Reade said she pulled away and Mr. Biden stopped. “He looked at me kind of almost puzzled or shocked ” she said. “He said  ‘Come on  man  I heard you liked me.’” At the time  Ms. Reade said she worried whether she had done something wrong to encourage his advances. “He pointed his finger at me and he just goes: ‘You’re nothing to me. Nothing ’” she said. “Then  he took my shoulders and said  ‘You’re OK  you’re fine.’” Mr. Biden walked down the hallway  Ms. Reade said  and she cleaned up in a restroom  made her way home and  sobbing  called her mother  who encouraged her to immediately file a police report. Instead  Ms. Reade said  she complained to Marianne Baker  Mr. Biden’s executive assistant  as well as to two top aides  Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman  about harassment by Mr. Biden — not mentioning the alleged assault. The staff declined to take action  Ms. Reade said  after which she filed a written complaint with a Senate personnel office. She said office staff took away most of her duties  including supervising the interns; assigned her a windowless office; and made the work environment uncomfortable for her. She said Mr. Kaufman later told her she was not a good fit in the office  giving her a month to look for a job. Ms. Reade never secured another position in Washington. In an interview  Mr. Kaufman  a longtime friend of Mr. Biden’s who was his chief of staff at the time  said: “I did not know her. She did not come to me. If she had  I would have remembered her.” Mr. Toner  who worked for Mr. Biden for over three decades  said the allegation was out of character for Mr. Biden. Other senators and office staffs had reputations for harassing women at work and partying after hours  according to those who worked in the office at the time. Mr. Biden was known for racing to catch the train to get home to Wilmington  Del.  every night. “It’s just so preposterous that Senator Biden would be faced with these allegations ” said Mr. Toner  who was deputy chief of staff when Ms. Reade worked in the office. “I don’t remember her. I don’t remember this conversation. And I would remember this conversation.” The Biden campaign issued a statement from Ms. Baker  Mr. Biden’s executive assistant from 1982 to 2000. “I never once witnessed  or heard of  or received  any reports of inappropriate conduct  period — not from Ms. Reade  not from anyone ” she said. “I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade’s accounting of events  which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional  and as a manager.” Melissa Lefko  a former staff assistant for Mr. Biden from 1992 to 1993  said she did not remember Ms. Reade. But she recalled that Mr. Biden’s office was a “very supportive environment for women” and said she had never experienced any kind of harassment there. “When you work on the Hill  everyone knows who the good guys are and who the bad guys are  and Biden was a good guy ” she said. Ms. Reade said that she could not remember the exact time  date or location of the assault but that it occurred in a “semiprivate” place in the Senate office complex. A friend said that Ms. Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time  in 1993. A second friend recalled Ms. Reade telling her in 2008 that Mr. Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she’d had a traumatic experience while working in his office. Both friends agreed to speak to The Times on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of their families and their self-owned businesses. Ms. Reade said she also told her brother  who has confirmed parts of her account publicly but who did not speak to The Times  and her mother  who has since died. At the time of the alleged assault  Ms. Reade said she was responsible for coordinating the interns in the office. Two former interns who worked with her said they never heard her describe any inappropriate conduct by Mr. Biden or saw her directly interact with him in any capacity but recalled that she abruptly stopped supervising them in April  before the end of their internship. Others who worked in the office at the time said they remembered Ms. Reade but not any inappropriate behavior. Friends and former co-workers describe Ms. Reade as friendly  caring  compassionate and trustworthy  though perhaps a bit naïve. A single mother  she changed her name for protection after leaving an abusive marriage in the late 1990s and put herself through law school in Seattle. After leaving Mr. Biden’s office  she eventually returned to the West Coast  where she worked for a state senator; as an advocate for domestic violence survivors  testifying as an expert witness in court; and for animal rescue organizations. During her time in Mr. Biden’s office  he was working to pass the Violence Against Women Act  which Mr. Biden has described as his “proudest legislative accomplishment.” In 2017  Ms. Reade retweeted praise for Mr. Biden and his work combating sexual assault. In more recent months  her feed has featured support for Mr. Sanders and criticism of Mr. Biden. Ms. Reade said she did not disclose the sexual assault allegation last year when she spoke out because she was scared. After her initial complaints were reported last year by a local California newspaper  Ms. Reade said she faced a wave of criticism and death threats  as well as accusations that she was a Russian agent because of Medium posts and tweets  several of which are now deleted  she had written praising President Vladimir Putin. Ms. Reade said that she was not working for Russia and did not support Mr. Putin  and that her comments were pulled out of context from a novel she was writing at the time. “It was trying to smear me and distract from what happened  but it won’t change the facts of what happened in 1993 ” she said. She called her praise for Mr. Putin “misguided.” Ms. Reade tried to get legal and public relations support from the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund  an initiative established by prominent women in Hollywood to fight sexual harassment. Her outreach to the group was first reported by The Intercept. As it has for thousands of people who have contacted the group  the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund  which does not represent clients  gave her a list of lawyers with expertise in such cases. She said she contacted every single one but none took her case. Two lawyers confirmed speaking to Ms. Reade but declined to comment on the record about her or the allegation. SKDKnickerbocker  the political consulting firm where Mr. Biden’s chief strategist  Anita Dunn  works as a managing director  has a contract with the Time’s Up legal defense fund. Ms. Dunn has never worked with the fund and her firm was not told of Ms. Reade’s request  according to officials at the fund. Ms. Reade also contacted at least one of the women who spoke out along with her last year about Mr. Biden’s penchant for physical contact. Lucy Flores  a former Nevada state assemblywoman who accused Mr. Biden of making her uncomfortable by kissing and touching her during a 2014 campaign event  exchanged a few emails last year with Ms. Reade but said Ms. Reade did not share her full story. “Biden is not just a hugger ” Ms. Flores said. “Biden very clearly was invading women’s spaces without their consent in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. Does he potentially have the capacity to go beyond that? That’s the answer everyone is trying to get at.” Kate Conger and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/coronavirus-easter-sunday.html, us, On Easter Sunday  Christians Remember: ‘We Will Rise Out of the Dust’, Amid a pandemic  millions of Americans refashioned rituals and grasped for hope in the story of Jesus’ resurrection., Supported by Amid a pandemic  millions of Americans refashioned rituals and grasped for hope in the story of Jesus’ resurrection. By Elizabeth Dias Not long after the sun rose on Easter morning  Beba Tata arrived at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minn.  ready to pray. It all felt strangely quiet  almost hollow  thought Ms. Tata  a Catholic chaplain. This was not the way she normally would celebrate the sacred day. But little has felt normal lately: Just a few days ago  she had been called to pray outside the sealed door of a coronavirus patient’s hospital room  at the urgent plea of his grieving wife. All around her  she was seeing echoes of the story of Jesus’ final days. His suffering on the cross while his loved ones watched “at a distance ” as the Book of Mark said. His final gasp for air. His disciples waiting  hoping  wondering about life beyond death. On Sunday  she looked up at a hospital television. A priest was celebrating the Easter Mass. She began to worship  her pager at her side in case she was called to see a patient. “That is where I find my hope  knowing death did not have the last word ” she said  reflecting on the story of Easter. “There is a time when this will be over  and we will rise out of the dust.” This Easter Sunday  amid a pandemic still working its way across the country  millions of American Christians found themselves refashioning beloved rituals and grasping for hope in the story of Jesus’ resurrection. Church buildings — normally packed on the holiday — stood empty  as restrictions against mass gatherings kept families in their homes and unable to worship together on one of the most holy days of the Christian calendar. Parents dressed children in Easter clothes  but had them watch services from the couch. The vast majority of churches across denominations celebrated the holiday virtually  in online services. A small handful of pastors in states like Louisiana and Mississippi defied stay-at-home guidance and hosted in-person worship services  risking the health of their followers and their own arrests. Others tried something in between  an attempt to maintain some semblance of communal ritual. In Franklin  Ky.  Victory Hill Church hosted a service at a drive-in movie theater  where people worshiped in their cars. In an empty St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York  Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan prayed over the communion cup and wine  his voice echoing across empty pews to the locked front door  as parishioners watched online. In Dallas  from the pulpit of First Baptist  Robert Jeffress thanked President Trump for defending religious liberty  after the president said in a tweet he would tune in to the service. On the National Mall in Washington  a few people gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to sing hymns and watch the sun rise. On a very personal level  the story of Jesus felt unusually close for many believers this Holy Week  and not just on Easter Sunday. Christians on the front lines of the coronavirus fight described in interviews their feelings of being drawn into the memory of Jesus’ suffering  death and resurrection  as they stared into suffering in their own midst and reflected on what it meant to hope. The veil between the story of Jesus and the story of the nation  they said  has felt thin. “It is an enormous mystery  and I do not understand it ” Rev. Amy Greene  director for the Center of Spiritual Care at the Cleveland Clinic  said of the resurrection. “Our job is to stand there and bear witness to people’s suffering even when we can’t stop it ” she said. “One of my students said  it is like standing at the foot of the cross. To bear witness to someone’s suffering and not run away. To say  I cannot stop this for you  I’m so sorry that I can’t  but I’m not going to leave.” On Wednesday in Denver  Becki Rwubusisi  a nurse practitioner who worships at Church of the Advent  paused on a bridge outside of the hospital where she works. She looked out to the mountains  opened the Bible app on her phone  and took a moment to breathe. She recited a prayer with each breath in  and each breath out: Christ have mercy  Lord have mercy. When she got home that evening to her 6-year-old twins  she choked up. “I was reading to them how Jesus died  was in the tomb  came back to life ” she said. “Thinking about how patients are entering into that suffering …” her voice trailed off. “We don’t know if they are going to come out the other side.” “I keep clinging to this: Even death is not the end of the story ” she said. On Thursday  the day Christians remember the Last Supper  Dr. Raymond Barfield  a pediatric oncologist and palliative care physician  stood in an intensive care room in Durham  N.C.  where his teenage cancer patient needed a ventilator to breathe and her father hoped she would not die. Dr. Barfield  who is also a professor at Duke Divinity School  remembered how Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane on that same night years ago had asked God that “this cup would pass from me ” praying so fervently that his sweat became “like drops of blood ” as the Book of Luke said. The answer to that prayer was no  the cup would not pass  he remembered  and Jesus would walk on to his death. “We have these apparently comfortable beliefs about God  that as long as we pray the right prayers and do the right things  we are going to be able to trust that the power of God will keep us from terrible things happening ” he said. “God is saying  you are not alone ” he said. “You may think that death will leave you alone  but even in death  you are not alone  I am here.” On Good Friday  the day Christians remember Jesus being crucified  the Rev. Marilyn Barnes  vice president of spiritual care for Advocate Aurora Health in Chicago  and her team of chaplains offered packets of tea and chocolate to nurses and staff. She looked into their eyes  above their masks  to connect amid what she called “the darkness of grief.” “I think about the death  and right now  the separation  when people are unable to be physically with their loved one when they die ” she said. “I know that God is present and that the Spirit is present in those moments ” she said. “We are holding on to the love of God as that anchor  until that light can burst through.” On Saturday  the day Christians remember the fear of early believers that God had died  Father Matt O’Donnell  a Catholic priest on the South Side of Chicago  sat in his church  St. Columbanus  and made calls to church members  especially older people. “A lot of my parishioners and people in my community  they really feel alone  and they feel the weight of this suffering ” he said. “The church is still here  we still have ministry to do.” It is that reminder of presence amid pain that Ms. Tata  the chaplain at Mayo  was also thinking about on Saturday night. Like many Christians across the country  she watched an Easter Vigil service  observing a night of waiting  holding hope for Jesus’ resurrection the next day. In the online message  her priest pointed worshipers to Jesus’ disciples  who hid in a room after his death. Then  during their fear  Jesus appeared to them. Before she went to sleep  she took a moment to write down a reflection. “Hope does not mean the end of all suffering  it does not mean that when I wake up tomorrow the coronavirus will be gone ” she wrote. “But to me hope means confronting my suffering and fear in a new way.” And on Easter morning  in the hospital  she got ready to accompany patients in their suffering. She prepared to bring communion to one. She gathered medallions of angels for another. “There is a heaviness in the atmosphere ” she said. “My hope is that I bring this with me  the hope and joy of the risen Lord.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/us/12virus-easter-01/12virus-easter-01-articleLarge-v3.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-elizabeth-dias/author-elizabeth-dias-thumbLarge.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/technology/phone-calls-voice-virus.html, technology, The Humble Phone Call Has Made a Comeback, The volume of phone calls has surged more than internet use as people want to hear each other’s voices in the pandemic., Supported by The volume of phone calls has surged more than internet use as people want to hear each other’s voices in the pandemic. By Cecilia Kang Alyssa MacKenzie  32  rarely used her smartphone to make phone calls  apart from the occasional conversation for her work as a disability rights advocate. But when the lockdown for the coronavirus set in  Ms. MacKenzie could no longer pop by her mother’s house a few minutes away in New Canaan  Conn. So she has called her multiple times a day  including once recently to get a recipe for pasta e fagioli. A couple of hours later  she said  they were still talking. “We started with the recipe  then talked about my younger brother  then my work  then her day  and next thing I knew  the soup was done ” Ms. MacKenzie said. “I needed to hear the familiarity of her voice.” Phone calls have made a comeback in the pandemic. While the nation’s biggest telecommunications providers prepared for a huge shift toward more internet use from home  what they didn’t expect was an even greater surge in plain old voice calls  a medium that had been going out of fashion for years. Verizon said it was now handling an average of 800 million wireless calls a day during the week  more than double the number made on Mother’s Day  historically one of the busiest call days of the year. Verizon added that the length of voice calls was up 33 percent from an average day before the outbreak. AT&T said that the number of cellular calls had risen 35 percent and that Wi-Fi-based calls had nearly doubled from averages in normal times. In contrast  internet traffic is up around 20 percent to 25 percent from typical daily patterns  AT&T and Verizon said. The rise is stunning given how voice calls have long been on the decline. Some 90 million wired phone lines in the United States have ceased using landline phones since 2000  according to USTelecom. Wireless calls replaced much of that calling activity  but the volume of minutes spent on phone calls hasn’t changed much over the past decade as people turned to texting and to apps like FaceTime and WhatsApp  according to wireless carriers and analysts. New needs are emerging in the crisis. “We’ve become a nation that calls like never before ” said Jessica Rosenworcel  a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission  the agency that oversees phone  television and internet providers. “We are craving human voice.” Though phone calls are now made over airwaves that connect through cell towers  the appeal of talking hasn’t changed much from the earliest telephone days of the late 1800s and early 1900s  when wooden poles stretched copper wire lines across the nation and into every home in America. In Albany  La.  the priests and deacons of St. Margaret Queen of Scotland church recently divided up a list of 900 parishioners to call to check in on them  something they never did because they saw their members in person. Some of the congregants in the rural community outside New Orleans were suspicious when they answered  accustomed to robocalls from unfamiliar numbers. But Brad Doyle  the associate priest  said they eased up when he began to speak. They talked about their daily routines and said they missed Sunday service  especially ahead of Easter. One congregant went into great detail about the Netflix documentary “Tiger King.” Many wanted to just hear a prayer  he said. Grace McClellan  32  a high school teacher in Charleston  S.C.  has also turned to phone calls as an antidote to the loneliness of living apart from family and friends. She has begun synchronizing a daily walk-and-talk with her best friend  who lives in Connecticut. With her friend’s voice piping through her earbuds  “it feels as close as possible to a real walk together ” Ms. McClellan said. The return of the voice call is a throwback for telecom companies. For years  Verizon  CenturyLink and AT&T have retired copper wire phone lines that were introduced 150 years ago. The companies have instead invested in broadband networks and expanding capacity for things like higher-resolution video and video gaming. They also beefed up their networks to handle next-generation wireless technology  called 5G  which will allow people to download a movie in seconds and may spur a wave of driverless car technology and robotics. “For years  we’ve seen a steady decline in the amount of time people spend talking to one another  especially on wireless devices ” Kyle Malady  Verizon’s chief technology officer  said in a statement. “The move to staying at home has reignited people’s hunger to stay connected  voice to voice.” The surge in voice calls is for both business and personal purposes  said Chris Sambar  AT&T’s executive vice president of technology and operations. Before the spread of the coronavirus led to stay-at-home orders  wireless calls typically peaked in the morning and evening rush hours. Once people got to their offices and schools  the call volumes fell. Now  he said  voice calls are high throughout the day. While Zoom and Google Hangouts are a popular replacement for meetings with multiple colleagues  the phone is easier for one-on-one conversations and doesn’t buffer and break down like video. On weekends  phone traffic is also much higher than normal. “Voice is the new killer app ” Mr. Sambar said. “It’s been a real surprise.” He added that AT&T and other phone providers had experienced hiccups in their networks with increased voice call volumes  but had made upgrades to calling connection points and were able to handle the new demand. Even young adults who grew up with texting and messaging apps as a primary form of communication are embracing voice calls. Emily Lancia  20  a college student  said she now called her parents daily instead of weekly from the campus of the State University of New York at Binghamton. Walking on the campus nature preserve one day this week  she was inspired to ring her best friend from childhood  whom she texts with almost daily but has never called. “It was nice to hear her voice ” said Ms. Lancia  a junior. Heading into spring break  Ms. Lancia said she was comforted by the voices of family and friends. That was especially true  she said  of her dad’s deep guttural laugh and what has become his quotidian phone greeting: “What’s up  peanut? What have you done for the last 12 hours?” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/business/08virus-phones/08virus-phones-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/multimedia/author-cecilia-kang/author-cecilia-kang-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/multimedia/03-Parenting-screentime/03-Parenting-screentime-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/travel/13coronavirus-52-promo/13coronavirus-52-promo-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/realestate/13virus-quarantine/13virus-quarantine-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/arts/13livestreaming-art/13livestreaming-art-mediumThreeByTwo210-v3.jpg 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/sports/coronavirus-fitness-trainers-workouts.html, sports, Fitness Instructors Flock Online to Pump You Up, With widespread stay-at-home orders  they are using social media to stream their workouts. But many trainers are facing financial straits from a lack of paying clientele., Supported by With widespread stay-at-home orders  they are using social media to stream their workouts. But many trainers are facing financial straits from a lack of paying clientele. By Adam Skolnick It was a little after noon on March 26  and Naomi Campbell was working out in her living room in New York City. Disco music on blast  she crushed a set of squats  guided by her personal trainer  Joe Holder  who had tailored the 40-minute workout. As she started a grueling set of flutter kicks  Campbell stopped and glared at her trainer. “Oh my God ” she said. He couldn’t help but laugh. Holder was not in the room  however. He was monitoring her on camera as she cycled through the circuit. Thousands of other people on Instagram Live were watching too — and participating — in what is normally a private workout between the supermodel and her trainer. As America hunkers down during the coronavirus pandemic  free fitness workouts  many of them delightfully low-tech  are multiplying on social media platforms. They are being delivered by trainers and yogis and retired athletes. Holder calls these people the “player-coaches for the real world.” While he and Campbell were doing their workout  two big-bearded trainers in Los Angeles were leading their clients through a similar session  as was an Olympic hopeful in the triple jump. An Ironman triathlete in Malibu led a flow yoga class. Those are just a few of the sessions available on social media each week. Home workout posts on Instagram feeds and stories in the United States increased over fivefold on March 18 compared with a few days prior  a Facebook company spokeswoman said  which was around the time governors in some states began imploring people to stay home. (California was the first to order all residents to stay home  effective March 19.) Facebook Live has thousands of options  as well. Nike has made its premium content free through mid-June  and Chris Hemsworth  the actor  recently made his Centr app free for six weeks  and as a result  views of workouts  articles and recipes have nearly quadrupled. Even lesser-known trainers and studios are going live and finding an audience. Nic Knerr  36  and Scott Forrester  29  teach high-intensity interval training classes at Circuit Works in Santa Monica  Calif.  where they’ve cultivated a devoted client base thanks to their James Harden beards  goofy humor and upbeat attitudes. That same flavor is now available  live  six days a week  on their new joint Instagram feed (@homewerkbnc). They are averaging 10 to 15 students per class. Tilita Lutterloh (@iamtilita)  39  coaches a handful of students through group workouts from her living room in Leimert Park in Los Angeles. Lutterloh was hoping to qualify for the Olympics in the triple jump and makes her living as a fitness coach and nutritionist. With the Olympics postponed  she offers classes three times a week  attended by a half-dozen students. A triathlete  ultradistance runner and longtime yoga instructor  Ted McDonald (@teddymcdonald)  49  teaches dozens of yoga students on Instagram and Facebook Live. Video fitness instruction is nothing new  but often what makes this current content so appealing are the low production values and an intimate feeling of being in the instructor’s living room or backyard. The equipment can be just as DIY. On a recent morning  Knerr and Forrester had students doing triceps dips off the end of a chair. Lutterloh demonstrated toe taps on an ottoman  and Holder picked up a vase of flowers to demonstrate cross-body chops and presses to Campbell and her followers. Although much of the content is free  most fitness trainers  the heart and soul of a nearly $100 billion global fitness industry  are self-employed and could face hard times with an extended stay-at-home period. Gin Dietz  a personal trainer based in Silicon Valley  estimates that she has lost 80 percent of her income. Like Dietz  Pixie Acia (@purposefulpixie)  a SoulCycle instructor in Southern California  is used to relying on multiple streams of income  but the pandemic has cut them off. “In one second you go from crushing it ” Acia said  “to having all the rugs pulled from underneath you.” It’s too soon to assess the impact on the industry  but ClassPass  an app that allows users to book classes at over 30 000 gyms and studios in 30 countries  lost 96 percent of its revenue in two weeks. Among the two dozen fitness and yoga instructors and gym and studio owners interviewed for this article  only three were well positioned to deal with an extended loss of income. (ClassPass is offering video classes on its app  too  by the way.) “It’s definitely scary times ” Forrester said. He has a wedding to pay for this summer  if that’s not canceled  too. Knerr signed up for unemployment immediately after the stay-at-home order was issued in Los Angeles County  though it won’t be enough to cover his rent. By the time Forrester attempted to sign up  California’s online unemployment enrollment system had crashed from intense demand. He eventually enrolled  and although his landlord has signaled a willingness to delay rent payments  he has student loans and credit card debt. “If this lasts a month  I feel we will be fine ” he said. “But if it lasts longer than that  it’s like  how do we survive?” Yet despite  or perhaps because of  the challenges they face  fitness professionals are adapting. Many are using video social media for the first time to reach existing clients and a new audience  and some ask for donations at the beginning and end of the classes they offer. “Just because everything is canceled doesn’t mean your life is canceled ” Lutterloh said. “It’s not about looking for the out  it’s about looking for what works.” As Holder put it: “Moving the body and physical fitness get your blood flowing to help your lymph system  and that creates a beneficial response in your immune system. But you’re also disengaging from an anxious state  and that anxiety has a huge impact on mental health and your immune system.” While Campbell  a celebrity for decades  has 8.7 million Instagram followers  Holder has 107 000. After playing football at the University of Pennsylvania  he worked for a nutrition start-up and moonlighted at a boutique gym training clients. In 2015  he signed with Nike to become one of its master trainers who film workouts delivered to subscribers on the Nike Training Club app  but he never stopped training private clients. In 2017  Campbell became a regular. Given their travel schedules  the sessions are often held remotely. On March 17  Campbell went live on her Instagram feed while she and Holder were working out on FaceTime. Since then  Holder estimated  more than 100 000 people have tuned in to their workouts. “It’s cool to see ” he said  adding that he would keep providing the workouts online for free. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

13/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/sports/football/nfl-marijuana-policy.html, sports football, N.F.L. Bows to Marijuana’s New Status, The league’s new labor agreement eased rules about players’ use and caught up with many sports that had already liberalized their policies., Supported by The league’s new labor agreement eased rules about players’ use and caught up with many sports that had already liberalized their policies. By Ken Belson The 10-year labor agreement between the N.F.L. and players union that was ratified on March 15 is filled with dozens of incremental changes  most notably the one-percentage-point increase in the share of league revenue that the players will receive. One of the biggest overhauls in the agreement  though  was a change the league had long resisted: loosening the rules governing players’ use of marijuana. Under the new collective bargaining agreement  players who test positive for marijuana will no longer be suspended. Testing will be limited to the first two weeks of training camp instead of from April to August  and the threshold for the amount of 9-delta tetrahydrocannabinol — or THC  the psychoactive compound in marijuana — needed to trigger a positive test will be raised fourfold. In adopting the changes  the N.F.L.  a league not known for its liberal views  caught up to and in some ways leapfrogged Major League Baseball  the N.B.A. and other leagues that had already eased their rules as acceptance of marijuana became more common in many parts of the country. “There is a generalized sense that the fans don’t care about the issue  so it’s possible to appear progressive ” said Paul Haagen  co-director of the Center for Sports Law and Policy at Duke University. N.F.L.’s laxer standards are a big departure from the past. But while players will not be suspended for positive tests  they can be fined several weeks’ salary  depending on the number of positive tests. First-time positive tests will  as before  mean diversion into a league-mandated treatment program. Players who refuse to take part in testing or clinical care can be suspended for three games after a fourth violation  with escalating penalties for further violations. Current and former players have long pushed for looser restrictions on marijuana  which they claim is a less addictive pain reliever than prescription medication  and a growing number of N.F.L. owners saw the rules as a hindrance because resulting suspensions kept some of their best players off the field. Over the years  the N.F.L. had resisted loosening its marijuana rules to avoid conflicting with federal and state laws. But as more states have approved the use of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes  the league found itself enforcing a policy that  in some instances  was more punitive than local laws. In 11 states  including seven with N.F.L. franchises  the drug is legal for any use. Thirty-one states allow use for medical reasons. The Green Bay Packers and the Tennessee Titans play in states where marijuana remains entirely illegal. The N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association continue to study the purported healing and addictive qualities of marijuana. The players pushed for a relaxed marijuana policy in part because of mounting research that details the hazards of alternatives — including the addiction rates among prescription opioid users and the irreversible internal damage that can be caused by opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  such as Toradol  which has long been used to treat N.F.L. players. “The league’s considerations included a number of issues  including its status legally  but most important was always the advice and recommendations of the medical and clinical professionals ” Brian McCarthy  a league spokesman  said. That “remains the case.” It is unclear what percentage of N.F.L. players use marijuana. Over the years  current and former players have estimated that 50 percent to 90 percent of players use the drug. Former players like Ricky Williams and Rob Gronkowski have openly discussed the benefits of marijuana and cannabidiol  or CBD  a nonintoxicating compound found in the plant. But it wasn’t until 2016 that the first active player — Eugene Monroe  an offensive lineman with the Baltimore Ravens — urged the league to stop testing players for marijuana so that he and others could take it to treat chronic pain. Now out of the league  Monroe said that the N.F.L. and union had not gone far enough in the new agreement. “Why are they still testing at all?” he said. “I don’t understand. Just move on from this and do the right thing and let the players make the choice. There’s no secret that players smoke marijuana.” The new rules will not change the status of players who are currently suspended for violating the substance abuse policy that is being replaced. Players who were banished under the previous agreement  after multiples positive tests  must still petition Commissioner Roger Goodell to be reinstated. For example  Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory  who has been suspended four times for missed or failed tests  has asked to be reinstated after being suspended indefinitely in February 2019  according to ESPN. Some current players said that the looser testing standards were irrelevant  because they did not use the drug. “No lie i could care less about the marijuana policy ” Quandre Diggs  a defensive back with the Seattle Seahawks  wrote on Twitter about 10 days before the agreement was ratified. Some former players warn that the looser rules could lead to a spike in drug abuse. Randy Grimes  who played 10 seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and now works as a substance abuse counselor after a long battle with opioid addiction  said that the N.F.L. must do more to address the mental health problems that drugs both mask and amplify. “The marijuana now is incredibly engineered and potent  and it’s trouble waiting to happen ” he said. “I’m in the industry that sees the danger of mood-altering substances  and that’s what marijuana is.” The trend in professional sports  though  is to reduce penalties. In December  Major League Baseball removed marijuana from its list of banned substances and now treats it the same way as alcohol: Players are not randomly tested unless they are in a treatment program. The National Hockey League still tests for marijuana  but there is no punishment for a positive result. Players with “a dangerously high level” of THC in their system are referred to the player assistance program for evaluation. N.B.A. players must take four random tests for marijuana during the regular season. After a first positive test  a player must enter a drug program. A second positive test will result in a $25 000 fine  and a third will lead to a five-game suspension. While the N.F.L. Players Association hailed the looser standards as a victory  they were also a win for the owners. In the making of this new labor deal  the relaxation of the testing rules may have been one of the easiest points to negotiate. The owners prioritized economic issues  like the split in revenue and the addition of extra games  over rules governing the workplace. Players sought to gain ground on those issues  demanding things like less taxing training camps and limits on the number of full-contact practices. The owners saw loosening the testing standards as a concession that might persuade some players to vote for the agreement  which ultimately passed by just 60 votes. “The owners were able to get two things done at the same time by minimizing the penalties and appealing to another segment of the membership ” said Charles Grantham  the director of the Center for Sport Management at Seton Hall University who was a longtime executive at the National Basketball Players Association. “They found religion because it was cheap and easy. It wasn’t a big give.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/sports/13NFL-Weed-Illo-print/13NFL-Weed-Illo-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-ken-belson/author-ken-belson-thumbLarge.jpg 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/obituaries/stirling-moss-dead.html, obituaries, Stirling Moss  One of the Greatest Drivers of All Time  Dies at 90, Known for his brash  puckish persona  he won 212 of his 529 races  including 16 Grand Prix victories  but never won the Grand Prix Championship title., Supported by Known for his brash  puckish persona  he won 212 of his 529 races  including 16 Grand Prix victories  but never won the Grand Prix Championship title. By Douglas Martin In the 1950s  small boys wanted to be Stirling Moss  and so did men. Boys saw him as the swashbuckling racecar driver whom many considered the best in the world. Men saw this and more: Moss made more than $1 million a year  more than any other driver  and was invariably surrounded by the jet-set beauties who followed the international racing circuit. Moss died quietly on Sunday at his home in London as one of his sport’s great legends. He was 90 and had been ill for some time. “It was one lap too many ” his wife  Susie  told The Associated Press. “He just closed his eyes.” Moss was a modern-day St. George  upholding the honor of England by often driving English cars  even though German and Italian ones were superior. Polls showed he was as popular as the queen. Moss said courage and stupidity were pretty much synonymous  and may have proved it in a succession of spectacular accidents: seven times his wheels came off  eight times his brakes failed. He was a racer  he insisted  not a driver. “To race a car through a turn at maximum possible speed when there is a great lawn to all sides is difficult ” he said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1961  “but to race a car at maximum speed through a turn when there is a brick wall on one side and a precipice on the other — ah  that’s an achievement!” He raced for 14 years  won 212 of his 529 races in events that included Grand Prix  sports cars and long-distance rallying  in 107 different types of car. He set the world land speed record on the salt flats of Utah in 1957. He won more than 40 percent of the races he entered  including 16 Grand Prix. For four consecutive years  1955-58  he finished second in the world Grand Prix championship. And in each of the next three years  he placed third. “If Moss had put reason before passion ” said Enzo Ferrari  “he would have been world champion many times.” He was called the best driver never to win the ultimate crown. He came closest in 1958  but testified on behalf of another driver  Mike Hawthorn  who was accused of an infraction in the Portugal Grand Prix. Hawthorn  as a result  was not disqualified. When the season ended  Hawthorn had 42 points  which are given for factors like fastest lap as well as finishing position. Moss — though he had four Grand Prix wins to Hawthorn’s one — finished second with 41 points. Polls of other drivers invariably named Moss No. 1  but it was his brash  puckish persona that captivated the public. He only reluctantly wore the required helmet  always white  saying he preferred a cloth cap. In 1955  he won the Italian Mille Miglia  a 992-mile road race  in 10 hours  beating the field by 31 minutes. In 1958  he gambled to win the Argentine Grand Prix by not changing his tires the entire 80 laps  despite their having a design life of 40 laps. In 1961  driving a four-cylinder Lotus  he fought off three six-cylinder Ferraris to win the Monaco Grand Prix. In 1960  Moss won the United States Grand Prix five months after breaking both legs and his back at a Grand Prix race in Belgium. A sinewy 5-foot-7  he favored short sleeves so he could get a suntan in his open cockpit. His seemingly casual slouch as he pushed howling machines to their limits was his signature. And his language elevated his sport almost to poetry. Motion  he said  was tranquillity. Why  he wondered  do people walk  since God gave them feet that fit automotive pedals? If people watch racing to witness the point where courage converges with catastrophe  Moss defined it. In 1962 at the Goodwood Circuit racetrack in England’s West Sussex County  a plume of fire shot from his Lotus 18/21 car. The crowd gasped. As Moss tried to pass Graham Hill  his car veered and slammed into an eight-foot-high earthen bank. It took more than a half-hour to free Moss from the wreckage. His left eye and cheekbone were shattered  his left arm broken and his left leg broken in two places. An X-ray revealed a far worse injury. The right side of his brain was detached from his skull. He was in a coma for 38 days  and paralyzed on one side of his body for six months. He remembered nothing of the disaster. He considered hypnosis to recover the memory  but a psychiatrist said that might cause the paralysis to return. When he left the hospital  he took all 11 nurses who had treated him to dinner  followed by a trip to the theater. A year later  he returned to Goodwood and pushed a Lotus to 145 m.p.h. on a wet track. He realized he was no longer unconsciously making the right moves. He said he felt like he had lost his page in a book. Though he believed he remained a better driver than all but 10 or 12 in the world  that was not good enough. He retired at 33. Moss was more than his talent. He was a beautiful name  one that still connotes high style a half-century after his crash  evoking an era of blazers and cravats  of dance bands and cigarette holders. One legend had him driving hundreds of miles in a vain effort to introduce himself to Miss Italy the night before a big race. His 16 books cemented his legend. So for a couple of generations  British traffic cops sneeringly asked speeding motorists  “Who do you think you are  Stirling Moss?” (Moss  who had been knighted  was once asked that question  and answered  “Sir Stirling  please.”) Moss said a name like Bill Smith just would not have done. But what about Hamish  the old Scottish name his mother  Aileen  had proposed? His father  Alfred  deemed that ghastly. The compromise was Stirling  the name of a town near his mother’s family home. Stirling Craufurd Moss was born in London on Sept. 17  1929. Both his father and mother had raced cars  with his father having competed twice in the Indianapolis 500  finishing 16th in 1924  while studying dentistry in Indiana. Stirling grew up excelling at horsemanship  but said he gave it up because horses were hard to steer. His passion was cars. As a boy  Stirling was allowed to sit on his father’s lap and steer the family car. When he was 10 he begged for and received the present of a very old and dilapidated seven-horsepower Austin. He made his own private racing circuit on the family farm. At 18  he got his first driver’s license and bought into a Cooper 500 racing car  winning 11 of the first 15 races he entered. Within two years  he was racing across Europe in numerous classes of cars. In 1953  he became a full-time driver on the Grand Prix circuit  the sport’s big league. His first Grand Prix vehicle was his own Maserati  not a machine from the respected Maserati stable. In 1955  he joined the Mercedes-Benz team  led by his idol  Juan Manuel Fangio. That year  Moss became the first British driver to win the British Grand Prix  edging out Fangio by two-tenths of a second. For years  Moss asked Fangio if he had lost on purpose. Fangio kept saying no. In 1956  Moss again drove a Maserati  followed by two years with the British Vanwall team. He won nine of 23 events. From 1959 to 1961  he drove two British makes  Cooper and Lotus  and won half of the 54 events he entered in his last year of racing. Moss’s first two marriages ended in divorce. Besides his wife  Susie  he is survived by his son  Elliot; his daughter  Allison Bradley; and several grandchildren. His sister  Pat Moss Carlsson  one of the most successful female rally drivers of all time  died in 2008. After his racing career  Moss made a tidy living selling his name and making personal appearances. “Basically  I’m an international prostitute ” he said. He made successful real estate investments and returned to the track for vintage car meets. He puttered around London on a motor scooter. Moss  the ultimate pro  once observed that there are no professionals at dying — although he had practiced. He was sure he was “a goner” after his steering column snapped at over 160 m.p.h. in a race in Monza  Italy  in 1958. As he staggered away from the wreckage  he thought  “Well  if this is hell  it’s not very hot  or if it’s heaven  why is it so dusty?” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/obituaries/12moss1/merlin_171518733_25ca7a25-fc8a-495a-80a9-63ef52b22abe-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Souza  India’s Anti-Establishment Artist, Souza  who started a collective of renegade artists in 1947  embraced the sacred and profane in erotically charged images. Several of his paintings fetched record auction prices for Indian art., Supported by Souza  who started a collective of renegade artists in 1947  embraced the sacred and profane in erotically charged images. Several of his paintings fetched record auction prices for Indian art. By William Grimes Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths  beginning in 1851  went unreported in The Times. In 1949  curious art lovers in Bombay (now Mumbai) gathered at the Art Society of India to see the work of a rising young painter named Francis Newton. They were in for a surprise. On the gallery’s center wall hung an expressionistic self-portrait of the artist  stark naked  paintbrush in hand  looking directly at the viewer with total assurance and a complete lack of shame. Nearly six feet tall  it made a powerful impression. A scandal ensued. The police rushed in  covering up the figure’s private parts. Obscenity charges were filed. Then  after removing all four paintings in the show  the police raided the artist’s studio in a search for pornographic material. Once again  Newton  who soon gained fame under the name F.N. Souza  his actual surname  had delivered on the promise of his Progressive Artists’ Group  a handful of like-minded renegades who favored an assertively modern approach  incorporating such Western influences as Cubism  Expressionism and Art Brut. Souza founded the group in 1947  just months after India gained its independence from British colonial rule. The goal  he wrote in the manifesto-like catalog essay for the group’s first major exhibition  at the Bombay Arts Society in July 1949  was a “new art for a newly free India.” No one embodied this spirit more than Souza  with a rebellious nature he exhibited from childhood. He was born Francisco Victor Newton de Souza on April 12  1924  in Saligao  Goa  a Portuguese colony in the south of India  to Roman Catholic parents. His father  José Victor Aniceto Piedade de Souza  an English teacher who went by the name Joe Newton  died just three months after his son was born. Within a few years the boy was taken to Mumbai by his mother  Lilia Maria Cecilia (Antunes) de Souza  who started a successful dressmaking business. He was expelled from St. Francis Xavier’s College  a secondary school  for inscribing erotic doodles on the wall of the boys’ room. He protested that he had merely “corrected” an existing drawing. At 16  he enrolled in the Sir J.J. School of Art  where he chafed at the strict academic approach and again ran into trouble. In 1945  along with other politically active students  he was suspended for his activities in support of Gandhi’s Quit India movement and never returned. On the day of his suspension  he went home in a rage and immediately began painting. The result was “The Blue Lady ” a nude he created by squeezing pigment directly from the tube onto a sheet of plywood and spreading the paint around with a palette knife. “It was an angry  impulsive picture  and in painting it he discovered the way he wanted to paint ” Edwin Mullins wrote in “F.N. Souza: An Introduction” (1962). Souza spent time in Goa  painting rural landscapes and portraits of poor laborers in a style reminiscent of Gauguin  then returned to Mumbai  where he began showing his work at the Bombay Art Society and gathered the coterie that became the Progressive Artists’ Group  among them Maqbool Fida Husain and Sayed Haider Raza. In 1949  after taking part in an exhibition of Indian art at the Royal Academy of Arts the previous year  he set sail for London. He toiled in obscurity until catching the eye of the poet Stephen Spender  who introduced him to Peter Watson  a well-connected collector and philanthropist. A group show with Francis Bacon  Henry Moore and others followed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1954. A year later Spender published Souza’s autobiographical essay  “Nirvana of a Maggot ” in Encounter magazine. His career took off when Victor Musgrave  the owner of the pioneering Gallery One  began selling his work. It was in the 1950s and ’60s  fusing stylistic elements drawn from classical Indian art  African tribal art and Western modernism  that Souza produced some of his most notable works. He expanded his reach beyond landscapes and portraits to embrace the sacred and profane in erotically charged images  teetering at times on the edge of violence  and religious subjects like the crucifixion and the Last Supper. “With a few slashing lines and a raw  expressive energy  Francis Newton Souza stripped away all subterfuge ” The Times of India wrote in a 2010 review of a retrospective of his work at the Dhoomimal Gallery in New Delhi. “Be it the sluts or the suits  the seamy side of life or the steamy  the gnomish  pox-scarred boy from Goa who went on to become one of the first Indian artists to be feted in the salons of Europe  laid it bare.” His brutal “Crucifixion” (1959)  purchased by the Tate in 1993  showed a black  jagged-edged Christ  “scourged and dripping  with matted hair tangled in plaited thorns ” as Souza described it in his collection “Words and Lines” (1959). Several of the paintings from this period later fetched record auction prices for Indian art. “Birth” (1955)  depicting a nude  heavily pregnant woman whose delivery is attended by a man in priestly garb  sold for $2.8 million in 2008  and then for $4 million when resold in 2015. His “black paintings ” first exhibited in 1966 at the Grosvenor Gallery in London  adopted many of his recurring themes  but rendered in a nearly all-black palette. In 1967 he moved to New York and returned to brighter colors  applied in a brushy  expressionistic manner  like the wildly exuberant “Oklahoma City” (1971)  one of several cityscapes and landscapes that reflected his travels around the United States. He also embarked on a series of experimental works in which he used chemicals to dissolve the ink on magazine pages  catalogs or photographs and superimpose new images. A long period of neglect ended after his death  on March 28  2002  while visiting Mumbai. The cause was complications of a heart attack. He was 77. His art would find new admirers. Tate Britain  as part of the 2018 exhibition “All Too Human: Bacon  Freud  and a Century of Painting Life ” set aside an entire room showcasing 10 of his works. Later that year  the Asia Society in New York included several of Souza’s works in “The Progressive Revolution: Modern Art for a New India ” a show devoted to the Progressive Artists’ Group  and a stirring reminder of Souza’s headlong charge into the future. “We were bold and full of fire ” Souza told The Times of India in 1989. “We were forging a modern Indian art with a blast!” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/lens/13overlooked-souza-01/00overlooked-souza-01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/arts/design/deborah-roberts-artist-virus-austin.html, arts design, A Dream Deferred  for Now, The coronavirus has pushed Deborah Roberts’s art exhibition at the Contemporary Austin at least to January. She is looking at the postponement as a gift., Supported by The coronavirus has pushed Deborah Roberts’s art exhibition at the Contemporary Austin at least to January. She is looking at the postponement as a gift. By Robin Pogrebin Deborah Roberts could have given up long ago. With a mother who worked as a maid and a father who worked as an electrical lineman for the city of Austin  Tex.  she grew up trading her drawings of cars  horses  dolls and airplanes for her classmates’ fat red pencils. “It meant nothing to them  but it was everything to me ” she said. “I did not know what an artist was. I just knew that I wanted to do this.” Her parents did not understand her passion. “My daddy hated art and said it was never going to be nothing ” Ms. Roberts said. “He would say  ‘What are you doing that for?’” “I learned to get a thick skin when I was about 25 ” she added. “Nothing anyone can tell you is ever going to make you stop doing it.” That resolve is finally paying off. At age 57  Ms. Roberts is about to have her first solo museum exhibition — a big deal for any artist  but especially gratifying for one who  four years ago  was working in a shoe store to pay the bills. “She’s worked for so long without any institutional recognition ” said Hallie Ringle  the curator of contemporary art at the Birmingham Museum of Art who helped organize “Fictions ” the 2017 show at the Studio Museum in Harlem that included Ms. Roberts. “What she hasn’t done  though  is let that stop her.” Ms. Roberts  who has a big personality and a bigger smile  also hasn’t let the pandemic set her back  though it has pushed her debut at the Contemporary Austin in Texas to January from September — assuming the virus abates by then  as hoped. Instead she is looking at this delay as something of a gift: to press the pause button on a career that had started to accelerate faster than felt comfortable  and to make entirely new paintings for her show  which will now be informed by this challenging cultural moment. “It just gives me time to be greater ” Ms. Roberts said  “to really flesh out this work.” In this way  Ms. Roberts exemplifies where many emerging artists find themselves during the coronavirus quarantine  which is where they always are — in their studios  making work that may never sell; deploying well-honed habits of toiling in isolation; and drawing strength from the creative process that has long sustained them. While group shows are gratifying  Ms. Roberts had just begun getting coveted individual recognition. Institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Brooklyn Museum have acquired her work  which explores notions of beauty  identity and race through collage-based portraits of black children. Celebrities who have purchased pieces include Beyoncé  Ava DuVernay and Barack Obama. Some even liken Ms. Roberts’s collages to those of the major American modernist Romare Bearden. “Roberts borrows from Bearden’s vocabulary but distills it into her own powerful language ” Elizabeth Fullerton wrote last year in Art in America  “capturing her subjects in a fragile state of becoming.” Just four years ago Ms. Roberts was selling her work for $250 to $600; now her pieces draw from $30 000 to $150 000. Having worked almost exclusively on paper  she can afford to spread out on canvas. And where she used to work in her cramped bedroom  Ms. Roberts now has a proper studio in Austin and just recently built herself a bigger house  where she moved in just before the virus outbreak. But Ms. Roberts said she has always considered herself “a successful artist.” “Maybe not monetarily  but I’ve always honored my work ” she said. “This is the reason I’m here.” A high school art teacher urged her on and taught her drawing and painting. “All praise and glory go to her ” Ms. Roberts said. “Well  it goes to God  but she’s next.” Ms. Roberts graduated with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the University of North Texas in 1985 and earned a master’s in fine art  from Syracuse University  in 2014. Her early work reflected the sheltered world of her childhood  in which people went to church and the violence that can accompany racism was remote. “I used to draw and paint like Norman Rockwell  but it was black Americana ” Ms. Roberts said. “I grew up with women who would sit on the porch all day and dare you to get in their yard. Maybe it was sentimental or romantic  but it was real to me. When I started painting  I was painting that.” Then she read essays by Cornel West  in which he talked about the power of the black body and how it was a taboo subject in white America. “It just shook me to the core ” she said. “I did not know I was black until I was in the sixth grade ” she added  “till the second round of busing  when a white teacher hated me from the moment she saw me.” Having started by using images of her own 8-year-old face  Ms. Roberts soon found inspiration in the faces of other children  like those from Africa and Haiti. She started with girls — exploring how society views them as well as how they view themselves — and recently began incorporating boys. “I’m looking for this type of innocence that has not been touched by pop culture but maybe has been touched by tragedy ” she said. “I know when I find that face.” Ms. Roberts’s work has moved some distance from the Norman Rockwell days; her 2018 mixed-media painting  “Facing the Rising Sun” refers to 14-year-old George Stinney Jr.  who in 1944 was wrongfully convicted of murdering two white girls in South Carolina. Dressed in a too-big prison uniform  Stinney was forced to sit on a book so he could fit in the electric chair. (The conviction was later vacated.) “She uses different clothing  patterns and tropes like boxing gloves and checkered uniform skirts — these elements that might seem incongruous — and puts them together in collages that are deceptively simple ” said Heather Pesanti  chief curator at the Contemporary Austin  who is organizing the forthcoming show. “She creates these new whole individuals from fragmented parts as a way to tell her own story.” No matter how hard it has been at times to make a living  Ms. Roberts has kept on making art. “She’s a fighter ” said Jeanne Klein  a prominent Texas art collector who has become a close friend. “I never had to fight like that.” When she found herself forced to work in a shoe store four years ago  Ms. Roberts did almost cry uncle. Then she received a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation  which she said “allowed me to eat.” “I’m a fat girl ” she added  laughing  “so I needed to eat.” Then in 2017  things took a meaningful turn: in the span of just a few months  Ms. Roberts’s work appeared in New York at the Volta Art Fair  the Fort Gansevoort gallery and the Studio Museum. Major dealers took notice  including Stephen Friedman in London and Susanne Vielmetter in Los Angeles  both of whom now represent Ms. Roberts. Her first visit to Ms. Roberts’s studio  Ms. Vielmetter said  echoed her experience with Mickalene Thomas  Nicole Eisenman and Wangechi Mutu: “There was no question about how I felt: This is very  very important work.” While it can take artists time to gain leverage in their careers  Ms. Roberts has already been making clear demands  namely that she wants her work to go to museums  where children who look like her can be inspired by her story. And she is allowing the virus crisis to influence new paintings — gravitating toward black backgrounds  for instance  instead of her usual white; and using the time for self-reflection. “This virus has made us scared of other people ” Ms. Roberts said. “Where we used to make eye contact and meet people  now we want to be in the shadows. We don’t want people to see us.” But Ms. Roberts’ work is all about wanting to be seen. “Allowing people to be in my presence  to feel what I feel when people make comments about my hair or my body ” she said. “While I want to be in the chorus of black women talking about black womanhood  I also want to have my own solo voice.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/arts/12VIRUS-ROBERTS1/12VIRUS-ROBERTS1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/pogrebin-robin/pogrebin-robin-thumbLarge.png 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/europe/pope-easter-mass-coronavirus.html, world europe, Pope Francis Says the Coronavirus Is ‘Testing Our Whole Human Family’, Standing in a nearly deserted St. Peter’s Basilica on Easter Sunday  the pontiff called for solidarity around the world to confront the pandemic., Supported by Standing in a nearly deserted St. Peter’s Basilica on Easter Sunday  the pontiff called for solidarity around the world to confront the pandemic. By Elisabetta Povoledo ROME — On an Easter Sunday like few others in modern history  Pope Francis said Mass under the soaring ceilings of St. Peter’s Basilica  which was virtually empty of the faithful. Outside  St. Peter’s Square  too  was bereft of the usual throngs of worshipers  who were forced to stay away because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year  an estimated 70 000 pilgrims crammed into St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City on Easter morning to hear the leader of the world’s Catholics deliver his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) message after Easter Mass. But congregants are prohibited from gathering there this year because of lockdown rules in Italy  which has had the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Europe. Faced with a flock that was seeking hope in a time of calamity  the Vatican streamed the pope’s message live for a global audience. Addressing “a world already faced with epochal challenges and now oppressed by a pandemic severely testing our whole human family ” Francis spoke of “the contagion of hope.” The pope acknowledged that for many  “this is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorrow and hardship that the pandemic is causing  from physical suffering to economic difficulties.” He said his thoughts were with those directly affected by the virus: doctors and nurses  the sick  those who had died and their family members in mourning. God is with us  he said  “firmly reassuring us: Do not be afraid  I have risen and I am with you still.” Along with the medical workers fighting the pandemic  more than 100 priests in Italy have died after contracting the virus as clergy and nuns have joined the battle. Acknowledging those who face an uncertain economic future and fears of unemployment  the pontiff called on political leaders “to work actively for the common good  to provide the means and resources needed to enable everyone to lead a dignified life and  when circumstances allow  to assist them in resuming their normal daily activities.” “This is not a time for indifference ” Francis said  “because the whole world is suffering and needs to be united in facing the pandemic.” Around the globe  other leaders and venerated figures delivered Easter messages stressing resilience. In Britain  Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday night released what was believed to have been her first Easter address  in which she said that the religious holiday was a time of “light overcoming darkness.” “This year  Easter will be different for many of us  but by keeping apart we keep others safe ” she said in the audio recording. “Easter isn’t canceled. Indeed  we need Easter as much as ever.” “We know that coronavirus will not overcome us ” the queen said. “As dark as death can be  particularly for those suffering with grief  light and life are greater. May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.” The archbishop of Canterbury  Justin Welby  held Britain’s first national digital Easter Sunday service from his kitchen in London. He spoke of “a very difficult time  in the life of the nation and of the world ” and said his prayers were with those who were suffering  those who cared for them and those who mourn. The archbishop of Panama also went up in a helicopter to bless the country; Christians in Spain have played religious music from their balconies; and the Philippines has urged the faithful not to kiss the cross  according to news reports. In his message on Sunday  the pope called on world leaders to care for the poor  refugees and homeless people. He urged the relaxation of international sanctions  saying they hinder countries from adequately supporting their citizens. And he demanded the reduction  “if not the forgiveness ” of the debts of the poorest nations so that they could best “meet the greatest needs of the moment.” Francis urged a “global cease-fire in all corners of the world” and an end to conflicts and hostilities in Syria  Yemen  Iraq  Lebanon and many African countries  and for renewed dialogue in the Middle East. He also called for unity and solidarity within the European Union  which “is presently facing an epochal challenge  on which will depend not only its future but that of the whole world.” The pandemic  he added  should not obscure the grave humanitarian crises that has crippled may parts of the world  citing those in Mozambique  Greece  Turkey  Libya and Venezuela. “Indifference  self-centeredness  division and forgetfulness are not words we want to hear at this time. We want to ban these words forever ” Francis said. May Christ “dispel the darkness of our suffering humanity and lead us into the light of his glorious day  a day that knows no end ” he said  Then he wished all a “happy Easter ” and gave his blessing.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/europe/boris-johnson-coronavirus.html, world europe, Boris Johnson Leaves U.K. Hospital After Coronavirus Treatment, In an emotional five-minute video  the British prime minister thanked the National Health Service  declaring it had “saved my life  no question.”, Supported by In an emotional five-minute video  the British prime minister thanked the National Health Service  declaring it had “saved my life  no question.” By Mark Landler LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was discharged from the hospital on Sunday  a major step forward in his recovery from the coronavirus and a welcome relief for a nation whose political leadership has been harder hit by the contagion than that of any other Western country. Mr. Johnson  who spent three nights in intensive care at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London  will convalesce for some time at Chequers  the prime minister’s country house  the government said in a statement. But he will soon be able to sign off on major decisions  including when to ease the country’s lockdown. In an emotional five-minute video  Mr. Johnson thanked the country’s National Health Service  declaring it had “saved my life  no question.” Wearing a suit and tie  but looking and sounding fatigued  Mr. Johnson singled out two nurses from New Zealand and Portugal who  he said  had kept a vigil over him “when things could have gone either way.” “The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed ” Mr. Johnson said. As he did when he first announced he had contracted the virus two weeks ago  the prime minister sought to draw a broader lesson from his own ordeal — in this case  that the country’s strict lockdown was enabling the National Health Service to perform as heroically for all Britons as it had for him. Mr. Johnson said nothing about his own plans for recuperation  but Downing Street said in a statement  “On the advice of his medical team  the P.M. will not be immediately returning to work.” Britain’s foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  had been deputized by Mr. Johnson to carry out his duties during his illness  a role Mr. Raab is likely to play somewhat longer. The absence of a formal succession plan in the country had raised questions about who would take charge if the prime minister died or was incapacitated for an extended period. Now  those fears have subsided  though it may still be weeks before Mr. Johnson retakes his place at the center of British politics. Full recovery from a serious case of the virus is lengthy and arduous  medical experts say  and Mr. Johnson’s family has warned that he should not return to work too soon. “He has to take time ” his father  Stanley Johnson  told BBC Radio on Friday. “I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.” Britain is still in a desperate phase of its battle with the pandemic. The death toll topped 10 000 on Sunday  and experts warned that the peak of the outbreak was still to come. Hospitals  though badly stretched and suffering an acute shortage of protective gear  have coped with the surge of patients. Britain is also struggling to ramp up its testing after a slow start amid internal debates over how aggressively to try to curb the spread of the virus. It has set an ambitious goal of testing 100 000 people a day by the end of April. Mr. Raab said the government would not lift the lockdown on Monday  the date Mr. Johnson set on March 23 to review the restrictions. As in other countries  British officials are engaged in a vexing debate over reopening the economy  and risking new outbreaks  or leaving it closed  and causing lasting damage. While Mr. Johnson will not attend those meetings  he will most likely play an influential role in that decision. The prime minister said on March 27 that he had tested positive for the virus  but continued to work  taking part in daily meetings about the pandemic by video while in isolation in his apartment next door to 10 Downing Street. Officials initially said they expected him to come out of isolation after a week. But Mr. Johnson continued to suffer a cough and high temperature  and his condition worsened until the evening of April 5  when he was moved to St. Thomas’  across the Thames River from Parliament. His hospitalization was announced about an hour after a rare address to the nation by Queen Elizabeth II  a juxtaposition that left many in the country unsettled. The government offered reassuring  if unrevealing  updates about Mr. Johnson  who was invariably described as being in “good spirits.” But top officials  including Mr. Raab  conceded that they had not spoken to the prime minister since before he was admitted to the hospital  sowing doubts about his condition. Then  on April 6  the prime minister was moved into the intensive care unit and given oxygen treatment. The government said Mr. Johnson did not require a ventilator  a development that typically reduces the chances of survival. But his sudden deterioration alarmed colleagues and members of his family  and his own description of his experience suggests his condition was far more perilous than the reports indicated. “There were times last week that were very dark indeed ” Mr. Johnson’s girlfriend  Carrie Symonds  said on Twitter on Sunday after his release. “My heart goes out to all those in similar situations  worried sick about their loved ones.” Ms. Symonds  32  is herself recovering from symptoms of the virus. She is pregnant  and the couple have announced plans to get married. Three days after entering intensive care  Mr. Johnson had improved enough to be transferred to a ward  where officials said he was sitting up and even taking short walks. While in hospital  Mr. Johnson was reported to have been watching movies that his Downing Street staff had put on a disc for him. One of them was “Love Actually ” the 2003 romantic comedy that he appropriated for a campaign advertisement during last year’s election  when he was filmed turning up on a doorstep to plead for a woman’s vote with flashcards. Mr. Johnson acknowledged he had never watched the film. In his video  Mr. Johnson sounded a bit stunned by what he had just gone through. He called the virus  “a fight we never picked against an enemy we still don’t entirely understand.” But in keeping with his role as the chief messenger of the government’s slogan “Stay Home. Protect the N.H.S. Save Lives ” Mr. Johnson kept his focus on his firsthand exposure to the pressures facing the National Health Service. Mr. Johnson lavished praise on the doctors had treated him  “several of them for some reason called Nick ” he said  “who took some crucial decisions a few days ago for which I will be grateful for the rest of my life.” He saved his most personal words for the rotating staff of nurses  naming nearly a dozen and singling out “Jenny from New Zealand” and “Luis from Portugal ” who were at his bedside during the frightening overnight hours. “Across this country  24 hours a day  for every second of every hour ” he said  “there are hundreds of thousands of N.H.S. staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/world/12virus-boris-topsub/merlin_171527559_81b0fc3a-0119-4763-9ba1-21f76a30ecba-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v3.png 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-mossad.html, world middleeast, Israel’s Not-So-Secret Weapon in Coronavirus Fight: The Spies of Mossad, The Israeli intelligence agency has played an outsize role in acquiring the medical gear  and knowledge  needed in the pandemic., Supported by The Israeli intelligence agency has played an outsize role in acquiring the medical gear  and knowledge  needed in the pandemic. By Ronen Bergman TEL AVIV  Israel — When Israel’s health minister was found to be infected with the coronavirus early this month  all high-level officials in close contact with him were quarantined  including one who stood out: the director of the Mossad  the storied Israeli spy service. Mossad officers  primarily associated with covert operations abroad in the name of protecting Israel  are not normally in the business of public health. So Israelis were immediately intrigued. Why would the Mossad director  Yossi Cohen  a widely respected figure in the country  have even been in the same room as the health minister  Yaakov Litzman? Mr. Cohen’s powerful agency  it turns out  has been deeply involved in Israel’s fight against the virus  and has been one of the country’s most valuable assets in acquiring medical equipment and manufacturing technology abroad  according to Israeli medical and security officials. As countries around the world compete ferociously for limited supplies during the pandemic  they are turning to any help available  and flexing their muscles unapologetically. And with the Mossad having determined that Iran — struggling with its own coronavirus crisis — no longer represents an immediate security threat  the agency could afford to immerse itself in the health emergency  according to multiple people knowledgeable about its operations. Initial predictions for the toll of the virus in Israel were dire  though so far they have proved too pessimistic. With nearly 11 000 cases of the virus now confirmed and 103 deaths  Israel does not rank among the hardest-hit countries in the world. “The peak expansion rate has been behind us for about two weeks now  and will probably wane almost completely within two weeks ” said an article published on Sunday by Prof. Isaac Ben Israel of Tel Aviv University. But in early February  officials at Sheba Medical Center  Israel’s biggest hospital  realized that they needed more ventilators and other gear. And around that time  Prof. Yitshak Kreiss  the director general of the hospital  met with Mr. Cohen  the Mossad chief  at a private event involving a mutual friend — not unusual in a small country where senior figures often move in the same social circles. By then  Mr. Cohen had already begun to assess how the Mossad could help the Israeli health system. Professor Kreiss said he enumerated the most urgent equipment needs to Mr. Cohen  who obtained further lists from the Health Ministry  and the Mossad began activating its international network to find the items needed. In early March  a command and control center was set up to handle the distribution of medical gear across the country  with Mr. Cohen at its head and headquartered at Sheba. There were representatives from the Mossad  the Ministry of Defense purchasing division  and the military intelligence’s highly secretive Unit 81  which deals with the development of advanced espionage equipment. Professor Kreiss  a former brigadier general in the army and a former surgeon general for the military  said the Mossad had been pivotal in helping his institution secure vital medical equipment and expertise from abroad. “It is only in Israel that the Sheba hospital could have enlisted the help of the Mossad ” he said in an interview. “Can you imagine Mount Sinai Hospital going to the C.I.A. for help?” he added  referring to the New York medical center. Professor Kreiss declined to say precisely how Mossad officers had helped the Israeli medical establishment or where the imported equipment came from. But according to six current or former Israeli officials with knowledge of the Mossad’s operations  the agency used international contacts to avert shortages that might have overwhelmed Israel’s health system. The six people  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Mossad’s activities are classified  said the spy agency’s contacts had proved invaluable in enabling Israel to acquire ventilators and testing material that Mr. Litzman’s health ministry had been unable to secure. Despite those efforts  however  there is still a lack of testing capacity in Israel. These people would not confirm non-Israeli media reports that some of the items were acquired from neighboring Arab nations with no official diplomatic relations with Israel. But at least one senior Mossad official acknowledged in an interview with Ilana Dayan  host of “Uvda ” or “Fact ” Israel’s Channel 12 TV newsmagazine  that in some instances  the agency had acquired items that other countries had already ordered. By the end of the first week of April  the people with knowledge of the operations said  Mr. Cohen was confident that Mossad operatives had ensured Israel would possess enough ventilators to cope with the worst forecasts. If Mr. Litzman  whose initially cavalier attitude toward the virus has been sharply criticized  symbolizes for some the shortcomings of the government’s response  for many Israelis the Mossad represents the opposite. Word of its assistance in fighting the pandemic has bolstered the Mossad’s image as among the country’s most admired government institutions. There was no time to waste  Professor Kreiss recalled  praising what he described as the single-mindedness of purpose shown by Mossad agents. “Part of their ethos is to execute their task at any price ” he said. That ethos has helped build Mossad’s reputation. It is best known for the capture of the Nazi fugitive Adolph Eichmann in 1960  its lethal response after the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics  and the 2018 theft of secret nuclear records from Iran  which Israelis regard as their most dangerous adversary. The agency has also had some high-profile failures  among them the botched assassination attempt in 1997 on Khaled Meshal  a senior figure in Hamas. To some extent  the Mossad’s intervention in the pandemic is an acute embarrassment for officials of the Health Ministry  who ordinarily speak freely to the media but declined to comment on any aspect of the spy service’s role. That the country’s health system had to enlist Mossad was evidence that it had not readied itself to respond to the type of threat represented by the coronavirus  according to a high-ranking figure in the Israeli health system  who requested anonymity because he was criticizing the ministry’s directorate. The first shipment acquired abroad by the Mossad arrived in Israel on a special flight on March 19: 100 000 coronavirus testing kits  said an official from the prime minister’s office. Subsequent shipments included more testing kits  1.5 million surgical masks  tens of thousands of N-95 masks  protective overalls for first-aid crews  protective goggles and a range of medications  according to a high-ranking official knowledgeable about the Mossad operation. The Mossad also helped obtain technology from outside Israel that have enabled many Israeli laboratories to conduct coronavirus tests. Mossad operatives also secured the necessary know-how to produce ventilators in Israel. Using technological expertise brought in by the Mossad  production lines that can produce 25 million protective masks a month are gradually being set up  a high-ranking security official said. According to one senior Israeli official  the Mossad knew it had to act urgently  with the demand for such equipment expected to grow and with the understanding that countries would eventually refuse to export essential medical products. The Mossad’s efforts were easier in nondemocratic countries where intelligence agencies have more influence with the rulers  this official said. The efforts were based on prior familiarity and mutual trust between the Mossad and those agencies. In some instances  the official said  Mr. Cohen personally contacted his counterparts. Such contacts were often enough to expedite purchase of the goods. In other cases  the official said  Mr. Cohen spoke directly to the rulers of particular countries  which he declined to identify. As other countries began to hunt for the same gear  competition intensified  and the battle was not always waged fairly. While none of the people with knowledge of the Mossad’s operations explicitly acknowledged that the agency may have played dirty  they did not rule it out. One recipient of the Mossad’s imports said some had come from China  where Israel’s Defense Ministry also helped secure medical equipment through a network usually used to buy weapons. The Mossad has invested heavily over the past decade in developing relations with states in the Middle East and Asia that remain hostile to Israel  at least officially. There have been a number of reports that Mr. Cohen has met frequently with the rulers and spy bosses of the United Arab Emirates  Egypt  Saudi Arabia  Jordan and Qatar. In 2018  Mr. Cohen set up an unusual public meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Sultan Qaboos of Oman  who died in January. Not all the Mossad coronavirus operations were successful. One of the people knowledgeable about the failures said Mossad emissaries had been outmaneuvered at least once in Germany  where government couriers seized goods the Israelis were about to ship home from a factory. Another time  a load of sanitizer in India was delayed by customs officers and the Mossad abandoned the shipment. Nevertheless  the Mossad will almost certainly be remembered for coming to the country’s rescue in an unusual battle against an invisible enemy.

By Carol Rosenberg This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. WASHINGTON — A leading defense lawyer who specializes in death penalty cases has been chosen to represent one of the five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11  2001  attacks before a military tribunal at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba  overcoming a key obstacle to the war crimes trial. But the national crisis over the coronavirus pandemic and the sudden  recent resignation of the military judge overseeing the trial still remain as hurdles to moving ahead in the complex conspiracy case. The lawyer  David I. Bruck  will represent Ramzi bin al-Shibh  a Yemeni accused of organizing a cell of men based in Hamburg  Germany  who were among the 19 hijackers who seized four passenger planes and slammed them into the World Trade Center  the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. Nearly 3 000 people were killed in the attacks. Mr. Bruck has handled several high-profile death penalty cases  including representing Dylann S. Roof  who killed nine black churchgoers in South Carolina in June 2015; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  one of the brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013; and Susan Smith  a woman in South Carolina who drowned her two young sons in 1994. Mr. Roof and Mr. Tsarnaev are on federal death row. Mr. Bruck  who has never been to the Navy base at Guantánamo Bay or practiced law in a military court  has not yet met or spoken with Mr. bin al-Shibh  the most volatile of the defendants in the capital case whose lead defendant is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Mr. bin al-Shibh is held at a maximum-security prison called Camp 7  which does not permit lawyers to speak with the prisoners they represent by videolink or telephone. The chief defense counsel for military commissions  Brig. Gen. John G. Baker  said he chose Mr. Bruck on Monday to succeed James P. Harrington  who had represented Mr. bin al-Shibh since arraignment in May 2012 and is leaving the case for health reasons. By law  each defendant charged in a death penalty case at the Guantánamo military commissions is entitled to a qualified capital defense lawyer  known as a learned counsel. The next step is for the overseer of the Office of Military Commissions  Christian L. Reismeier  a retired rear admiral  to formally hire Mr. Bruck as a contractor at the federal rate of $195 an hour. Colleagues describe Mr. Bruck  70  as courtly and soft-spoken as well as a good listener. Robert Dunham  the executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center  called him “one of the pioneering capital defense lawyers of the modern era.” Mr. Bruck has been defending capital cases at trial since 1980. He helped expand the body of information a sentencing jury can consider at death penalty trials through Supreme Court cases. And he has trained new generations of capital defenders  and helped legal teams that have insufficient resources through his legal clinic at the Washington and Lee law school in Virginia and as a founding member of the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel. In February  Mr. Harrington  75  citing health problems  obtained permission to leave the case from the judge  Col. W. Shane Cohen. Then last month  Colonel Cohen said he would retire from the Air Force for “the best interests of my family.” He leaves the case on April 24. No successor has been chosen. The departure of Colonel Cohen leaves unresolved the question of whether Mr. bin al-Shibh should be tried separately at a later date because of the considerable time it will take his new lawyer to prepare. General Baker noted that although Mr. Bruck had agreed to represent Mr. bin al-Shibh  Mr. Bruck will need “significant time to catch up with seven years’ worth of litigation.” He cited hundreds of legal motions  tens of thousands of pages of hearing transcripts and hundreds of thousands of pages of potential trial evidence. Among capital defense lawyers  Mr. Bruck is widely known for arguing Skipper v. South Carolina before the Supreme Court in 1986. The landmark ruling said that evidence of a convict’s behavior in jail after capture and potential for future dangerousness  based on testimony from mental health experts and prison guards  are relevant to a judge or jury deciding whether to sentence a convict to death. Lawyers for some of the defendants in the Sept. 11 trial have said the prisoners were so damaged by torture in C.I.A. detention in the years before their transfer to Guantánamo in 2006 that they would not be a threat to anybody should they be imprisoned for life. The judge initially set a trial date of January 2021 but postponed the start because the coronavirus has forced the Defense Department to prohibit most travel and office work. The next pretrial hearings are scheduled for late July  after Ramadan.

By Jennifer Steinhauer The bluebonnets popped up as ever this year  but the annual family portraits along the blooming Texas roadsides did not. There was no first pitch for the world champion Washington Nationals — their stadium has been turned into a center for feeding those in need. Passover dinners were attended by laptops  not loved ones  and Holy Week services were held in parking lots  if not on computer screens. The teenager who becomes a family’s first high school graduate probably won’t walk across a stage. Prom dresses will mostly sit in closets. Marathons that were trained for will have to wait. Weddings may be rescheduled  or they may happen in silent living rooms. Along with the horrific loss of life and the toll of millions of jobs  this socially distanced Easter represents an entire season of traditions and transitions altered  disrupted or canceled. Spring  normally a season of hope  instead has become a period of endless lost things. Still  in this season of rebirth  people do their best to make accommodations and fixes  to carry on as much as possible. Here are some of those ways. “The church calendar year is a human construction ” said the Rev. Dina van Klaveren  the rector of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Glenwood  Md.  who has turned to Facebook and Zoom to conduct the traditions of Holy Week. “As human beings  we need to frame time ” she said. “We need to have these ritual moments  do symbolic action  as an outside sign of inward reality.” So Daisy the donkey  who leads the annual Palm Sunday parade  was beamed via Facebook to parishioners. A small service  held each year on Maundy Thursday  includes the ancient custom of foot washing; this year  the Rev. van Klaveren demonstrated via video how to partake in the ritual at home. (Her teenagers took a pass.) On Maundy Thursday  it is also traditional to strip the church altar of its ornaments as a symbol of the humiliation of Jesus. “We don’t need to strip the altar this year ” she said. “Everything has already been stripped away.” The last funeral that Steve Leder conducted was graveside in groups of two. “A burial is not something that you will appreciate more next year because you could not do it this year ” said Mr. Leder  the senior rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles. “Funerals are where this virus shows  in the starkest relief  how much it has taken from the human experience of gathering together.” But he framed the passover Seder — this year  a small event with his wife and son and family via a laptop on the table — differently. It is  he said  a way to “create a certain sense of gratitude for what was in the past. Last year’s Seder seems that much sweeter  as will next year’s. Not that any of this is worth the terrible pain of this spring.” Jettisoning the rituals of shopping  cooking and “getting the asparagus on the table before the brisket gets cold ” he said  “may well heighten the actual meaning of the rituals.” “We can understand what God is by first understanding what God is not ” he added. “What it is really about is the remarkable and beautiful way that certain things flourish when we stop doing other things.” Especially for many African-American families  spring heralds the beginning of family reunion season. Candace Berry-Vaughn of Orangeburg  S.C.  rotates each year between her husband’s family and hers. This year  about 80 people from her husband’s family were planning to gather in West Palm Beach  Fla.  for a gathering that usually stretches over three days of family games  large themed meals  dance parties and church attendance  with a large dose of genealogy lessons thrown in. Now she is thinking back wistfully on reunions from the past  like the event she organized in Charleston in 2018. Armed with ancestry data  her family learned that many members could trace their roots to the slave trade ships that docked there. She organized a scavenger hunt  a picnic  dinners featuring the state’s traditional foods and games in which the family tree was reconstructed. The weekend closed with a service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  where nine members of the congregation were killed by a racist gunman during a Bible study in 2015. Ms. Berry-Vaughn hopes to resume the reunions  but wonders about the future. “We are actually a little concerned about how might this change family reunions and the new norms ” she said. “Will people still come? No one is going to want to hug and kiss on your grandmother anymore.” There are rabid Chicago Cubs fans  and then there is Rob Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez  65  who lives in Chicago  acutely remembers his first game  when he was 10 years old and caught a fly ball before he could even settle into his seat in the upper deck in Wrigley Field. “In Chicago  we have a long winter ” Mr. Rodriguez said  and opening day is the city’s robin of spring. “There was always a guy on the radio who would start with a prayer  and you would think of all you’ve been through. By the second game of the year  you don’t think about it. But something about opening day makes you think about our history.” Opening day for him has shifted over the decades. In his 20s  it was “a big huge party.” In his 40s  he went to opening day at the field “10 years in a row.” By the time his 50s rolled around  he would hit a bar near the stadium  “have a few beers  then go home and watch the game on TV.” For now  it’s Game Seven of the 2016 World Series  in which the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians to win their first World Series since 1908. He watches it regularly on You Tube. “It still makes me cry ” he said  adding  ”But I am just dying for this season to start.” Flowers bloom and birds migrate and animal offspring come into the world whether humans are there to witness them or not. But with closed sanctuaries and scotched field trips  many spring forays into the natural world will have to wait for another year. In Texas  bluebonnet tours have quieted along the highways  and monarch migration  along with that of purple martins  scissor-tailed fly catchers and painting buntings  may be missed. “Normally this time of year  we are running all over the state ” said Mary Pearl Meuth  who works with the Texas Master Naturalist Program at Texas A&M University. “This year  I am focusing on my own back yard.” In Southern California  residents are missing the annual ritual of the grunion runs — a spectacle of chasing the slender  sardine-like fish that show up on California’s sandy shores each year. Families normally gather to catch the creatures  which glow at night  and roast marshmallows by moonlight. “Seeing a grunion run is all the more special because you have to be in the right place at the right time ” said Kirsten Macintyre  a spokeswoman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Like most high school students  Anjali Nair  16  a junior who lives in Fairfax  Va.  misses the social rituals of adolescence  but her hobbies are tied directly to spring. A teen pageant participant and a serious dancer  her 20 hours a week once spent in a studio have been replaced with dancing solo at home  pushing her mom’s exercise bike out of the way to make room for kicks and pliées. The spring dance concert is off. But the pageant spring season is when Miss Nair  who was crowned the national American Miss Junior Teen in 2019  is usually on the circuit encouraging other teenagers to join. Now she is mostly doing Instagram posts urging students to read and exercise and participate in remote dance classes. “I do dance in my living room and my kitchen and sometimes on my deck ” she said. “It was hard at first  but I moved some things around.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/us/00VIRUS-LOSTSPRING-bluebonnets/merlin_136043010_d9e802c2-046f-4d19-90ac-4298639cdce8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/autossell/maudythursdaystill/maudythursdaystill-superJumbo.jpg 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/obituaries/phyllis-lyon-dead.html, obituaries, Phyllis Lyon  Lesbian Activist and Gay Marriage Trailblazer  Dies at 95, When Ms. Lyon married her partner of 55 years in 2008  they formed the first legal gay union in California., Supported by When Ms. Lyon married her partner of 55 years in 2008  they formed the first legal gay union in California. By Julia Carmel Phyllis Lyon  who when she married her partner  Del Martin  in 2008 became part of the first legal same-sex union in California  died on Thursday at her home in San Francisco. She was 95. Her sister  Patricia Lyon  confirmed the death. It was not their first wedding. In 2004  despite state and federal bans on same-sex marriage  Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Ms. Lyon and Ms. Martin were the first to receive one  but that union would be short-lived. The California Supreme Court invalidated their marriage a month later  arguing that the mayor had exceeded his legal authority. Four years later  the same court declared same-sex marriages legal and Mr. Newsom invited the couple back as the first to be married under the new ruling. Ms. Martin died shortly after. “I am devastated ” Ms. Lyon said following her wife’s death. “But I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed.” The mauve and turquoise-blue suits that the couple wore to their weddings are in the permanent collection of the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco. Mr. Newsom  who is now the governor of California  said on Twitter: “Phyllis — it was the honor of a lifetime to marry you & Del. Your courage changed the course of history.” Phyllis Ann Lyon was born on Nov. 10  1924  in Tulsa  Okla. to William Ranft Lyon  a salesman  and Lorena Belle (Ferguson) Lyon  a homemaker. The family moved to Sacramento in the early 1940s. After graduating from the University of California  Berkeley  in 1946 with a degree in journalism  Ms. Lyon worked as a reporter for The Chico Enterprise-Record in Chico  Calif. She moved to Seattle in 1949 to work at a construction trade journal  where Ms. Martin was also employed. They began dating and  on Valentine’s Day in 1953  moved in together in San Francisco. In 1955  they joined three other lesbian couples to found the Daughters of Bilitis  one of the first lesbian political organizations in the United States. The name was inspired by “Songs of Bilitis ” a collection of lesbian love poems by Pierre Louÿs. “There were a lot of laws that were anti-gay  and there were more things to do than just party ” Ms. Lyon said in an interview for StoryCorps. “We decided we’d put out a newsletter  The Ladder.” The newsletter  which Ms. Lyon edited from its inception in 1956  grew into one of the first lesbian magazines in the country. It published until the group disbanded in the 1970s. Ms. Lyon and Ms. Martin also co-wrote two books: “Lesbian/Woman” (1972)  which won a Stonewall Book Award  and “Lesbian Love and Liberation” (1973). “There really weren’t any books” about lesbians when she was growing up  Ms. Lyon said in a 1992 interview with Terry Gross of the NPR program “Fresh Air.” “And then there was nothing that was any good in the libraries in those early days.” Throughout their 55-year relationship  Ms. Lyon and Ms. Martin were politically engaged. They were among the first lesbians to join the National Organization for Women  and Ms. Martin was later elected to its board of directors. The couple also helped form the Council on Religion and the Homosexual to persuade ministers to accept lesbians and gay men into churches. On the local level  they were members of the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club  San Francisco’s first gay political organization  which influenced the passage of a bill to ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. In 1979  local activists established the Lyon-Martin Health Services  a health care provider  in San Francisco. It is still in operation. “We were trying to help lesbians find themselves ” Ms. Lyon said in a 1989 interview. “I mean  you can’t have a movement if you don’t have people that see that they’re worthwhile.” Along with her sister  Ms. Lyon is survived by a daughter  Kendra Mon; two grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. Even after Ms. Martin’s death  Ms. Lyon continued advocating for lesbian rights. “If you got stuff you want to change  you have to get out and work on it ” she said in a 2017 interview with The Bay Area Reporter. “You can’t just sit around and say  ‘I wish this or that was different.’ You have to fight for it.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/obituaries/10lyon-sub/merlin_171451749_9de15ee5-737b-407e-ba30-1325d1550c26-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/biden-sanders-young-voters.html, opinion, Hey Kids: Get Out There and Vote!, Disappointed young progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters should consider the alternative., Supported by Disappointed young progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters should consider the alternative. By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. With Joe Biden the last man standing in the Democratic primary race for president  there is increasingly anxious discussion within the party about how — or even if — the former vice president can win over disappointed progressives. Of particular concern are the younger voters whose energy and idealism fueled the campaign of Bernie Sanders. On April 8  just hours after Mr. Sanders suspended his campaign  a collection of eight progressive groups “building political power for young people” sent Mr. Biden a four-page letter detailing how he could win their support. Their to-do list called on him to embrace a range of progressive policies — including Medicare For All  the “frameworks of the Green New Deal” and a wealth tax — as well as to add progressive advisers to his campaign and  later  his administration. “With young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next president  you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Trump ” they wrote. The next day  the former candidate Tom Steyer added his voice to the call  urging Mr. Biden to pursue young progressives. “There’s going to have to be a process to convert” them  Mr. Steyer told Politico. This is a daunting challenge. Mr. Biden is a 77-year-old moderate who has spent his entire adult life in politics and in many ways embodies The Establishment. So far  he has been running on a backward-looking platform of restoration — not exactly a message to electrify the youth vote. Yet regardless of how hard Mr. Biden might try to overhaul his image  the unfortunate electoral reality — dramatically spotlighted by the Sanders campaign — is that betting on the youth vote remains a losing proposition. An enduring truth of politics is that  whether in presidential years or midterm races  younger voters consistently turn out at a lower rate than older ones. (The 18-29 year olds trail the 30-44-year-olds  who trail the 45-59- year-olds. Voters 60 and up are the Election Day rock stars.) Until that changes  young people will have a tough time getting their concerns taken as seriously as they deserve. More than any other presidential contender in modern memory  Mr. Sanders built his candidacy around younger voters. He inspired them. He championed their issues. He explicitly cast them as the key to his success. While Mr. Biden held sway with voters age 45 and older  Mr. Sanders dominated with the under-45 crowd. And how did this work out for Mr. Sanders? Not well. In state after state  young voters’ enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders failed to translate into cold  hard votes. It’s not that the Democratic primary electorate was  on the whole  unmotivated. Before the coronavirus pandemic upended the country  overall turnout was exceeding turnout in 2016. But among younger voters  turnout was flat or down in many states. In the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday  participation by those younger than 30 did not top 20 percent  according to exit polls — which also showed these voters making up a smaller share of the electorate than in 2016. It’s not a mystery why young Americans are fed up with politics. The system feels rigged against them. Even politicians who profess to care about their problems rarely make things better. The current administration may most kindly be described as revanchist. Mr. Sanders struck many young people as their last  best hope — and made clear that he saw them as his. Fair or not  their inability to deliver on his behalf will not go unnoticed in political circles  and going forward  candidates will be that much more hesitant to pin their chances on this demographic. This is a terrible dynamic for young voters and for the nation. Moving America forward requires focusing on the future  which is hard for politicians to do when the electoral influence rests so heavily in the hands of older voters. But politicians go where the votes are  and older voters are reliable — even when they aren’t especially excited about a candidate. One unexpected voice making this point is Cardi B. In a hilarious  highly profane rant posted Thursday on Twitter  the 27-year-old rapper went after young people for not delivering for Mr. Sanders. “I’m seeing all over Twitter: ‘I love Bernie. I love Bernie.’ But y’all wasn’t voting. Y’all wasn’t voting!” she scolded. “Now  you know who be voting? Older people.” And on she went about how the nation is facing perilous times  how President Trump is not up to the challenge and how this is no time to be messing around by not voting. Cardi B may not be best known for her political punditry  but she is not wrong here. Sitting this election out for whatever reason would not serve young voters’ interests in the short or long term. They need to show up and be counted like never before  even if only to write in a protest candidate. Once they establish themselves as a reliable force  they won’t again have to beg and bargain with politicians to take them seriously.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/coronavirus-black-men.html, opinion, The Brother Killer, Many factors make blacks  especially black men  particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus., Supported by Many factors make blacks  especially black men  particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist A few weeks ago  Hannah Sparks of The New York Post reported on “a morbid — and chillingly astute — new slang term for the coronavirus pandemic: boomer remover ” because the virus has proved particularly deadly for the elderly. But  because it is also disproportionately deadly for men and for African-Americans  I worry about how it will affect black men in particular  and have come to use another chilling term to characterize it: a “brother killer.” And I fear that the worst may be yet to come  at least until treatments are developed and a vaccine discovered. There are silent populations of black men  largely removed from public view and public consciousness  who will remain vulnerable long after we “open the country back up ” whatever that looks like  and return to some semblance of normalcy. For these men  the devastating effects of this virus may be as much about pre-existing social conditions as pre-existing medical ones. These are the people living on the edge of society  existing in the shadows  our own iteration of untouchables  exempt from America’s sympathies — the homeless  the incarcerated  those living with H.I.V./AIDS. According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty  “people living on the streets  in shelters or in their cars are more vulnerable to an outbreak of highly communicable diseases like Covid-19.” The group attributes that vulnerability in part to “close quarters  compromised immune systems and an aging population” as well as the fact that “without adequate  permanent and stable housing  people lack a restroom for frequent hand washing  laundry facilities  and personal hygiene.” According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness  a total of 552 830 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2018. And while black people were only 13 percent of the population  they made up 40 percent of the homeless population. Furthermore  men are 70 percent of the homeless among individual adults. Who will even test this population for the virus? People with homes and jobs are finding it hard to get tests  and some are being outright refused. As the Pew Research Center pointed out last year  at the end of 2017 there were nearly a half a million people in federal and state prisons  and a plurality of those prisoners were black. Nine out of 10 inmates are male. There were nearly three-quarters of a million Americans held in local jails in 2018  and about a third of them were black  according to the Bureau of Prison Statistics. In fact  the rate at which black people were jailed was nearly three times the rate at which white people and Hispanics were jailed. The Cook County Jail in Chicago has emerged as a hot spot for the coronavirus and Covid-19  with more than 300 inmates and more than 200 employees testing positive for the virus. Seventy-three percent of the people in that jail are black and 93 percent are men. And  to add insult to injury  national data show that 70 percent of the people in local jails are not yet convicted of any crime. Many simply can’t afford to post bail  so they wait in jail on a trial for the charge or until they enter a plea to it. People living with compromised immune systems are also at risk. H.I.V./AIDS can lead to such a compromised system  particularly among those not in treatments and whose virus hasn’t been suppressed. Black men have the highest rate of new diagnoses of H.I.V. The H.I.V. prevalence rate for black people is eight times the rate for white people and nearly three times the rate for Hispanics. There are over a million Americans living with H.I.V. Nearly half a million of those are black. Only 61 percent of those black people received treatment for the virus in 2016 and only about half were able to suppress the virus. And H.I.V. is now heavily linked to poverty. In 2013  there were 282 100 Medicaid beneficiaries with H.I.V.  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  and they were “more likely to be male (56 percent vs. 42 percent)  or black (50 percent vs. 22 percent)” than the Medicaid population overall. Add to this the fact that poverty rates are highest among black people and blacks have the highest prevalence of disabilities  and you have a very real problem brewing. History has shown that we are callously comfortable averting our gaze away from men like these. We construct racialized rationales that allow us not to care  to say that they courted their fate  that pathology is at play  that one reaps what one sows. But  that can’t stand. These are human beings  with stories and souls  who love and are loved  who deserve  like all others  a fair chance to survive and prosper. Were it not for your accident of birth  these brothers could be your brothers. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/coronavirus-distancing.html, opinion, The One Kind of Distancing We Can’t Afford, The only way to fight this pandemic is through identification with its victims  not deliberate estrangement from them., Supported by The only way to fight this pandemic is through identification with its victims  not deliberate estrangement from them. By Jennifer Senior Opinion columnist Last week  within the space of just 24 hours  two friends of mine — one an I.C.U. nurse  the other an E.R. doctor — told me that they’d each watched a 50-year-old woman die of Covid-19. I  too  am a 50-year-old woman. As I listened to their stories  I had to stifle the same unlovely impulse. “But did your patients have a pre-existing condition?” I wanted to ask. “Were they fighting cancer  were they smokers  were they already floridly unwell?” Which is ridiculous  honestly. Even if their patients had a history of heart disease or were partial to Camels  they no more deserved to die a frightening and solitary death than anyone else. But my reaction  I think  was fairly typical of this exceptional moment  when reminders of our own mortality are never more than a few paces from our conscious  clattering minds: We are silently building moats that separate ourselves from the dead. It’s the other culturewide distancing campaign. The first  we know about: to socially distance  which is deliberate and altruistic. But this one  to psychologically distance from the suffering and the deceased  is more furtive and fraught. It is certainly understandable  and probably even adaptive. But we’d do well to guard against it. For Exhibit A  look no further than the Twitter account of David Lat  the 44-year-old lawyer  legal recruiter and founding editor of Above The Law  an immensely popular blog. Lat was diagnosed with Covid-19 in mid-March  and he’s tweeted about it ever since  save for the chilling stretch during which he was on a ventilator. When he returned  he posted a thread exploring the reasons some people die from Covid-19 while others suffer not at all. He was suddenly pelted with queries about his own health. People were subtly probing to see whether there was a hidden reason he’d fallen ill. I emailed Lat to ask him about this. (We would have spoken  but his voice is still ragged from intubation.) “Maybe I’m reading too much into things ” he replied  “but I received a number of responses that seemed to latch on excitedly to the mention of my exercise-induced asthma.” That he ran two New York City Marathons with this asthma in his 30s — and did high-intensity interval training three times a week until he fell ill — didn’t move a number of his followers. (The bluntest response: “Asthma is still asthma  waiting to knock you out  and any severe respiratory illness reveals the fundamental weakness of your lungs.”) Nor did the fact that Lat was healthy in every respect: normal blood pressure  normal weight  didn’t smoke  barely drank. “I have definitely had people trying to psychologically distance themselves from me and my case ” he said  “but I haven’t been surprised by these reactions — partly because  truth be told  I used to engage in them too.” In a way  this bias is a modified  pandemic-ready version of the just-world fallacy  the bias that makes us believe that good things ultimately happen to good people and bad things ultimately happen to bad ones. We’d all like to believe there’s a reason for a person’s ill luck. That bad luck might be insolently random  working its way through the world with pitiless indifference to who or what we are  is simply too upsetting. It is  of course  a natural instinct to fear our own mortality. In “The Denial of Death ” published in 1973  the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker went so far as to argue that our dread of dying is what motivates all of human behavior  that it’s responsible for the whole of culture  of civilization; how else to create meaning for ourselves? But it’s irresponsible when this denial affects our political rhetoric  especially during a historic pandemic. “The risk to the average American is low” went the Trump administration mantra for weeks on end — meaning that older Americans weren’t average  and neither were smokers  or people with heart disease or diabetes or compromised immune systems. Now we see that African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately dying  because they’re more apt to work high-exposure jobs and less apt to have access to high-quality health care. Are they not average either? And what of all the Americans who are dying of Covid-19 for reasons doctors can’t discern at all? How you speak about a disease matters  as Susan Sontag pointed out so long ago in “Illness as Metaphor.” It informs the very way that you treat it. When the president described Covid-19 as “the Chinese virus ” he wasn’t just deflecting blame for his slow response; he was explaining it. He thought of the novel coronavirus as something that happened only to Americans who went to China  or those who were in contact with people who had been to China. This was our testing policy for weeks. It was  once again  Donald J. Trump’s own form of psychological distancing  and it had lethal consequences. It’s little different from the mentality that led young people to go tra-la-la-ing on the beaches of Florida over spring break  oblivious to the notion that they might silently spread the disease to the busboys who cleared their food  the cashier who handed them their beer  or their parents who waited for them back home. (It was also foolish for them to believe they were completely immune: Statistics say otherwise.) The only way to fight this pandemic is through identification with its victims  not deliberate estrangement from them. As we spend weeks — months — in isolation  it’s our connectedness we ought to keep in mind. This virus affects us all. Je suis Covid.

12/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/business/coronavirus-traders-work-from-home.html, business, Working From Home Feeds Market’s Woes in Little Ways That Add Up, As traders scattered to their homes  sacrificing fast speeds  multiple screens and intricate setups  decisions took longer to communicate  slowing markets and adding uncertainty., Supported by As traders scattered to their homes  sacrificing fast speeds  multiple screens and intricate setups  decisions took longer to communicate  slowing markets and adding uncertainty. By Matt Phillips  Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly Toggling between two computer screens instead of four. Slower wireless connections. Plain old cellphones — missed calls and all — standing in for highly programmed devices that allow instantaneous connections. Instant messaging and video conferencing replacing quick bursts of conversation across a floor. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic forced thousands of traders  sales representatives  analysts  bankers and risk managers out of their workplaces and into their homes  the foot soldiers of finance have been making do with technology that’s far more ordinary than many of them are used to. The individual inconveniences are relatively minor — one trader missed a special Bloomberg keyboard  another struggled with having the chat window to his left instead of right — but together  they have had a noticeable impact on the functioning of markets  according to traders  investors and regulators. Over the last month  as much of the finance industry adjusted to working from home  the rapid-fire  split-second nature of global trading slowed slightly because communicating decisions took longer. And that  in turn  added a layer of unexpected friction to already volatile markets. “When people are in a new environment and using new systems  combined with market volatility  it slows things down a bit ” said Michael O’Brien  director of global trading at the Boston-based investment management company Eaton Vance. Of course  much of the recent choppiness in financial markets is tied to fears about the economic fallout of the pandemic  as people around the country shelter in place. But the sudden scattering of many of Wall Street’s traders from their hubs in Lower and Midtown Manhattan and toward a honeycomb of home offices and emergency backup locations introduced an element of discombobulation that few firms had prepared for. Traders around the country faced similar challenges. Mehmet Kinak  the global head of systematic trading at T. Rowe Price  an asset management company  used to sit with a group of about a dozen traders on the seventh floor of his company’s headquarters in Baltimore. Past the sea of screens — traders typically had three or four at their desks — were views of the National Aquarium and Camden Yards  the home of the Orioles. Now  Mr. Kinak logs in from his home office — a small room in the basement of his Elk Ridge  Md.  residence. Instead of engaging in constant chatter  his group connects via live chat tools such as Webex and Symphony. He’s noticed a slight slowdown in the pace of trading with partners on Wall Street as well  which he attributes to a combination of wild swings in markets and the transition to working from home. “It just takes a little bit more time ” said Mr. Kinak. “But incrementally  it adds up.” The global financial system is intricate and highly complex  made up of thousands of companies — banks  hedge funds  asset managers  trading specialists — that buy and sell trillions of dollars in assets like stocks  bonds and currencies for themselves or their clients. To do so  companies invest heavily in technology and have elaborate setups meant to simplify communication between trading desks  analysts and clients. Milliseconds make a difference in this environment  because prices can change swiftly. Some of this activity is deemed so important that President Trump last month declared banking employees “essential” to the functioning of the U.S. economy and exempted them from orders to stay at home or stop working. Some Wall Street employees are still going into the office — especially those on trading floors where activity is both highly regulated and customized  and difficult to replicate at home. Troy Rohrbaugh  the head of global markets at JPMorgan Chase recalled how  one day in mid-March  when the market was swinging wildly  a large client needed to sell a significant chunk of bonds. Mr. Rohrbaugh  who was in his office at the bank’s Midtown headquarters  stepped onto the trading floor to confer with a couple of traders and a salesman. “We were done and dusted and shelling a price to a client in two minutes  three minutes ” he said. “Can you imagine that conversation taking 30 minutes or longer in markets that are moving as rapidly as they are now?” He continues to work from the office despite a recent outbreak of Covid-19 there. Another company  Citadel Securities  a Chicago “market maker” that matches buyers and sellers  booked a hotel — the luxury Four Seasons resort in Palm Beach  Fla. — and set up a makeshift trading floor so it could continue to do business uninterrupted. But for the most part  financial companies have put in effect strict work-from-home policies. Traders say the impact of the transition has been the greatest in less transparent markets such as corporate bonds. Unlike stock markets  where exchanges provide real-time prices that traders can act upon at any moment  prices in so-called over-the-counter markets for bonds are often negotiated during each trade. On a typical trading desk  bond traders can gather price information  haggle with brokers and clients or check in with analysts and sales representatives with a few shouts or by pressing a button. By contrast  working from home requires phone calls and instant messages  which take more time  even as markets continue to trade and prices fluctuate before a decision can be made. “Trading floors are designed the way they are to most effectively and most efficiently socialize information ” said Joshua Younger  a bond market analyst at JPMorgan. Running a trading operation from home is like “a football team running a play by text ” he said. “It wouldn’t work as well. All the information would get conveyed  but not at the speed and the pace that’s required.” Government officials who monitor the smooth functioning of markets  and traders and investors who depend on it  note that slower connections have created lags leading to uncertainty — say  about whether a buy or sell order is coming through. Traders typically have three to four screens they use to keep a constant eye on price changes  communications from trading partners and market data sources. But at home  most probably have a laptop and another monitor  so more toggling and clicking is required to nail down the maturity schedule of a bond or call up the daily trading volume on a stock. The phone is another matter. Traders usually use a specialized telephone known as a “turret ” with preprogrammed keys to connect with important clients and trading partners. While there are electronic solutions that would allow traders to replicate their turrets online at home  many seem to have reverted to simply looking up numbers and using their cellphones to connect — another small but significant slowdown in communications. Jeff Warren  a Goldman Sachs banker who helped oversee the sale of $600 million in bonds on March 30 for the restaurant chain Yum Brands  found it much more onerous to deal with hundreds of investors from the attic of his mother-in-law’s home in Long Island than from the office. He said he joked to colleagues that while his Downtown Manhattan office has a phone turret that allows 600 calls to come through at once  he is barely able to patch together two lines on a desk phone while working remotely. The coronavirus outbreak threw a wrench into the continuity planning that many Wall Street companies had put in place since at least the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Those plans were largely built around the idea that if trading at a bank headquarters was knocked off-line  groups of traders would decamp to satellite trading floors outside the radius of whatever disaster had befallen New York. But those plans quickly became unworkable  given the dangers of infections from coronavirus for virtually all office work that puts people close to one another. “This is really not the disaster that they had planned for ” said Daniel Beunza  a business professor at the City University of London  who has studied and recently written a book on bank trading floor culture. The trading floor at Driehaus Capital Management  a boutique investment manager  occupies the second floor of a 19th century mansion in Chicago. On a typical day  a handful of traders — with four screens apiece — scour the markets for entry and exit points on the stocks and bonds the portfolio managers have earmarked for buying or selling. Now  all of the firm’s traders are working from home but the disruption has not been significant  said Jason Vedder  director of trading. In recent years  Driehaus had bolstered its ability to allow traders to work from home for a number of reasons — not least the ability to stay home during Chicago’s awful winter weather. That’s not to say nothing has changed. Instead of hearing nonstop chatter  the firm’s traders have an open Zoom video meeting going throughout the day  allowing them to mimic the ease of in-person communication. They also connect to Bloomberg  where they chat with their counterparts at Wall Street banks and execute trades. Mr. Vedder himself works from a third-floor office next to his son’s room in his home on the city’s North Side. He has hard-wired his desktop to increase its speed  and a 150-foot cable spills out of his office and down the stairwell to the modem in the basement. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/business/10JPvirus-wfhtraders-print/merlin_171381282_27cf6db6-3915-490c-89a1-9e4983105ea5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Now  He’s Fighting for Disney’s Life., The former C.E.O. thought he was riding into the sunset. Now he’s reasserting control and reimagining Disney as a company with fewer employees and more thermometers., Supported by the media equation The former C.E.O. thought he was riding into the sunset. Now he’s reasserting control and reimagining Disney as a company with fewer employees and more thermometers. By Ben Smith The Walt Disney Company turned franchises like Marvel and “Star Wars” into the biggest media business in the world  and last fall it was putting the finishing touches on the image of a storied character: its chief executive  Bob Iger. In late September  Mr. Iger  69  published “The Ride of a Lifetime ” an engaging work of self-hagiography. The handsome executive  who seriously considered running for president this year  spent the next month on the kind of media tour that Disney is known for: he reveled in the successful start of a streaming service that immediately rivaled Netflix  was hailed as “businessperson of the year” by Time and described as “Hollywood’s nicest C.E.O.” in an article in the The Times by Maureen Dowd. Even his friends wondered if the soft-focus Instagram ads produced for his MasterClass on leadership were a bit much. It all went so well that Mr. Iger decided it was time to do something he had postponed four times since 2013: retire as C.E.O. In early December  Disney executives say  he told his board that he was ready to leave. Around that time  a handful of people in Wuhan  China  began developing mysterious coughs. At the end of January  a few days after Disney was forced to close its Shanghai theme park as the coronavirus spread  Mr. Iger and the board stuck with their plan  agreeing that he would step back to become executive chairman and that the low-profile head of the parks and cruise business  Bob Chapek  would take over immediately as chief executive. They finalized the arrangement even as the stock market began to shudder. And on Feb. 25  they shocked Hollywood with the news that Mr. Iger’s 15-year run had ended. The seemingly abrupt announcement prompted intense speculation about the reasons for Mr. Iger’s exit. “Sex or health?” one media executive who knows him texted another that night. Two weeks later  a different question emerged: Had Mr. Iger  with his deep ties to China and legendary timing  seen the coronavirus about to devastate his global realm? Did he get out just in time? Mr. Iger  who has always carefully managed his image  told me in an email  there was no more than met the eye. “No surprises … nothing hidden … nothing different or odd to speculate about …. ” he wrote  ellipses and all. In fact  people close to Mr. Iger and the company said in interviews that the real question wasn’t whether he saw the crisis coming — but whether his focus on burnishing his own legacy and assuring a smooth succession left him distracted as the threats to the business grew. No big media company is more dependent on its customers’ social and physical proximity than Disney  with its theme parks and cruise lines. Few have been hit harder by the pandemic. And now  Mr. Iger has effectively returned to running the company. After a few weeks of letting Mr. Chapek take charge  Mr. Iger smoothly reasserted control  BlueJeans video call by BlueJeans video call. (Disney does not use Zoom for its meetings for security reasons.) The new  nominal chief executive is referred to  almost kindergarten style  as “Bob C ” while Mr. Iger is still just “Bob.” And his title is “executive chairman” — emphasis on the first word. Mr. Iger is now intensely focused on remaking a company that will emerge  he believes  deeply changed by the crisis. The sketch he has drawn for associates offers a glimpse at the post-pandemic future: It’s a Disney with fewer employees  leading the new and uncertain business of how to gather people safely for entertainment. “It’s a matter of great good fortune that he didn’t just leave ” said Richard Plepler  the former HBO chief. “This is a moment where people first and foremost are looking to an example of leadership that has proved itself over an extended period of time — and Bob personifies that.” The story of the Walt Disney Company since Mr. Iger’s predecessor  Michael Eisner  took it over in 1984 is one of astonishing growth that has become the model for the modern  global media business. The company turned its tatty icons like Mickey Mouse into cash cows. Mr. Iger has spent more than 40 years working for companies that are now part of Disney  and has earned his reputation through bold acquisitions. He bought Pixar  then Marvel  then Lucasfilm  for single-digit billions  and quickly created many more billions in value with them. Mr. Iger had the greatest job on earth  ruling not just a company but a “nation-state ” as California’s governor  Gavin Newsom  described Disney recently. But Disney’s much-imitated model was almost perfectly exposed to the pandemic. The shift from on-screen entertainment into in-person experiences helped Disney become the biggest media company in the world. But those businesses have been impossible to protect from the pandemic. The company’s largest division brought in more than $26 billion in the year ending last June by extending its brands to cruise ships and theme parks. Those are all shuttered now. It has three new cruise ships under construction in Germany  their futures unclear. The jewel in its second largest division  television  is ESPN  which in a sports-less world is now broadcasting athletes playing video games. The third group  studio  had expected to bring in most of its revenue from movie openings in theaters  which are now closed. There has been a glimmer of good news in the introduction of Disney+. The company’s troubled share price jumped about 7 percent in after-hours trading last Wednesday on the news that the streaming service had attracted 50 million subscribers. But the project is still an investment  years away from generating revenue that could replace a big movie opening in theaters. And the service is desperate for new content — at a time when television and film production has ground to a halt. This all means the company is losing as much as $30 million or more a day  the media industry analyst Hal Vogel estimated in an interview. The company borrowed $6 billion at the end of March  a sign both of its desperate plight and lenders’ confidence that it could rebound. In an emergency like this  Mr. Iger said  he had no choice but to abandon his plan to pull back. “A crisis of this magnitude  and its impact on Disney  would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it  particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!” he said in his email. That realization appears to have hit just after the company’s March 11 annual shareholder gathering in Raleigh  N.C.  which served as Mr. Chapek’s debut and was staged as a carefully scripted handoff. “I’ve watched Bob [Iger] lead this company to amazing new heights  and I’ve learned an enormous amount from that experience. I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to work closely with him during this transition ” Mr. Chapek said at the meeting. (A Disney spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Chapek available for an interview.) The men flew from there to Walt Disney World in Orlando  Fla.  to meet executives worried about the effect of social distancing on their business; they announced the park’s closing the next day. Then  they flew back to Los Angeles and on the way  said a person familiar with their conversation  they discussed the depth of the crisis. Mr. Iger made clear that he would remain closely involved. The next day  March 13  was their last in the office. In early April  Mr. Chapek sent a bleak internal email announcing a wave of furloughs. He pushed immediate cuts and freezes on everything from development budgets to contractors’ pay. The company employed 223 000 as of last summer  and won’t say how many workers are furloughed  but the numbers are huge. It includes more than 30 000 workers in the California resort business alone  according to the president of Workers United Local 50 that represents some of those workers  Chris Duarte. Another 43 000 workers in Florida will be furloughed  the company confirmed on Sunday. All the workers will keep their benefits  but their last paychecks come April 19. The mood at Disney is “dire ” said a person who has done projects with the company. “They’re covering the mirrors and ripping clothes.” Mr. Iger  meanwhile  is trying to figure out what the company will look like after the crisis. One central challenge is to establish best practices for the company and the industry on how to bring people back to the parks and rides while avoiding the virus’s spread — using measures like taking visitors’ temperatures. Mr. Iger also sees this as a moment  he has told associates  to look across the business and permanently change how it operates. He’s told them that he anticipates ending expensive old-school television practices like advertising upfronts and producing pilots for programs that may never air. Disney is also likely to reopen with less office space. He’s also told two people that he anticipated the company having fewer employees. (Mr. Iger said in an email on Sunday evening that he had “no recollection of ever having said” that he expected a smaller work force. “Regardless  any decision about staff reductions will be made by my successor and not me ” he added.) Mr. Iger’s own narrative had been written to a neat conclusion. Now  his legacy will probably be defined in the unexpected sequel of one of the great American companies fighting for its life. And Disney’s endlessly troublesome question of succession — which had finally  for a couple of weeks  seemed settled — may be open again. One person close to the company said Mr. Iger assured Mr. Chapek that the extraordinary circumstances would be taken into consideration in the board’s evaluation of Mr. Chapek’s performance. But in reality  two hard  unpredictable years will determine if he can hold the job. Two other executives who were passed over for Mr. Chapek — Kevin Mayer and Peter Rice — remain at the company. Nobody knows when Americans will go to the movies again  much less get on cruise ships. And nobody knows when — or whether — Mr. Iger will have another moment to leave on top.

Not Anymore, Female gymnasts born in 2005 will be eligible to compete at the 2021 Olympic Games. Plus it’s all in the family for Mets practicing at home  and horse racing continues in Nebraska., Supported by The day in (no) sports Female gymnasts born in 2005 will be eligible to compete at the 2021 Olympic Games. Plus it’s all in the family for Mets practicing at home  and horse racing continues in Nebraska. By Danielle Allentuck The International Gymnastics Federation announced on Thursday that female gymnasts born in 2005 will be eligible to compete at the Olympic Games in Tokyo — postponed to July 2021 — even though they would not have been allowed to if the Games were held this summer. That means some athletes who would have made the team if the Olympics were held as scheduled this summer  now may have their spot taken by a younger athlete. Konnor McClain  one of the top junior athletes  had her sights set on making the team in 2024. She will turn 16 next February  which now makes her eligible to compete for a spot on the U.S. team next summer. Her training plan had been designed to have her peak at just the right time for the 2024 Olympics. McClain said her coach had been cautious not to push her too early to try to prevent her from getting injured. She has been practicing more difficult skills  but was not planning on competing them yet. “I think it’s a little more scary because she’s been on a path where she had four years to do everything ” her mother Lorinda McClain said in a phone interview last month. “She’s on a great path. Her and her coach have a schedule going. It’s going to be a lot different for her and her coach.” Many in the gymnastics community do not like the new rules  including Cecile Landi  who coaches Simone Biles. “I have nothing against the 2005 generation  but I don’t agree with this decision ” Landi said in a tweet. “It will be the 2020 Olympics so the rules should remain the same as this year.” The federation also announced that there were no plans to move the 2021 World Championships  which are scheduled for Oct. 18-24  2021  in Denmark. On Thursday we told you what the Yankees were up to. Now let’s observe the equal-time rule. Mets’ catcher Wilson Ramos has a few new teammates: his children. His daughter and son got some practice off a tee on Thursday  with Ramos proudly watching behind them. Ramos also got a workout in  taking some swings and doing some catching. Infielder Wilmer Flores  a former Met  got an assist from family too  with his mother tossing him balls during his workout. With no access to fields  pitcher Marcus Stroman improvised and made his own bullpen on a dock. Last week  a barefoot Dominic Smith stood in as Stroman’s catcher as he practiced in a parking lot. The two also stayed competitive  participating in a virtual beer pong tournament. They aren’t the only Mets practicing together. Jeff McNeil and Brandon Nimmo have been working out together in Nimmo’s garage. McNeil has also been spending lots of time with his dog Willow  who he adopted at a Mets game last season. Horse racing is about the only American sport that is still underway. And a little track in Nebraska that railbirds mostly ignore in normal times is suddenly getting outsize attention. Fonner Park stopped racing on March 16 because of the coronavirus but started up again a week later  without fans. In March  betting on races at Fonner Park was up 272.2 percent over the previous year  even though there were 21 fewer races  according to figures compiled by Horse Racing Nation. The meet has been extended to April 29. “It exceeded our expectations because we did not expect as many other tracks to cancel racing ” Chris Kotulak  the track’s chief executive  told The Grand Island Independent. “So the limelight that we believed we were moving into just got a lot brighter than we expected.” Bettors nationwide are suddenly desperately interested in Nebraska racing. “We got a call from some guy in Ohio who wants to buy a Fonner Park T-shirt ” Kotulak said. The focus on Tuesday was on the Pick 5  which requires selecting the winners of five straight races. The total bet by players trying to hit that jackpot on Tuesday was $3.6 million  plus another $500 000 or so bet earlier. In the end  203 gamblers — in Nebraska  Ohio  New York  who knows? — picked five winners  earning $16 888.40 for a $1 bet. It’s a pretty sure thing that many of them have never been anywhere near Grand Island  Neb. But it wouldn’t be a day at the races without some disgruntled fans. In the first leg of the Pick 5 there was controversy  the horse racing site Paulick Report said. Finisher Where’s Rufus crossed the line first but was disqualified for interfering with the second-place finisher Taylor’s Prince  a decision that seemed to be marginal. This could not have pleased those who chose Where’s Rufus in the Pick 5  and then hit the next four winners  missing out on the jackpot. Even as the world changes  horseplayers stay the same. VICTOR MATHER While the pandemic has caused a steep economic blow to many sports leagues  no major ones have yet gone out of business. But there was disquieting news for fans of the XFL  the football league that launched this season and made it through five games before being stopped by the virus. At the time  it vowed to return in 2021  but on Friday the league decided to suspend its operations and lay off most employees. It was not immediately clear if the league would be back next season  but certainly the signs were ominous. An email to a communications executive at the company on Friday afternoon was returned as undeliverable.

No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/sports/10nosports1/10nosports1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/movies/shailene-woodley-endings-beginnings.html, movies, Shailene Woodley Finally Knows What She Wants Again, After experiencing blockbuster success and personal struggles  including a health scare  the “Endings  Beginnings” actress has found clarity., Supported by After experiencing blockbuster success and personal struggles  including a health scare  the “Endings  Beginnings” actress has found clarity. By Kyle Buchanan Shailene Woodley isn’t used to being at home. Since she began acting at 5 years old  she’s spent much of her life on set in TV shows (“The O.C.” and “The Secret Life of the American Teenager”)  movies (the “Divergent” franchise and “The Descendants”) and more recently  two seasons of the HBO hit “Big Little Lies ” in which she played the troubled single mother Jane. But now that the coronavirus has upended everything  the 28-year-old Woodley has sheltered at home for the last few weeks  social distancing with no company besides her dog. It’s the longest she’s lived in her own home since she was 17. And to be honest? She’s kind of loving it. “I’m an introvert’s introvert ” Woodley told me this week by phone  “so this feels like heaven in a lot of ways because I don’t have to talk to people  I don’t have to deal with people  I don’t even have to look at people. I can play the game of being an extrovert when I need to — it’s a big part of my job — but my happy place is honestly being alone.” Normally  Woodley would be gearing up for a press tour to promote her new film  “Endings  Beginnings ” but with theaters closed down  the movie will now debut April 17 on digital and on demand May 1. In the romantic drama  directed by Drake Doremus (“Like Crazy”)  Woodley plays Daphne  a young woman torn between dating two best friends: Jack (Jamie Dornan)  a nice guy offering stability and comfort  and Frank (Sebastian Stan)  who’s wilder  harder to pin down and better in bed. Much of the film is improvised  which posed a unique challenge for Woodley and her co-stars. “You understand the elements that create that particular person  and you create borders for that ” she said  “but the thing about a Drake Doremus movie is that you don’t really establish a character: You kind of go in as yourself.” She also spoke about her new outlook on her career and health problems in her early 20s. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. When you don’t know what lines are about to come out of your mouth  how does that change your relationship to who you’re playing? For me  when I’m building a character  I’m only experiencing different shades and colors of who I personally am. Daphne is one color of me that I got to explore  but I was speaking as Shailene  from a place within my own heart. I think she’s a little bit of my alter ego. How so? When I was 18  I moved into a cabin in the middle of the woods with no cellphone  no Wi-Fi. I’m a loner  and in Daphne  I got to explore some of the more extroverted side of myself who could go out and be free and live with abandon. It was fun to put myself in the position to think  “If I wasn’t worried about the consequences of taking all these drugs and staying at a bar in Silver Lake until 2 a.m.  what would that be like?” Because it’s just not something I would allow myself to do. How do you approach a love scene differently when there’s a level of improvisation to it? Luckily  our intimate scenes came toward the end of the shoot  so there was a great level of trust with the actors. In one scene  Sebastian picked me up and took me across the room as the camera followed us  and it was a completely different sex scene than what ended up in the movie. But we had to explore all different parts of these two people’s physical nature to really get down to the essence of what worked for this film thematically. Was there an intimacy coordinator? For me  intimacy coaches make me uncomfortable because it feels like another set of eyes that I don’t need. But I have no problem stopping production when I’m uncomfortable  and I don’t think that’s the case for a lot of people  so I think it’s wonderful that there’s a lifeline that people can lean on to know they’ll be protected. That being said  the best thing a director could do is ask an actor right off the bat: “What are you comfortable with? What are your boundaries?” There’s always a tension to cinematic love triangles where you wonder who the lead character will end up with  but while I was watching “Endings  Beginnings ” I did think to myself  “What would be so wrong with Daphne just continuing to see both men  if that’s something that they can make work?” Listen  I’m someone who has experienced both an open relationship and a deeply monogamous relationship in my life  and I think we’re in a day and age where there should be no rules except for the ones designed by two people in a partnership — or three people  whatever floats your boat! But there has to be a level of responsibility in any relationship dynamic  and that responsibility is simply honesty and communication and trust. Apart from that  it’s really none of our business what people choose to do with their lives. And this situation is not necessarily about Daphne trying to figure out which guy she likes more. It’s about them offering different versions of herself she could be  too. Absolutely. We’re societally conditioned to assume that one person can be our end-all  be-all. This is a concept I’ve been thinking about often right now  because I’m very much single [after being in a relationship for years with the rugby player Ben Volavola]  and I’ve chosen to be single for a while. The idea of being with someone … is it only because you’ve fallen in love with that person  or because there’s a newness to understanding yourself because of what that person can offer you? Daphne spends much of the movie trying to unpack her past. You’re 28 now  nearing the end of your 20s. When you think back to what you were like 10 years ago  how different were you? In my late teens  I had a strong idea of my identity and the meaning of my life  but then I went through an abusive relationship. That combined with  honestly  the commercial success I had in this industry began to wear on my strength. My 20s felt a little bit like being in a washing machine  where you’re being thrown all over the place. As a teenager and as a child  I always thought acting was a hobby  and I never wanted the idea of making it into a career to take away my passion for it. But in my 20s  there was a huge chunk of time where fear and anxiety and competition were definitely at the forefront of my mind and my ego in a way they weren’t when I was younger. Was that being whipped up by the industry  or were those things deep inside you and you had to learn to deal with them? I think it was probably a mixture of both. I haven’t spoken much about this yet publicly  and I will one day  but I was very  very sick in my early 20s. While I was doing the “Divergent” movies and working hard  I also was struggling with a deeply personal  very scary physical situation. Because of that  I said no to a lot of opportunities because I needed to get better  and those jobs ended up going to peers of mine who I love. They went on to a lot of success  but there was a mix of people saying  “You shouldn’t have let that go!” or “You shouldn’t have been sick!” That was combined with my own internal process of  “Am I going to survive what I’m going through right now and ever be healthy  or even have the opportunity to work on projects I’m passionate about again because of the situation I’m in?” I was in a place where I had no choice but to just surrender and let go of my career  and it brought out this negative voice in my mind that kept spinning for years and years afterward. And how are you feeling now? Now I’m on the other side of it  thank God. A lot of the last few years has been about focusing on mental health for me  and it’s a slow process. But because of that work  I feel very grounded and rooted in who I am and very clear about everything in my life  whether it’s my career or my relationships or my own internal worth. I feel very grateful to have walked that line of fire  because now I know what I don’t want to ever go back to.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/arts/music/bach-coronavirus.html, arts music, Bach in My Heart  and My Heart in His Hands, A consoling composer’s music reminds our critic of a surgeon who once helped him and is now on the front line of New York’s coronavirus crisis., Supported by critic’s notebook A consoling composer’s music reminds our critic of a surgeon who once helped him and is now on the front line of New York’s coronavirus crisis. By James R. Oestreich When the physician and writer Lewis Thomas died  in 1993  his New York Times obituary called him “the poet-philosopher of medicine.” And of science in general  it might have added. In one essay  he wrote about a prospective attempt at contact with whatever living creatures might inhabit interstellar reaches. What should we try to communicate? “I would vote for Bach ” Thomas wrote  “all of Bach  streamed out into space  over and over again. We would be bragging  of course  but it is surely excusable for us to put the best possible face on at the beginning of such an acquaintance. We can tell the harder truths later.” I would vote for Bach  too — especially at this time of hard truths. His music  like that of others but more than most  can edify  elevate and inspire in its intelligence  its endless inventiveness and its understated emotion. And in its very intimacy  his music can pack a tremendous visceral punch. Bach — the least socially distanced of composers in his domestic life  with 20 children passing through at one time or another — wrote a lot of music that is ideal for social distancing  most notably his many solo works for violin  cello or keyboard. During Music Never Sleeps NYC  a wonderful recent 24-hour live-streamed event  Bach after Bach emerged from the instruments of the artists transmitting from their apartments. Before playing the Chaconne from the Unaccompanied Violin Partita No. 2  Jennifer Koh spoke of the solace this music can offer in a troubled time. The violinist Midori conveyed much the same sentiment without words in a complete performance of the Partita No. 1. The Knights  a chamber orchestra  contributed a remarkable performance of the “Brandenburg” Concerto No. 3 filmed at Caramoor last fall. In place of the slow movement that Bach never wrote  it included an arrangement of Paul Simon’s “American Tune” (itself based on Bach’s Passion chorale)  movingly sung by Christina Courtin. This all came as blessed relief  solace indeed. But there was also an uncomfortable edge. For  I often had to wonder  who am I to be privileged to wallow in Bach when so many people are suffering and dying of the virus? Who am I to be so gloriously entertained while doctors  nurses and hospital supply  maintenance and cleaning people are laboring as never before in unrelentingly terrifying conditions? I thought of a medical poet-philosopher of our own moment  Craig R. Smith  the surgeon-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. He writes daily updates about the coronavirus crisis to the hospital staff  which have attracted a following on the internet for their depth  candor  gentle and tough encouragement  cleareyed compassion and literary quality. Unlike Lewis Thomas  who generally reflected from a serene height above the fray  Dr. Smith is writing in the horrifying grip of the here and now  of ventilators and personal protective equipment. “Today ” he noted last month  “I don’t want my parables and literary flourishes to get in the way of the redeployment punchline  which is this: We will not leave you alone out there!” “We will keep pumping out people ” he added  “as long as we have people to pump.” And his literary flourishes  when they come  are apt. Writing late in the day on April 1  Dr. Smith quoted the classic opening lines of T.S. Eliot’s “The Wasteland”: “April is the cruelest month  breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land  mixing / Memory and desire  stirring / Dull roots with spring rain.” Then he added: “In an April that may be apocalyptically cruel  that is how we are poised  desiring spring.” It is easy enough to salute embattled health care workers in the abstract. But for me  Dr. Smith puts a personal  human face on the matter  making issues of gratitude and respect even more poignant. I already knew him  from what seems an earlier world. Ten years ago  Dr. Smith performed open-heart surgery to replace my congenitally malformed aortic valve  which had led to years of worsening arrhythmia. Though typically booked solid with two surgeries a day  he kindly visited my room just before the operation for what must have seemed to him an absurd consultation: to reassure a nervous music critic that the mechanical valve he was about to install would not audibly click or clank during concerts at Carnegie Hall. Open-heart surgery  I have learned  does funny (and not so funny) things to your emotional makeup. For one  I immediately developed deep-seated  squirreling obsessions: How  for instance  could you possibly thank someone who had actually handled your heart and fixed it? You can’t  not adequately. But I gave Dr. Smith a CD copy of Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion” and fumblingly tried to explain that this music was one of my main reasons for wanting to live longer  and that I hoped that he might share some of the same feeling. Now  once again  I hope that Dr. Smith and his valiant colleagues might eventually find through music the solace and  yes  joy that some of us have already been privileged to salvage from this dreadful time. May Bach and his composing and performing colleagues help us all on what promises to be a long road to recovery.

By Eric Lipton  David E. Sanger  Maggie Haberman  Michael D. Shear  Mark Mazzetti and Julian E. Barnes To hear more audio stories from publishers  like The New York Times  download Audm for iPhone or Android.  WASHINGTON — “Any way you cut it  this is going to be bad ” a senior medical adviser at the Department of Veterans Affairs  Dr. Carter Mecher  wrote on the night of Jan. 28  in an email to a group of public health experts scattered around the government and universities. “The projected size of the outbreak already seems hard to believe.” A week after the first coronavirus case had been identified in the United States  and six long weeks before President Trump finally took aggressive action to confront the danger the nation was facing — a pandemic that is now forecast to take tens of thousands of American lives — Dr. Mecher was urging the upper ranks of the nation’s public health bureaucracy to wake up and prepare for the possibility of far more drastic action. “You guys made fun of me screaming to close the schools ” he wrote to the group  which called itself “Red Dawn ” an inside joke based on the 1984 movie about a band of Americans trying to save the country after a foreign invasion. “Now I’m screaming  close the colleges and universities.” His was hardly a lone voice. Throughout January  as Mr. Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues  an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat  sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action. The president  though  was slow to absorb the scale of the risk and to act accordingly  focusing instead on controlling the message  protecting gains in the economy and batting away warnings from senior officials. It was a problem  he said  that had come out of nowhere and could not have been foreseen. Even after Mr. Trump took his first concrete action at the end of January — limiting travel from China — public health often had to compete with economic and political considerations in internal debates  slowing the path toward belated decisions to seek more money from Congress  obtain necessary supplies  address shortfalls in testing and ultimately move to keep much of the nation at home. Unfolding as it did in the wake of his impeachment by the House and in the midst of his Senate trial  Mr. Trump’s response was colored by his suspicion of and disdain for what he viewed as the “Deep State” — the very people in his government whose expertise and long experience might have guided him more quickly toward steps that would slow the virus  and likely save lives. Decision-making was also complicated by a long-running dispute inside the administration over how to deal with China. The virus at first took a back seat to a desire not to upset Beijing during trade talks  but later the impulse to score points against Beijing left the world’s two leading powers further divided as they confronted one of the first truly global threats of the 21st century. The shortcomings of Mr. Trump’s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation. But dozens of interviews with current and former officials and a review of emails and other records revealed many previously unreported details and a fuller picture of the roots and extent of his halting response as the deadly virus spread: The National Security Council office responsible for tracking pandemics received intelligence reports in early January predicting the spread of the virus to the United States  and within weeks was raising options like keeping Americans home from work and shutting down cities the size of Chicago. Mr. Trump would avoid such steps until March. Despite Mr. Trump’s denial weeks later  he was told at the time about a Jan. 29 memo produced by his trade adviser  Peter Navarro  laying out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses. The health and human services secretary  Alex M. Azar II  directly warned Mr. Trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call on Jan. 30  the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks. The president  who was on Air Force One while traveling for appearances in the Midwest  responded that Mr. Azar was being alarmist. Mr. Azar publicly announced in February that the government was establishing a “surveillance” system in five American cities to measure the spread of the virus and enable experts to project the next hot spots. It was delayed for weeks. The slow start of that plan  on top of the well-documented failures to develop the nation’s testing capacity  left administration officials with almost no insight into how rapidly the virus was spreading. “We were flying the plane with no instruments ” one official said. By the third week in February  the administration’s top public health experts concluded they should recommend to Mr. Trump a new approach that would include warning the American people of the risks and urging steps like social distancing and staying home from work. But the White House focused instead on messaging and crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president — time when the virus spread largely unimpeded. When Mr. Trump finally agreed in mid-March to recommend social distancing across the country  effectively bringing much of the economy to a halt  he seemed shellshocked and deflated to some of his closest associates. One described him as “subdued” and “baffled” by how the crisis had played out. An economy that he had wagered his re-election on was suddenly in shambles. He only regained his swagger  the associate said  from conducting his daily White House briefings  at which he often seeks to rewrite the history of the past several months. He declared at one point that he “felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic ” and insisted at another that he had to be a “cheerleader for the country ” as if that explained why he failed to prepare the public for what was coming. Mr. Trump’s allies and some administration officials say the criticism has been unfair. The Chinese government misled other governments  they say. And they insist that the president was either not getting proper information  or the people around him weren’t conveying the urgency of the threat. In some cases  they argue  the specific officials he was hearing from had been discredited in his eyes  but once the right information got to him through other channels  he made the right calls. “While the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February  President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus  expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development even when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread ” said Judd Deere  a White House spokesman. There were key turning points along the way  opportunities for Mr. Trump to get ahead of the virus rather than just chase it. There were internal debates that presented him with stark choices  and moments when he could have chosen to ask deeper questions and learn more. How he handled them may shape his re-election campaign. They will certainly shape his legacy. By the last week of February  it was clear to the administration’s public health team that schools and businesses in hot spots would have to close. But in the turbulence of the Trump White House  it took three more weeks to persuade the president that failure to act quickly to control the spread of the virus would have dire consequences. When Dr. Robert Kadlec  the top disaster response official at the Health and Human Services Department  convened the White House coronavirus task force on Feb. 21  his agenda was urgent. There were deep cracks in the administration’s strategy for keeping the virus out of the United States. They were going to have to lock down the country to prevent it from spreading. The question was: When? There had already been an alarming spike in new cases around the world and the virus was spreading across the Middle East. It was becoming apparent that the administration had botched the rollout of testing to track the virus at home  and a smaller-scale surveillance program intended to piggyback on a federal flu tracking system had also been stillborn. In Washington  the president was not worried  predicting that by April  “when it gets a little warmer  it miraculously goes away.” His White House had yet to ask Congress for additional funding to prepare for the potential cost of wide-scale infection across the country  and health care providers were growing increasingly nervous about the availability of masks  ventilators and other equipment. What Mr. Trump decided to do next could dramatically shape the course of the pandemic — and how many people would get sick and die. With that in mind  the task force had gathered for a tabletop exercise — a real-time version of a full-scale war gaming of a flu pandemic the administration had run the previous year. That earlier exercise  also conducted by Mr. Kadlec and called “Crimson Contagion ” predicted 110 million infections  7.7 million hospitalizations and 586 000 deaths following a hypothetical outbreak that started in China. Facing the likelihood of a real pandemic  the group needed to decide when to abandon “containment” — the effort to keep the virus outside the U.S. and to isolate anyone who gets infected — and embrace “mitigation” to thwart the spread of the virus inside the country until a vaccine becomes available. Among the questions on the agenda  which was reviewed by The New York Times  was when the department’s secretary  Mr. Azar  should recommend that Mr. Trump take textbook mitigation measures “such as school dismissals and cancellations of mass gatherings ” which had been identified as the next appropriate step in a Bush-era pandemic plan. The exercise was sobering. The group — including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health; Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and Mr. Azar  who at that stage was leading the White House Task Force — concluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing  even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation’s economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans. If Dr. Kadlec had any doubts  they were erased two days later  when he stumbled upon an email from a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology  who was among the group of academics  government physicians and infectious diseases doctors who had spent weeks tracking the outbreak in the Red Dawn email chain. A 20-year-old Chinese woman had infected five relatives with the virus even though she never displayed any symptoms herself. The implication was grave — apparently healthy people could be unknowingly spreading the virus — and supported the need to move quickly to mitigation. “Is this true?!” Dr. Kadlec wrote back to the researcher. “If so we have a huge whole on our screening and quarantine effort ” including a typo where he meant hole. Her response was blunt: “People are carrying the virus everywhere.” The following day  Dr. Kadlec and the others decided to present Mr. Trump with a plan titled “Four Steps to Mitigation ” telling the president that they needed to begin preparing Americans for a step rarely taken in United States history. But over the next several days  a presidential blowup and internal turf fights would sidetrack such a move. The focus would shift to messaging and confident predictions of success rather than publicly calling for a shift to mitigation. These final days of February  perhaps more than any other moment during his tenure in the White House  illustrated Mr. Trump’s inability or unwillingness to absorb warnings coming at him. He instead reverted to his traditional political playbook in the midst of a public health calamity  squandering vital time as the coronavirus spread silently across the country. Dr. Kadlec’s group wanted to meet with the president right away  but Mr. Trump was on a trip to India  so they agreed to make the case to him in person as soon as he returned two days later. If they could convince him of the need to shift strategy  they could immediately begin a national education campaign aimed at preparing the public for the new reality. A memo dated Feb. 14  prepared in coordination with the National Security Council and titled “U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ” documented what more drastic measures would look like  including: “significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events  performances  and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures. Widespread ‘stay at home’ directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.” The memo did not advocate an immediate national shutdown  but said the targeted use of “quarantine and isolation measures” could be used to slow the spread in places where “sustained human-to-human transmission” is evident. Within 24 hours  before they got a chance to make their presentation to the president  the plan went awry. Mr. Trump was walking up the steps of Air Force One to head home from India on Feb. 25 when Dr. Nancy Messonnier  the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases  publicly issued the blunt warning they had all agreed was necessary. But Dr. Messonnier had jumped the gun. They had not told the president yet  much less gotten his consent. On the 18-hour plane ride home  Mr. Trump fumed as he watched the stock market crash after Dr. Messonnier’s comments. Furious  he called Mr. Azar when he landed at around 6 a.m. on Feb. 26  raging that Dr. Messonnier had scared people unnecessarily. Already on thin ice with the president over a variety of issues and having overseen the failure to quickly produce an effective and widely available test  Mr. Azar would soon find his authority reduced. The meeting that evening with Mr. Trump to advocate social distancing was canceled  replaced by a news conference in which the president announced that the White House response would be put under the command of Vice President Mike Pence. The push to convince Mr. Trump of the need for more assertive action stalled. With Mr. Pence and his staff in charge  the focus was clear: no more alarmist messages. Statements and media appearances by health officials like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield would be coordinated through Mr. Pence’s office. It would be more than three weeks before Mr. Trump would announce serious social distancing efforts  a lost period during which the spread of the virus accelerated rapidly. Over nearly three weeks from Feb. 26 to March 16  the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States grew from 15 to 4 226. Since then  nearly half a million Americans have tested positive for the virus and authorities say hundreds of thousands more are likely infected. The earliest warnings about coronavirus got caught in the crosscurrents of the administration’s internal disputes over China. It was the China hawks who pushed earliest for a travel ban. But their animosity toward China also undercut hopes for a more cooperative approach by the world’s two leading powers to a global crisis. It was early January  and the call with a Hong Kong epidemiologist left Matthew Pottinger rattled. Mr. Pottinger  the deputy national security adviser and a hawk on China  took a blunt warning away from the call with the doctor  a longtime friend: A ferocious  new outbreak that on the surface appeared similar to the SARS epidemic of 2003 had emerged in China. It had spread far more quickly than the government was admitting to  and it wouldn’t be long before it reached other parts of the world. Mr. Pottinger had worked as a Wall Street Journal correspondent in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic  and was still scarred by his experience documenting the death spread by that highly contagious virus. Now  seventeen years later  his friend had a blunt message: You need to be ready. The virus  he warned  which originated in the city of Wuhan  was being transmitted by people who were showing no symptoms — an insight that American health officials had not yet accepted. Mr. Pottinger declined through a spokesman to comment. It was one of the earliest warnings to the White House  and it echoed the intelligence reports making their way to the National Security Council. While most of the early assessments from the C.I.A. had little more information than was available publicly  some of the more specialized corners of the intelligence world were producing sophisticated and chilling warnings. In a report to the director of national intelligence  the State Department’s epidemiologist wrote in early January that the virus was likely to spread across the globe  and warned that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic. Working independently  a small outpost of the Defense Intelligence Agency  the National Center for Medical Intelligence  came to the same conclusion. Within weeks after getting initial information about the virus early in the year  biodefense experts inside the National Security Council  looking at what was happening in Wuhan  started urging officials to think about what would be needed to quarantine a city the size of Chicago. By mid-January there was growing evidence of the virus spreading outside China. Mr. Pottinger began convening daily meetings about the coronavirus. He alerted his boss  Robert C. O’Brien  the national security adviser. The early alarms sounded by Mr. Pottinger and other China hawks were freighted with ideology — including a push to publicly blame China that critics in the administration say was a distraction as the coronavirus spread to Western Europe and eventually the United States. And they ran into opposition from Mr. Trump’s economic advisers  who worried a tough approach toward China could scuttle a trade deal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. With his skeptical — some might even say conspiratorial — view of China’s ruling Communist Party  Mr. Pottinger initially suspected that President Xi Jinping’s government was keeping a dark secret: that the virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens. In his view  it might have even been a deadly accident unleashed on an unsuspecting Chinese population. During meetings and telephone calls  Mr. Pottinger asked intelligence agencies — including officers at the C.I.A. working on Asia and on weapons of mass destruction — to search for evidence that might bolster his theory. They didn’t have any evidence. Intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the Chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory. But Mr. Pottinger continued to believe the coronavirus problem was far worse than the Chinese were acknowledging. Inside the West Wing  the director of the Domestic Policy Council  Joe Grogan  also tried to sound alarms that the threat from China was growing. Mr. Pottinger  backed by Mr. O’Brien  became one of the driving forces of a campaign in the final weeks of January to convince Mr. Trump to impose limits on travel from China — the first substantive step taken to impede the spread of the virus and one that the president has repeatedly cited as evidence that he was on top of the problem. In addition to the opposition from the economic team  Mr. Pottinger and his allies among the China hawks had to overcome initial skepticism from the administration’s public health experts. Travel restrictions were usually counterproductive to managing biological outbreaks because they prevented doctors and other much-needed medical help from easily getting to the affected areas  the health officials said. And such bans often cause infected people to flee  spreading the disease further. But on the morning of Jan. 30  Mr. Azar got a call from Dr. Fauci  Dr. Redfield and others saying they had changed their minds. The World Health Organization had declared a global public health emergency and American officials had discovered the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission inside the United States. The economic team  led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  continued to argue that there were big risks in taking a provocative step toward China and moving to curb global travel. After a debate  Mr. Trump came down on the side of the hawks and the public health team. The limits on travel from China were publicly announced on Jan. 31. Still  Mr. Trump and other senior officials were wary of further upsetting Beijing. Besides the concerns about the impact on the trade deal  they knew that an escalating confrontation was risky because the United States relies heavily on China for pharmaceuticals and the kinds of protective equipment most needed to combat the coronavirus. But the hawks kept pushing in February to take a critical stance toward China amid the growing crisis. Mr. Pottinger and others — including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — pressed for government statements to use the term “Wuhan Virus.” Mr. Pompeo tried to hammer the anti-China message at every turn  eventually even urging leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized countries to use “Wuhan virus” in a joint statement. Others  including aides to Mr. Pence  resisted taking a hard public line  believing that angering Beijing might lead the Chinese government to withhold medical supplies  pharmaceuticals and any scientific research that might ultimately lead to a vaccine. Mr. Trump took a conciliatory approach through the middle of March  praising the job Mr. Xi was doing. That changed abruptly  when aides informed Mr. Trump that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had publicly spun a new conspiracy about the origins of Covid-19: that it was brought to China by U.S. Army personnel who visited the country last October. Mr. Trump was furious  and he took to his favorite platform to broadcast a new message. On March 16  he wrote on Twitter that “the United States will be powerfully supporting those industries  like Airlines and others  that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.” Mr. Trump’s decision to escalate the war of words undercut any remaining possibility of broad cooperation between the governments to address a global threat. It remains to be seen whether that mutual suspicion will spill over into efforts to develop treatments or vaccines  both areas where the two nations are now competing. One immediate result was a free-for-all across the United States  with state and local governments and hospitals bidding on the open market for scarce but essential Chinese-made products. When the state of Massachusetts managed to procure 1.2 million masks  it fell to the owner of the New England Patriots  Robert K. Kraft  a Trump ally  to cut through extensive red tape on both sides of the Pacific to send his own plane to pick them up. The chaotic culture of the Trump White House contributed to the crisis. A lack of planning and a failure to execute  combined with the president’s focus on the news cycle and his preference for following his gut rather than the data cost time  and perhaps lives. Inside the West Wing  Mr. Navarro  Mr. Trump’s trade adviser  was widely seen as quick-tempered  self-important and prone to butting in. He is among the most outspoken of China hawks and in late January was clashing with the administration’s health experts over limiting travel from China. So it elicited eye rolls when  after initially being prevented from joining the coronavirus task force  he circulated a memo on Jan. 29 urging Mr. Trump to impose the travel limits  arguing that failing to confront the outbreak aggressively could be catastrophic  leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses. The uninvited message could not have conflicted more with the president’s approach at the time of playing down the severity of the threat. And when aides raised it with Mr. Trump  he responded that he was unhappy that Mr. Navarro had put his warning in writing. From the time the virus was first identified as a concern  the administration’s response was plagued by the rivalries and factionalism that routinely swirl around Mr. Trump and  along with the president’s impulsiveness  undercut decision making and policy development. Faced with the relentless march of a deadly pathogen  the disagreements and a lack of long-term planning had significant consequences. They slowed the president’s response and resulted in problems with execution and planning  including delays in seeking money from Capitol Hill and a failure to begin broad surveillance testing. The efforts to shape Mr. Trump’s view of the virus began early in January  when his focus was elsewhere: the fallout from his decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani  Iran’s security mastermind; his push for an initial trade deal with China; and his Senate impeachment trial  which was about to begin. Even after Mr. Azar first briefed him about the potential seriousness of the virus during a phone call on Jan. 18 while the president was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida  Mr. Trump projected confidence that it would be a passing problem. “We have it totally under control ” he told an interviewer a few days later while attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. “It’s going to be just fine.” Back in Washington  voices outside of the White House peppered Mr. Trump with competing assessments about what he should do and how quickly he should act. The efforts to sort out policy behind closed doors were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized. That was the case when the National Security Council convened a meeting on short notice on the afternoon of Jan. 27. The Situation Room was standing room only  packed with top White House advisers  low-level staffers  Mr. Trump’s social media guru  and several cabinet secretaries. There was no checklist about the preparations for a possible pandemic  which would require intensive testing  rapid acquisition of protective gear  and perhaps serious limitations on Americans’ movements. Instead  after a 20-minute description by Mr. Azar of his department’s capabilities  the meeting was jolted when Stephen E. Biegun  the newly installed deputy secretary of state  announced plans to issue a “level four” travel warning  strongly discouraging Americans from traveling to China. The room erupted into bickering. A few days later  on the evening of Jan. 30  Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff at the time  and Mr. Azar called Air Force One as the president was making the final decision to go ahead with the restrictions on China travel. Mr. Azar was blunt  warning that the virus could develop into a pandemic and arguing that China should be criticized for failing to be transparent. Mr. Trump rejected the idea of criticizing China  saying the country had enough to deal with. And if the president’s decision on the travel restrictions suggested that he fully grasped the seriousness of the situation  his response to Mr. Azar indicated otherwise. Stop panicking  Mr. Trump told him. That sentiment was present throughout February  as the president’s top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis. During a briefing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 5  senators urged administration officials to take the threat more seriously. Several asked if the administration needed additional money to help local and state health departments prepare. Derek Kan  a senior official from the Office of Management and Budget  replied that the administration had all the money it needed  at least at that point  to stop the virus  two senators who attended the briefing said. “Just left the Administration briefing on Coronavirus ” Senator Christopher S. Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  wrote in a tweet shortly after. “Bottom line: they aren’t taking this seriously enough.” The administration also struggled to carry out plans it did agree on. In mid-February  with the effort to roll out widespread testing stalled  Mr. Azar announced a plan to repurpose a flu-surveillance system in five major cities to help track the virus among the general population. The effort all but collapsed even before it got started as Mr. Azar struggled to win approval for $100 million in funding and the C.D.C. failed to make reliable tests available. The number of infections in the United States started to surge through February and early March  but the Trump administration did not move to place large-scale orders for masks and other protective equipment  or critical hospital equipment  such as ventilators. The Pentagon sat on standby  awaiting any orders to help provide temporary hospitals or other assistance. As February gave way to March  the president continued to be surrounded by divided factions even as it became clearer that avoiding more aggressive steps was not tenable. Mr. Trump had agreed to give an Oval Office address on the evening of March 11 announcing restrictions on travel from Europe  where the virus was ravaging Italy. But responding to the views of his business friends and others  he continued to resist calls for social distancing  school closures and other steps that would imperil the economy. But the virus was already multiplying across the country — and hospitals were at risk of buckling under the looming wave of severely ill people  lacking masks and other protective equipment  ventilators and sufficient intensive care beds. The question loomed over the president and his aides after weeks of stalling and inaction: What were they going to do? The approach that Mr. Azar and others had planned to bring to him weeks earlier moved to the top of the agenda. Even then  and even by Trump White House standards  the debate over whether to shut down much of the country to slow the spread was especially fierce. Always attuned to anything that could trigger a stock market decline or an economic slowdown that could hamper his re-election effort  Mr. Trump also reached out to prominent investors like Stephen A. Schwarzman  the chief executive of Blackstone Group  a private equity firm. “Everybody questioned it for a while  not everybody  but a good portion questioned it ” Mr. Trump said earlier this month. “They said  let’s keep it open. Let’s ride it.” In a tense Oval Office meeting  when Mr. Mnuchin again stressed that the economy would be ravaged  Mr. O’Brien  the national security adviser  who had been worried about the virus for weeks  sounded exasperated as he told Mr. Mnuchin that the economy would be destroyed regardless if officials did nothing. Soon after the Oval Office address  Dr. Scott Gottlieb  the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a trusted sounding board inside the White House  visited Mr. Trump  partly at the urging of Jared Kushner  the president’s son-in-law. Dr. Gottlieb’s role was to impress upon the president how serious the crisis could become. Mr. Pence  by then in charge of the task force  also played a key role at that point in getting through to the president about the seriousness of the moment in a way that Mr. Azar had not. But in the end  aides said  it was Dr. Deborah L. Birx  the veteran AIDS researcher who had joined the task force  who helped to persuade Mr. Trump. Soft-spoken and fond of the kind of charts and graphs Mr. Trump prefers  Dr. Birx did not have the rough edges that could irritate the president. He often told people he thought she was elegant. On Monday  March 16  Mr. Trump announced new social distancing guidelines  saying they would be in place for two weeks. The subsequent economic disruptions were so severe that the president repeatedly suggested that he wanted to lift even those temporary restrictions. He frequently asked aides why his administration was still being blamed in news coverage for the widespread failures involving testing  insisting the responsibility had shifted to the states. During the last week in March  Kellyanne Conway  a senior White House adviser involved in task force meetings  gave voice to concerns other aides had. She warned Mr. Trump that his wished-for date of Easter to reopen the country likely couldn’t be accomplished. Among other things  she told him  he would end up being blamed by critics for every subsequent death caused by the virus. Within days  he watched images on television of a calamitous situation at Elmhurst Hospital Center  miles from his childhood home in Queens  N.Y.  where 13 people had died from the coronavirus in 24 hours. He left the restrictions in place. Mark Walker contributed reporting from Washington  and Mike Baker from Seattle. Kitty Bennett contributed research. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/us/politics/12dc-virus-reconstruct1/12dc-virus-reconstruct1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/multimedia/author-eric-lipton/author-eric-lipton-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/multimedia/author-david-e-sanger/author-david-e-sanger-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-michael-d-shear/author-michael-d-shear-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-Mark-Mazzetti/author-Mark-Mazzetti-thumbLarge-v4.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-julian-barnes/author-julian-barnes-thumbLarge.png 
11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/nyregion/nursing-homes-deaths-coronavirus.html, nyregion, Nearly 2 000 Dead as Coronavirus Ravages Nursing Homes in N.Y. Region, The facilities knew that frail and aging residents were especially vulnerable to the outbreak  but they were unable to stop it., Supported by The facilities knew that frail and aging residents were especially vulnerable to the outbreak  but they were unable to stop it. By Amy Julia Harris  John Leland and Tracey Tully At Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Brooklyn  workers said they had to convert a room into a makeshift morgue after more than 15 residents died of the coronavirus  and funeral homes could not handle all the bodies. At Elizabeth Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in New Jersey  19 deaths have been linked to the virus; of the 54 residents who remain  44 are sick. After 13 people died in an outbreak at the New Jersey Veterans Home in Paramus  the governor called in 40 combat medics from the National Guard. In Manhattan  two women who met during visits to the Upper East Side Rehabilitation and Nursing Center felt helpless while their mothers died of the virus within minutes of each other. Both had been unable to see their mothers for weeks. “The last day I went there  I told a supervisor  ‘I’m thinking of taking my mother out before something terrible happens ’” one of the women  Lynda Walsh-Clifford  said. “He said  ‘Don’t worry  everything will be fine.’” In New York  the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak  the virus has snatched lives in every part of society  the daily death toll near 800 for a third straight day on Friday in what officials hoped would be a peak. Overall  8 627 deaths in New York had been attributed to Covid-19 by Saturday  and the total for New York  New Jersey and Connecticut was over 10 000. The virus has perhaps been cruelest at nursing homes and other facilities for older people  where a combination of factors — an aging or frail population  chronic understaffing  shortages of protective gear and constant physical contact between workers and residents — has hastened its spread. In all  nearly 2 000 residents of nursing homes have died in the outbreak in the region  and thousands of other residents are sick. As of Friday  more than half of New York’s 613 licensed nursing homes had reported coronavirus infections  with 4 630 total positive cases and 1 439 deaths  officials said. In New Jersey  nursing homes had been linked to 252 virus-related deaths  more than 90 of them in the past two days. The outbreak has now affected at least 70 percent of the state’s long-term care centers. The actual infection rate in nursing homes is almost certainly higher than the data indicate because few homes have the capacity to test residents. The assumption among many in the industry is that every nursing home in the region has people with Covid-19. The crisis in nursing homes is occurring in virus hot spots across the country  with infections growing in places like Rhode Island  Pennsylvania and North Carolina. In New York  nursing home administrators said they had been overwhelmed by an outbreak that quickly spun beyond their control. They were unable  they said  to have residents tested to isolate the virus or to get protective equipment to keep workers from getting sick or transmitting the virus to residents. “The story is not about whether there’s Covid-19 in the nursing homes ” said Scott LaRue  the chief executive of ArchCare  which operates five nursing homes in New York. “The story is  why aren’t they being treated with the same respect and the same resources that everyone else out there is? It’s ridiculous.” Advocates for nursing home residents in the New York region lashed out at the homes’ owners  saying they were negligent and had hastened the crisis by cutting staff to a minimum. “The residents are sitting ducks ” said Richard Mollot  the executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition. Andrew M. Cuomo  New York’s governor  said last month that the pandemic was difficult to stop. “Coronavirus in a nursing home can be like fire through dry grass ” he said. New York State health officials defended their oversight of nursing homes  saying they had adopted a raft of regulations in recent weeks to protect residents. The regulations barred visitors from homes and ceased all group meals and activities — difficult choices because loneliness is its own plague in nursing homes — and required that every worker be tested for fever or respiratory symptoms at every shift. Gary Holmes  a state Health Department spokesman  said  “We’ve said from the start that protecting our most vulnerable populations including people in nursing homes is our top priority  and that’s why the state acted quickly and aggressively to issue guidance specifically for these facilities on testing  infection control  environmental cleaning  staffing  visitation  admission  readmission  and outreach to residents and families.” New Jersey’s health commissioner said the state had moved quickly to house sick people in separate hallways or wings  and to address outbreaks by enforcing strict protocols. Late last month  an entire nursing home was evacuated and 94 residents were relocated to a facility a half-hour away after dozens of residents and staff members tested positive for the virus. New Jersey officials are planning to move more residents out of some facilities and into new ones to create a firewall between those who are infected  and those who are not. “Situations like this show pretty clearly the vulnerability of our systems of care ” Dawn Thomas  a spokeswoman for the Health Department  said on Friday. When the coronavirus broke out in a nursing home in Kirkland  Wash.  in late February  killing at least 35 people  nursing homes and state health officials in New York and New Jersey recalled that they knew it would soon arrive. Yet they were not prepared for the scale of the crisis. “It seems like an eternity ago ” said Jeffrey Farber  the chief executive of the New Jewish Home  which has homes in Manhattan and Westchester County. “We were following the news  hearing about China. It was  ‘We’ve dealt with epidemics before  we know how to care for people who have respiratory diseases.’” Members of Dr. Farber’s staff consulted suppliers of protective equipment  like masks and gowns  to make sure they could deliver the usual quantities by the time the virus arrived. They assured him they could. Dr. Farber declined to say how many residents had died of the virus  but both New Jewish Home facilities added refrigerator trucks to act as morgues because funeral homes were overburdened. The response from nursing homes and government agencies has been a patchwork  with some homes barring visitors before states acted. In New York  relatives were prohibited from visiting homes beginning March 13. Similar restrictions took effect in New Jersey on March 14. As a result  families were unable to get information about how residents were faring. “No one knows anything ” said Paul Bunten  who had two close friends die in nursing homes in Manhattan and the Bronx. “They don’t tell us anything. My head is sort of spinning.” Nursing homes were already understaffed. Now workers were calling in sick or were themselves quarantined — all as the workload was increasing  with more sick patients  more need for sanitizing  more individual delivery of meals and medications. “We’re all infected already ” Margaret Boyce  a certified nursing assistant at JFK Hartwyck at Edison Estates in New Jersey  remembered a supervisor telling her. In New York City  the virus was confirmed at a nursing home as early as March 8  when a worker at King David Nursing Home in Brooklyn tested positive. The home isolated the worker and tested the eight residents he had come in contact with. All tests were negative. But the virus spread  and King David now has confirmed cases  said a spokesman for Allure Group  which owns King David and Crown Heights. Crown Heights is the Brooklyn nursing home that had to create a makeshift morgue because of the rising number of deaths. “They had to convert another area to temporarily hold bodies of the deceased in a humane and safe way ” the home’s management said in a statement. As the virus spread  some nursing homes went into denial  not wanting to alarm residents or their families. Some instructed workers not to wear protective gowns or masks for the same reasons. Staff members at Alaris Health at Hamilton Park  a 260-bed home in Jersey City  said they were instructed to tell family members that while a patient there had tested positive for Covid-19  there was no cause for alarm. “Everything is fine ” the script read  according to a handout obtained by The New York Times. “We are closely monitoring all residents and staff of any signs of illness….” But inside the home  it was chaos. Workers said they moved from patient to patient without adequate protective equipment. Some workers were hospitalized  said LaDawn Chapman  a certified nursing assistant. “It’s so many deaths ” Ms. Chapman said. “We’re losing people left and right.” Staff members said that so many workers had fallen ill supervisors were imploring them to come to work even if they were sick  according to copies of text messages reviewed by The Times. “You had it for weeks already  what does it matter if you work 2 more days ” one supervisor texted a sick worker  according to messages reviewed by The Times. More residents developed fevers and hacking coughs  and the home did not isolate everyone with symptoms  workers said. One complained that healthy residents were being infected by coughing roommates  and “you have two people dying instead of one.” Robert Chinery Jr. said he was horrified when he was FaceTiming with his 80-year-old father  Robert Chinery Sr.  last week and saw that the caregiver holding the phone was only protected by a paper mask. “You’re bringing it from one patient to the next ” Mr. Chinery said. “They basically exposed him.” Mr. Chinery said his father developed a fever and was taken to the hospital. But a doctor discharged him  saying he would be safer in the nursing home. There he began to have trouble breathing and then deteriorated rapidly. On April 7  Mr. Chinery got a call telling him his father had died. Fifteen minutes later  a staff member called back  asking what to do with the body. “He should not be dead ” Mr. Chinery said. “It was preventable.” The same day  the Jersey City health department took the rare step of issuing an administrative order telling Alaris to sequester coronavirus patients on one floor  and to provide staff members with proper protective gear  according to a copy of the health order. For many  it was too late. At least 11 residents and two staff members have died  according to city health officials and interviews with workers. As of Thursday  17 residents had tested positive for the virus  five of whom were hospitalized  according to the home. Matt Stanton  an Alaris Health spokesman  said the facility had taken proper precautions to protect residents and staff members from “a monster of a problem.” “We’ve been ahead of all state and federal guidelines throughout this entire process ” Mr. Stanton said. He said the home was hamstrung by a lack of available testing and had enough protective gear for workers. He also said it was “completely false” that sick workers were being asked to show up to work. As families and homes scrambled to keep up  often the only choices were bad ones. Lisa Crowley  whose mother and stepfather are at the Veterans Home in Paramus  has watched helplessly as infections in the home multiplied. Finally  the home dedicated one wing to people with the coronavirus  with only two residents with no signs of infection. Those two are Ms. Crowley’s parents. “They have been told to stay in the room ” Ms. Crowley said. But she was worried because they shared a bathroom with other residents  and the same workers brought them meals. “They have no idea of the magnitude of what’s happening outside their door ” she said.

It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/nyregion/12nyvirus-nursing-p1/11nyvirus-nursinghomeNEW-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

A tractor mulches green beans at an R.C. Hatton farm in Florida. “It’s heartbreaking ” an owner of the farm said.Credit...Rose Marie Cromwell for The New York Times Supported by By David Yaffe-Bellany and Michael Corkery In Wisconsin and Ohio  farmers are dumping thousands of gallons of fresh milk into lagoons and manure pits. An Idaho farmer has dug huge ditches to bury 1 million pounds of onions. And in South Florida  a region that supplies much of the Eastern half of the United States with produce  tractors are crisscrossing bean and cabbage fields  plowing perfectly ripe vegetables back into the soil. After weeks of concern about shortages in grocery stores and mad scrambles to find the last box of pasta or toilet paper roll  many of the nation’s largest farms are struggling with another ghastly effect of the pandemic. They are being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they can no longer sell. The closing of restaurants  hotels and schools has left some farmers with no buyers for more than half their crops. And even as retailers see spikes in food sales to Americans who are now eating nearly every meal at home  the increases are not enough to absorb all of the perishable food that was planted weeks ago and intended for schools and businesses. The amount of waste is staggering. The nation’s largest dairy cooperative  Dairy Farmers of America  estimates that farmers are dumping as many as 3.7 million gallons of milk each day. A single chicken processor is smashing 750 000 unhatched eggs every week. Many farmers say they have donated part of the surplus to food banks and Meals on Wheels programs  which have been overwhelmed with demand. But there is only so much perishable food that charities with limited numbers of refrigerators and volunteers can absorb. And the costs of harvesting  processing and then transporting produce and milk to food banks or other areas of need would put further financial strain on farms that have seen half their paying customers disappear. Exporting much of the excess food is not feasible either  farmers say  because many international customers are also struggling through the pandemic and recent currency fluctuations make exports unprofitable. “It’s heartbreaking ” said Paul Allen  co-owner of R.C. Hatton  who has had to destroy millions of pounds of beans and cabbage at his farms in South Florida and Georgia. The widespread destruction of fresh food — at a time when many Americans are hurting financially and millions are suddenly out of work — is an especially dystopian turn of events  even by the standards of a global pandemic. It reflects the profound economic uncertainty wrought by the virus and how difficult it has been for huge sectors of the economy  like agriculture  to adjust to such a sudden change in how they must operate. Even as Mr. Allen and other farmers have been plowing fresh vegetables into the soil  they have had to plant the same crop again  hoping the economy will have restarted by the time the next batch of vegetables is ready to harvest. But if the food service industry remains closed  then those crops  too  may have to be destroyed. Farmers are also learning in real time about the nation’s consumption habits. The quarantines have shown just how many more vegetables Americans eat when meals are prepared for them in restaurants than when they have to cook for themselves. “People don’t make onion rings at home ” said Shay Myers  a third-generation onion farmer whose fields straddle the border of Oregon and Idaho. Mr. Myers said there were no good solutions to the fresh food glut. After his largest customer — the restaurant industry — shut down in California and New York  his farm started redistributing onions from 50-pound sacks into smaller bags that could be sold in grocery stores. He also started freezing some onions  but he has limited cold-storage capacity. With few other options  Mr. Myers has begun burying tens of thousands of pounds of onions and leaving them to decompose in trenches. “There is no way to redistribute the quantities that we are talking about ” he said. Over the decades  the nation’s food banks have tried to shift from offering mostly processed meals to serving fresh produce  as well. But the pandemic has caused a shortage of volunteers  making it more difficult to serve fruits and vegetables  which are time-consuming and expensive to transport. “To purchase from a whole new set of farmers and suppliers — it takes time  it takes knowledge  you have to find the people  develop the contracts ” said Janet Poppendieck  an expert on poverty and food assistance. The waste has become especially severe in the dairy industry  where cows need to be milked multiple times a day  regardless of whether there are buyers. Major consumers of dairy  like public schools and coffee shops  have all but vanished  leaving milk processing plants with fewer customers at a time of year when cows produce milk at their fastest rate. About 5 percent of the country’s milk supply is currently being dumped and that amount is expected to double if the closings are extended over the next few months  according to the International Dairy Foods Association. Before the pandemic  the Dairymens processing plant in Cleveland would produce three loads of milk  or around 13 500 gallons  for Starbucks every day. Now the Starbucks order is down to one load every three days. For a while after the pandemic took hold  the plant collected twice as much milk from farmers as it could process  keeping the excess supply in refrigerated trailers  said Brian Funk  who works for Dairymens as a liaison to farmers. But eventually the plant ran out of storage. One night last week  Mr. Funk worked until 11 p.m.  fighting back tears as he called farmers who supply the plant to explain the predicament. “We’re not going to pick your milk up tomorrow ” he told them. “We don’t have any place to put it.” One of the farms that got the call was the Hartschuh Dairy Farm  which has nearly 200 cows on a plot of land in northern Ohio. A week ago  Rose Hartschuh  who runs the farm with her family  watched her father-in-law flush 31 000 pounds of milk into a lagoon. It took more than an hour for the milk to flow out of its refrigerated tank and down the drain pipe. For years  dairy farmers have struggled with low prices and bankruptcies. “This is one more blow below the belt ” Ms. Hartschuh said. To prevent further dumping  farming groups are trying everything to find places to send the excess milk — even lobbying pizza chains to increase the amount of cheese on every slice. But there are logistical obstacles that prevent dairy products from being shifted neatly from food service customers to retailers. At many dairy processors  for example  the machinery is designed to package shredded cheese in large bags for restaurants or place milk in small cartons for schools  rather than arrange the products in retail-friendly containers. To repurpose those plants to put cheese in the 8 oz. bags that sell in grocery stores or bottle milk in gallon jugs would require millions of dollars in investment. For now  some processors have concluded that spending the money isn’t worth it. “It isn’t like restaurant demand has disappeared forever ” said Matt Gould  a dairy industry analyst. “Even if it were possible to re-format to make it an 8-ounce package rather than a 20-pound bag  the dollars and cents may not pan out.” Those same logistical challenges are bedeviling poultry plants that were set up to distribute chicken to restaurants rather than stores. Each week  the chicken processor Sanderson Farms destroys 750 000 unhatched eggs  or 5.5 percent of its total production  sending them to a rendering plant to be turned into pet food. Last week  the chief executive of Sanderson Farms  Joe Sanderson  told analysts that company officials had even considered euthanizing chickens to avoid selling them at unprofitable rates  though the company ultimately did not take that step. In recent days  Sanderson Farms has donated some of its chicken to food banks and organizations that cook meals for emergency medical workers. But hatching hundreds of thousands of eggs for the purpose of charity is not a viable option  said Mike Cockrell  the company’s chief financial officer. “We’re set up to sell that chicken ” Mr. Cockrell said. “That would be an expensive proposition.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.

11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/biden-cuomo-coronavirus.html, us politics, Biden and Cuomo: Friends  Allies and Supporting Players No Longer, A personal friendship has grown into a crucial political alliance as the two men have emerged as pillars of the Democratic Party in a national crisis., Supported by A personal friendship has grown into a crucial political alliance as the two men have emerged as pillars of the Democratic Party in a national crisis. By Alexander Burns In late July of 2015  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traversed the state of New York with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  ending the day in Queens  where they announced plans to rebuild La Guardia Airport. On a flight with Mr. Cuomo aboard Air Force Two  Mr. Biden broached a delicate subject: his own interest in the presidency. Like most Democratic Party leaders  Mr. Cuomo was supporting Hillary Clinton  who had a wide lead in the polls. But unlike other top Democrats — including former President Barack Obama — Mr. Cuomo did not attempt to dissuade Mr. Biden from running. Instead  over what associates to both men described as a monthslong series of conversations  the governor offered a sympathetic ear to an indecisive elder statesman. Mr. Biden later recounted in a memoir that Mr. Cuomo urged him to make a decision he could be at peace with  alluding to the similarly anguished deliberations of his father  former Gov. Mario Cuomo  decades earlier. “You’ll live with it the rest of your life ” Mr. Biden recalled the younger Mr. Cuomo saying. Mr. Cuomo’s warm posture toward Mr. Biden raised eyebrows in Mrs. Clinton’s camp: Her aides wondered if the governor was currying favor with the Obama administration. But Mr. Cuomo offered a simpler explanation  telling allies he believed Mr. Biden would ultimately choose not to run but insisting that the vice president deserved the space to make a decision on his own terms. The episode earned Mr. Biden’s lasting appreciation  and helped cement a personal friendship that has grown into a crucial political alliance. Five years later  the two men have arrived together at an extraordinary moment: Mr. Biden  77  and Mr. Cuomo  62  have emerged as unlikely twin pillars of their party in a national crisis  Mr. Biden as its presumptive presidential nominee and Mr. Cuomo as its most forceful spokesman in a public-health emergency. The political stakes for both men — and for their relationship — are almost unimaginably high  all the more so because of their overlapping and complementary vulnerabilities. Both are long-serving moderate stalwarts in a Democratic Party that has shifted leftward  and old-school practitioners of back-room politics in a culture that has sped up and moved online. Accentuating those challenges  Mr. Biden has struggled for years with a reputation for bombast and verbal indiscipline  while Mr. Cuomo has drawn complaints for an imperious and bullying personal style. They have turned to each other as allies during taxing moments in the past: Much as Mr. Biden consulted with Mr. Cuomo in 2015  the governor appealed to Mr. Biden for help three years later when he faced a primary challenge from the left. But now they are facing the greatest public trial of their lives — and counting on the resiliency of their relationship to help them navigate it. At times  the current circumstances might have threatened to push them into competition. In recent weeks Mr. Biden has struggled to make himself heard in the din of a national crisis while Mr. Cuomo  whose daily virus updates have drawn widespread praise  has stirred Democratic fantasies of a commanding and articulate governor somehow emerging as a white-knight challenger to President Trump. Mr. Trump himself has sought to stoke some kind of feud between them  opining on Fox & Friends that Mr. Cuomo would make “a better candidate than Sleepy Joe.” There have been moments of political friction over the last year  brief sparks between their camps if not between them. Mr. Cuomo complained privately for much of 2019 that Mr. Biden’s campaign was not responsive to governors like himself  and questioned whether the campaign was adequately prepared to contest New York’s primary. Advisers to Mr. Biden  meanwhile  were frustrated when Mr. Cuomo  who expressed early enthusiasm for Mr. Biden’s campaign  specifically noted last summer that he had not yet issued a formal endorsement. Still  the relationship between the two men in this moment has been defined not by resentment but private consultation and public expressions of affection  people close to both men said. Mr. Biden has called Mr. Cuomo’s role in the coronavirus crisis a national “lesson in leadership ” while Mr. Cuomo went on the CNN show hosted by his younger brother  Chris  to hail Mr. Biden as a “great public servant.” Recently  Mr. Biden and Mr. Cuomo are said to have spoken about every two days  and their political advisers speak at least as frequently. On a personal level  their allies say  Mr. Biden and Mr. Cuomo enjoy an easy rapport that has matured into a deeper friendship. In 2015  their candid conversations about the presidency took place in a period of mourning for both men: Mr. Biden had recently lost his son  Beau  to brain cancer. Mr. Cuomo was still mourning his father  who died on New Year’s Day. Mr. Biden traveled to New York for Mario Cuomo’s wake  and Mr. Cuomo attended Beau Biden’s wake in Dover  Del. Accompanying friendship has been a political partnership. Mr. Cuomo viewed Mr. Biden as a singularly helpful ally in the Obama administration  and appealed to him personally for federal support for the rebuilding of the Tappan Zee Bridge (rechristened since as the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.) Mr. Biden also served as a character witness for Mr. Cuomo in his 2018 campaign when the actor and activist Cynthia Nixon accused him of corruption and dishonesty in a bitter fight for the Democratic nomination. For Mr. Cuomo  viewed in New York as adhering to the maxim that politicians should have fewer permanent friends than permanent interests  his attitude of deference toward Mr. Biden marks a rare exception. “He just sees Joe Biden as a morally decent guy  the same way I know he saw his own father  in that sense ” said Jay Jacobs  a close ally of Mr. Cuomo who is chairman of the New York Democratic Party. Mr. Cuomo has never lunged at presidential races the way Mr. Biden has done repeatedly; even this time  when the Democratic field was wide open  Mr. Cuomo did little to advance the presidential ambitions that are quietly recognized among his allies. Mr. Biden was seen as one reason for the governor’s forbearance: “I think those of us who think Andrew Cuomo would be a great president would have had a much easier time convincing him to run if Joe Biden wasn’t running ” Mr. Jacobs said. On Saturday  Mr. Cuomo batted away a question about his prospects for the presidency  calling such speculation “flattering” but “irrelevant.” He also seemed to rule out — for now  anyway — serving in a Biden administration  saying he would not leave Albany for a Cabinet post: “I’m staying right here ” Mr. Cuomo said. The current election season is not the first time Mr. Biden has been upstaged during a presidential race by a governor in Albany named Cuomo. Mr. Biden’s first such encounter was inauspicious. Seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 1987  Mr. Biden  then 44  made a dismissive remark in Iowa suggesting governors were “uniquely unequipped to understand a broad range of issues that a senator has to deal with.” The comments drew a stern reaction from Mario Cuomo  who was then exciting liberals and overshadowing much of his party’s presidential field by publicly mulling a campaign of his own. He called Mr. Biden’s comment “one of the dumbest statements” of the election  prompting an apologetic phone call from Mr. Biden. But Mario Cuomo never became a candidate that year  and Mr. Biden’s campaign soon disintegrated amid a plagiarism scandal. Yet as the possibility that they would become direct competitors faded  a tone of greater respect crept into their public comments. Mario Cuomo expressed open admiration for Mr. Biden’s conduct during the confirmation hearings of Robert H. Bork  and suggested Mr. Biden would make a good keynote speaker at the 1988 Democratic convention. (The keynote went to Ann Richards  the future governor of Texas; another major speaking slot went to a 41-year-old governor of Arkansas  Bill Clinton  whose rapid rise would soon lock Mr. Biden and Mr. Cuomo out of the presidency.) Valerie Biden Owens  the former vice president’s sister  said in an interview that it had long been evident to her that the Bidens and the Cuomos shared a common set of social values that she described as anchored in their Irish and Italian Catholic heritage. Of the elder Gov. Cuomo  Ms. Owens said  “I know my brother respected him greatly.” “Both of them speak to  and practice  the basics of Catholic social justice  and that’s how we were raised ” Ms. Owens said. It was a few years into the new century — and through a younger generation — that the families developed a tighter bond  when Mr. Cuomo and Beau Biden were elected the attorneys general of New York and Delaware in 2006. In 2017  the former vice president wrote in his memoir that Mr. Cuomo “told me he and Beau used to commiserate about being aspiring politicians who were also the sons of well-known officeholders.” As vice president  Mr. Biden appeared beside Mr. Cuomo in several crucial moments  including during New York’s recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Mr. Biden put his political muscle behind Mr. Cuomo in earnest in 2018  helping him against Ms. Nixon. His intervention was problematic for the left: While Ms. Nixon and her allies regularly denounced the Democratic establishment and big donors for lining up behind Mr. Cuomo  they saw little advantage in sparring with a popular figure like Mr. Biden. Facing resistance from progressives who viewed him as an iron-fisted centrist  Mr. Cuomo’s team asked Mr. Biden to appear with him at the New York Democratic Party’s convention. Mr. Biden agreed. When they asked Mr. Biden to record a television ad for Mr. Cuomo backstage  he agreed again. When the Cuomo team asked several weeks later if Mr. Biden would record a new ad — the first one was not quite right — he agreed yet again  allowing a film crew into his Delaware home to record a commercial that soon blanketed the airwaves in New York. Randi Weingarten  the president of the American Federation of Teachers  said Mr. Biden’s intervention in the 2018 race had helped Mr. Cuomo secure a third term. She called Mr. Biden’s speech at the state convention an important moment of validation for the governor. “Biden is so empathetic and is seen as being such a decent man  and that was very important at that moment for Andrew Cuomo ” said Ms. Weingarten  who like other Democrats  saw a similar  perhaps anachronistic political sensibility binding the two men. “Biden is a politician from a different age  when a sense of having somebody’s back  based upon the values you carry and the work you’ve done together  means something ” she said  adding  “That’s something that Cuomo and Biden share very  very deeply.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/world/europe/italy-priests-coronavirus.html, world europe, As They Console Coronavirus’s Victims  Italy’s Priests Are Dying  Too, Doctors and nurses on the front line have become symbols of sacrifice  but priests and nuns have also joined the fight  often at great risk., Supported by Doctors and nurses on the front line have become symbols of sacrifice  but priests and nuns have also joined the fight  often at great risk. By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo ROME — On the Sunday before Easter  the priest’s phone rang. The Rev. Claudio Del Monte carried the phone  given to him by staff in the Bergamo hospital  along with a small cross and some homemade sanitizer. Instead of his usual cleric’s collar  he wore disposable scrubs  a surgical mask covered with another mask  protective eyewear and a cap over his head. On his chest he had drawn a black cross with a felt pen. He excused himself from two coronavirus patients he was visiting in the hospital and answered the call. But he already knew what it meant. Minutes later  he arrived at the bedside of an older man he had met days earlier. An oxygen mask now obscured the man’s face  and intensive care staff huddled around his bed. “I blessed him and absolved him from sins  he squeezed my hand tightly and I stayed there with him until his eyes closed ” Father Del Monte  53  said. “And then I said the prayer for the dead  and then I changed my gloves and continued my round.” Italy’s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world’s deadliest  and while the doctors and nurses on the northern Italian front line have become symbols of sacrifice against an invisible enemy  priests and nuns have also joined the fight. Especially in deeply infected areas like Bergamo  they are risking  and sometimes giving  their lives to attend to the spiritual needs of the often older and devout Italians hardest hit by the virus. Across Italy  the virus has killed more than 100 priests  many of them retired and especially vulnerable to a scourge that preys on older people  whether it be in nursing homes or monasteries. Avvenire  the newspaper run by the Italian bishops conference  is honoring the dead with the hashtag “PriestsForever.” But some priests have also fallen in service  and in a Holy Thursday Mass in an empty St. Peter’s Basilica  Pope Francis remembered them. “In these days  more than 60 have died here in Italy  attending to the sick in the hospitals ” he said  calling them “the saints next door  priests who gave their lives in service.” Francesco Beschi  the bishop of Bergamo  said he had lost 24 priests in 20 days  in a region where more than 2 600 people have died of the virus by the official count. About half the priests were retired and out of service  but others still tended to pastoral duties. They offer solace through WhatsApp groups  wave from behind car windows as they bring food to the sick  lean against the door frames of infected bedrooms as they deliver last rites and shroud themselves in personal protective equipment as they whisper prayers and encouragement at hospital bed sides. They complain they cannot get closer  that the last touch the faithful feel is a gloved one  that the last face they see is often on a screen. With a virus that separates families and spouses as it kills  priests said that they were also pained to be distanced from their flock when they were needed most. One of those was the Rev. Fausto Resmini  67  esteemed as the chaplain of Bergamo’s prison for nearly 30 years and the founder of a center for troubled youth. His fellow priests said that in the course of his work last month  he caught the virus. He received treatment at the Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital where Father Del Monte does his rounds  before dying on March 23. Local residents are trying to name a new field hospital after him. “His death is a huge loss for the Bergamo church ” said the Rev. Roberto Trussardi  director of Bergamo Caritas  the church’s charitable arm. Such sacrifices have not deterred many other priests from ministering to the sick. “Staying home is the right thing to do ” said the Rev. Giovanni Paolini  85  in the central Italian town of Pesaro. “But I am a priest and sometimes it is necessary to bend the law to meet people’s needs.” On Monday  he said a burial prayer for one of the 15 members of a local parish killed by the virus. He said he used the phone or social media when possible to console. But he also said he puts on his mask and other protective gear to visit old people fearing death  often alone. “You choose this life to be useful to others ” he said. Those priests embody a vision of the church articulated by Pope Francis  who has often invoked the image of a field hospital and the characters of the Italian masterpiece  “The Betrothed ” in which heroic Milanese priests selflessly treat those afflicted by the plague. On March 10  Francis prayed in a morning Mass  “for our priests  so that they have the courage to go out  and go to those who are sick.” That encouragement seemed in violation of restrictions Italy adopted that very day that sought to keep people in their homes to prevent the spread of the virus  but the Vatican’s spokesman immediately argued that the pope’s appeal clearly understood the need for priests to act “while respecting the health measures established by Italian authorities.” Cardinal Michael Czerny  a close adviser to Francis  said that the pontiff has seemed calm but also intensely involved in the church’s response to the virus in recent days. “What makes him most happy are the priests who don’t need to be told  but who know that this is what they should do ” he said. “If he had his druthers  he would be on the front lines  too.” “He wants us at the frontiers ” Cardinal Czerny said. “And beyond the limits.” Those limits are not safely placed. And once the danger of contagion became clear  Bishop Beschi said  priests began adopting the appropriate precautions. He had sent a letter to his own priests telling them  “We want to bring Christ to people but not contagion.” He added  “This was a painful choice  because it was a limitation.” In Castiglione d’Adda  one of the first towns quarantined by the Italian government during the initial February outbreak  nearly all public religious ceremonies and services have ceased. The Rev. Gabriele Bernardelli  58  said he kept contact with his parishioners through WhatsApp and Instagram. The phone  he said  “becomes a pastoral instrument.” But he said that the vast majority of the 67 people his town lost in the last 40 days had died in the hospital  and that he had not been able to see them. He took some solace in the fact that local bishops had deputized devout medical workers in hospitals to make the sign of the cross on a dying patient’s forehead. Last month  during the explosion of cases  Father Bernardelli visited the home of an older man  the father of a priest  as he lay dying in his bedroom. “I used to be close to a dying person  like a doctor next to the sick ” he said. This time he stayed at the threshold of the door watching the man clutch a tank of oxygen. Father Bernardelli delivered last rites through a mask from outside the door frame. “This is what you can do ” he said. Father Del Monte also visits the sick at home. A chemist by training  he has made vats of disinfectant. He dabs it in his nostrils and rubs it on his hands. The precautions were both to protect himself and to make sure that he did not inadvertently spread the virus himself  as he goes home to home. “Like all my priest friends  we go around to the houses ’’ he said  ‘‘so we cannot be the ones who bring the contagion. We cannot only get the sickness  we can give it. Maybe we are asymptomatic  and then it’s a disaster.” Last week  he too delivered last rites in a mask from the threshold of a bedroom  this time for a woman in his parish. He added that on Monday morning  he said simple prayers at the Bergamo cemetery during a burial. “Three or four minutes ” he said. Before 3 every afternoon  he leaves his parish  changes out of his clerical clothing and gets dressed for visits in the hospital  which falls within his parish. He has comforted wives whose husbands died in other hospitals and lingered when doctors rushed off. “The priest’s time is freer ” he said  adding  “It’s not about looking for it  it’s about accepting the suffering that comes.” Sometimes he sees new patients taking the place of the dead he prayed with the day before. But he has also found a letter on the bed of a patient who survived. “Until next time ” it read. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/world/12Italy-Priests1/merlin_171497892_95673bbd-4e37-4eb7-ad7e-e416ad0ee2a0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/coronavirus-survivors.html, us, ‘You Could Lick the Benches’: Life for the First Wave of U.S. Survivors, As the rest of the nation shelters in place  the first Americans to recover from the virus test drive immunity., Supported by As the rest of the nation shelters in place  the first Americans to recover from the virus test drive immunity. By Amy Harmon Christy Karras and her husband received a tantalizing text the other day from friends they had not seen since February  when all four were among the first people in the United States to be sickened by the new coronavirus. “Dinner at our place?” It had been a week and a half since any of them had experienced symptoms  past the point when Covid-19 patients are thought to be contagious. And  assuming conventional virology wisdom applies  they were not at risk of immediate re-infection. Ms. Karras had been told she was probably “one of the safest people in the country” by a researcher she asked. She and her husband  Bill Harper  who had each endured a weeklong headache as well as the disease’s hallmark fever and dry cough  longed for social interaction. “Let me check our calendars ” Ms. Karras typed back. “Oh  who are we kidding? Nothing on the calendar.” So it was that the two Seattle couples entered a phase of pandemic life that most of America can still only dream of. As recently as mid-March  fewer than 5 000 people in the United States had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Some are still coughing  or tethered to oxygen tanks. Many have died. But the first large wave of Covid-19 survivors  likely to be endowed with a power known to infectious disease specialists as adaptive immunity  is emerging. They linger in grocery store aisles and touch doorknobs without flinching. They undertake not entirely essential travel. They have friends over. They hug. With most Americans still desperate to avoid contracting the virus  and the number of known cases nearing half a million  several dozen spoke to The New York Times about what it was like to recover. Health care workers who have fallen ill and bounced back fill the hospital shifts of colleagues who are still at risk. Many who have overcome the infection  including some of America’s newly unemployed  donate blood to biotech companies and researchers seeking to manufacture treatments from their antibodies. They are giddy  they are grateful. “My son kept asking  ‘Is Daddy going to die? Is he going to die today?’” said Clement Chow  38  a college professor who has changed his Twitter handle to “Clement ‘I beat COVID19’ Chow.” The first Covid-19 patient at the University of Utah’s intensive care unit  he recently received his all-clear. “It was good to be able to tell him no.” They are sometimes guilt-ridden  about possibly having spread the disease before its existence was widely known  and about recovering when others did not. “The death toll from our ship is 11 ” said Carl Goldman  67  who spent 29 days in a Nebraska biocontainment unit after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship  which in mid-February was home to the highest concentration of coronavirus cases outside of China. “That could have been any one of us.” In Italy  some public officials have proposed issuing “immunity certificates” that would allow those with antibodies to the virus to move freely and return to work — an ethically fraught concept also under discussion by the White House’s coronavirus task force. Even in the absence of public policy  people who have recuperated from Covid-19 say they are wondering about the responsibilities that come with the powers of probable immunity. “I am acutely aware of the privilege I have in not being afraid ” wrote Ms. Karras  a writer and editor in her mid-40s  in a recent Seattle Times column. But uncertainties abound. While Dr. Anthony Fauci  the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases  has said he is “really confident” that people who recover are protected against re-infection  there is no perfect test for immunity  and it is not clear yet how long it may last. Guidance from health officials as to the precise moment people who had been infected can no longer infect others is often conflicting  and testing is often not available to confirm when a person is virus-free. Some Covid-19 survivors face stigma from neighbors who know they had been sick. On the night of their outing  Ms. Karras and her husband brought good wine they had been saving for a special occasion. Their friends ordered out from a local barbecue place. Everyone talked loudly  the couple recalled  and often at the same time. They agreed not to post any photos of the reunion on social media. As much as they wanted to send a message of hope  they were at pains to avoid giving off the impression they were gloating. “There aren’t that many people yet who had it and are well ” said Ms. Karras. “It’s like it’s up to us to figure out how to be.” Elizabeth Schneider hated to appear to be violating rules that were meant to protect others  and that she knew relied on collective determination to enforce. But the state health department said people who had tested positive for the coronavirus were allowed to leave self-isolation seven days after their first symptom and three days after their last fever. By those metrics  she was free to fly from Seattle to Tucson  Ariz.  to visit her parents. Ms. Schneider  37  who holds a doctorate in bioengineering  had read the study about monkeys that indicated survivors of the new coronavirus would  at least at first  be resistant to further infection. She would be more useful in Tucson  she had reasoned  as her family’s designated grocery shopper. Especially since her mother has asthma  which puts her at a higher risk for a poor outcome should she contract the virus. But re-entry to a society that is largely shut down can also come with a new sense of isolation  Ms. Schneider found. “I thought to myself  ‘Should I mention to them that I had it?’” she said of her fellow passengers on her mostly empty flight  all of whom were talking about Covid-19. “Ultimately I chickened out.” For Ms. Schneider  who lives alone and had isolated herself for two weeks after her early-March test  the time with her parents  playing board games and cooking familiar recipes  was restorative. The flight she was supposed to take back to Seattle  however  was canceled because of a lack of passengers. And on the flight she was able to find  there were so few fliers that she would have had no opportunity to speak to anyone even if she had wanted to. “Empty ” she texted. It was midway through Dr. Dara Kass’s first 12-hour shift back in the emergency room on a recent Sunday that she received the most definitive news one can currently get about immunity to the novel coronavirus. A few days before  Dr. Kass  who tested positive for the virus in March after treating Covid-19 patients at Columbia University Irving Medical Center  had given a blood sample to a study that she hoped would help others with the disease. The study  conducted by researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital  aims to use virus-fighting antibodies from donors who have recovered to treat patients who are currently sick. To determine eligibility  the volunteers’ blood is screened for the right antibodies. Those who have plenty are sent to a blood center to donate plasma in an hourlong process that can yield enough to treat three patients. She qualified. “They called me ” Dr. Kass said in a phone interview Sunday evening from the hospital  where the wails of ambulance sirens did not let up  and Covid-19  she said  “is everywhere.’’ That morning  Dr. Kass had tweeted a photograph of herself in the subway  wearing a mask. “On the way to my first ER shift in 3 weeks ” she wrote. She had already been prepared to step in on procedures  like for cardiac arrests  for colleagues who have not been infected. “When you find out you have antibodies you have a sense of obligation to just help ” she said. “Everyone else is doing a great job. But on some level  there’s a layer of  ‘You’re lucky enough to have had it.’” In the fifth century B.C.  the Greek historian Thucydides reported that survivors of the Plague of Athens were commandeered to administer to those suffering from it. In early 1776  George Washington  himself a smallpox survivor  sent only soldiers known to have recovered from the disease into Boston  where an outbreak had raged before the British evacuation. “People have understood for a long time that surviving an acute infection provides immunity ” said Michael Oldstone  an emeritus professor of virology and immunology at Scripps Research Institute  and author of the book “Viruses  Plagues and History.” That history  though  does not quell all the questions now in the heads of those convalescing from the new coronavirus. On Facebook groups like “Survivor Corps ” on their doctors’ voice mail  in messages to reporters  they ask questions that have no easy answers. When is it safe to go out? What does it mean that the fever is gone but taste and smell have not returned? Is it OK to hug one’s grandmother? Does a positive antibody test guarantee immunity? Some of the confusion has been exacerbated by a continued shortage of testing. And some of the urgency is fueled by the stigma now associated with being out and about. Walter Lamkin  69  general counsel for a company in St. Louis  Mo.  tested positive in March and was cleared by the St. Louis County public health department in early April. “I can’t infect anyone and I can’t be infected ” he said. But as the designated grocery shopper for his extended family  “people are judging me ” Mr. Lamkin said  and wondering whether he should be out. “Unless I get a negative test  I can’t answer that question.” But he has been told that he cannot get retested to confirm that he no longer has the virus because tests are reserved for people with symptoms. “OK  but if no one will test you  what are you supposed to do?” he asked. The thing to do  the thing that throngs of Covid-19 survivors are uniformly eager to do  it seems  is participate in antibody studies. “If there’s a chance I can help humankind  I’m in ” Rick Wright  of Redwood City  Calif.  said. In the case of Mr. Wright  who had tested positive multiple times over the course of several weeks but experienced no symptoms  the blood draw came to his home the moment his self-isolation order was lifted. A co-founder of the drug-discovery start-up Augmenta who read about him in The Times in early March had concluded that Mr. Wright’s antibodies might be particularly potent. On one recent evening  members of the Young Israel synagogue in New Rochelle  N.Y.  where many congregants tested positive in early March  watched a Zoom presentation by researchers from Rockefeller University about the value of donating plasma  while reviewing similar solicitations from scientists at the nearby Montefiore Medical Center. But plenty of erstwhile coronavirus patients need no persuasion. Jacob Brown  26  of Manhattan rode his bike five miles from the East Village to the Upper East Side to donate blood to the Mount Sinai study last week. Then he visited Rockefeller the next day to do the same. Mr. Brown  who has been laid off from two jobs as a result of the shrinking coronavirus economy  was not necessarily feeling flush with the power of immunity. But the blood donations  he said  made him feel better. “I’m not a health care worker so I can’t be in the trenches ” said Mr. Brown. “One of my friends was like  ‘You could lick the benches and you’ll be fine.’” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

Closes Schools for Academic Year  but Cuomo Says It’s His Decision, The mayor announced that in-person classes were suspended through June  but the governor countered that he had yet to make a call., Supported by The mayor announced that in-person classes were suspended through June  but the governor countered that he had yet to make a call. By Eliza Shapiro New York City’s public schools will remain closed through the end of the academic year because of the coronavirus  Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Saturday  confirming a disastrous scenario that he had previously warned of: more than three months of regular schooling for 1.1 million children would be lost. Roughly 1 800 schools across the city’s five boroughs have scrambled to adjust to remote learning since they were initially shuttered on March 16  a sudden shift that has presented educators with perhaps the largest challenge of their careers and turned well over one million parents into part-time teachers. The first few weeks of online learning have already transformed the relationships among the city’s students  parents and educators  who have come to rely on one another in ways unfathomable even a month ago. “Lord knows  having to tell you that we cannot bring our schools back for the remainder of this school year is painful ” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference. “But I can also tell you  it’s the right thing to do.” The extended closure in the nation’s largest school district marks a somber milestone for the most disruptive moment to American education in a generation. Mayors and governors across the country are weighing urgent public health concerns against the incalculable losses that vulnerable children in particular face when schools are shut down. The mayor said the decision to close schools was made on Friday evening  after he spoke with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Fauci supported the decision  Mr. de Blasio said. But soon after the mayor ended his news conference on Saturday  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at his own press briefing that there had been “no decision” on closing schools in the city or state. He described the mayor’s announcement as Mr. de Blasio’s “opinion.” The governor and mayor have been political rivals for years. New York City typically makes its own decisions about school closures  including snow days  though Mr. Cuomo said on Saturday that he had the legal authority to decide when public schools across the state reopen. Mr. Cuomo’s aides pointed to last month’s executive order requiring that public schools close  which included a provision that the governor would decide the length of the closures. The governor said he wanted to coordinate city schools’ reopening date with the rest of the state and  ideally  with New Jersey and Connecticut. He said a final call was “not going to be decided in the next few days.” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said on Saturday that “harmony in the region would be a good thing.” Still  it seems highly unlikely that Mr. Cuomo will reopen New York City schools in defiance of Mr. de Blasio. Many other districts across the country have already said they intend to keep schools closed for the academic year. During a television appearance on Saturday night  the mayor asserted his power to make decisions about city schools  and said his decision was about keeping students and educators safe. “I run the school system ” along with the schools chancellor  Richard A. Carranza  Mr. de Blasio said  citing mayoral control of city schools. The mayor said that he would work with the governor  but that he did not have responsibility “to another elected official. My responsibility is to those kids.” At his earlier news briefing  Mr. de Blasio noted that the city was preparing to reopen schools as scheduled in September  and he emphasized that the next academic year might be the most important in the city’s history. This fall  he added  would mark “a new era” for the system  with supports to help schoolchildren catch up on lost instruction. But those efforts would come too late for many high school seniors; the mayor said the city was working to ensure that seniors graduate on time  even if there is no graduation ceremony. Though some parents have asked whether schools could reopen during the summer break  Mr. de Blasio said that was not likely. The city’s teachers union  the United Federation of Teachers  has signaled that it would not support opening schools in July or August. Unions for the city’s principals and its teachers released statements in support of keeping schools closed. Mr. de Blasio said educators’ ability to abruptly switch to remote learning would be remembered as one of the “heroic passages” of the coronavirus crisis. Early last month  Mr. de Blasio faced pressure from parents and teachers to close schools as the virus began its spread through New York City. After first resisting  the mayor ultimately shut the system  saying  “This is not something in a million years I could have imagined having to do.” The political squabbling between the governor and the mayor on Saturday was reminiscent of their handling of the initial shutdown of the city’s schools in mid-March. On the morning of March 15  both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio were resisting closures. But in the afternoon  Mr. Cuomo appeared on CNN a few minutes before Mr. de Blasio’s scheduled news conference to say the schools would temporarily shutter. A few minutes later  the mayor announced the same. Though New York is the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus outbreak  more than a dozen states  including California  Pennsylvania and Washington  have indicated that their public schools will remain closed through the end of the academic year. Many states and districts that initially avoided issuing long-term cancellations of in-person classes have done so in recent weeks  as coronavirus cases and deaths have continued to rise. New York City’s public school system is highly segregated by race and socioeconomic status  and remote learning has revealed new depths of inequality. Many students do not have internet access or laptops at home  and the city rushed to lend about 175 000 laptops and Chromebooks and 66 000 iPads to children who needed them. Mr. de Blasio announced on Saturday that schools would  by the end of April  distribute about 200 000 more devices to families. About three-quarters of the city’s public schoolchildren are in low-income households and qualify for free or reduced-price lunches  prompting officials to leave some school buildings open for families to pick up meals in the morning  as well as for other struggling New Yorkers to get food in the afternoon. Mr. de Blasio said last week that the city had distributed over 2.6 million meals to residents through open school buildings since late March. The city is also operating 57 “regional enrichment centers ” where essential employees can leave their children while they work. The city also has about 114 000 homeless students  who have had to adapt to remote learning in shelters and cramped homes where they might share a single room with five family members. New York also has about 200 000 students with disabilities — or roughly as many total students in some cities’ public school systems. Now  scores of service providers are experimenting with ways to deliver complex physical and occupational therapies remotely. Despite these efforts  many children with advanced special needs will fall behind academically and socially. Some students with disabilities are in school 12 months per year  but Mr. de Blasio said on Saturday that it was not yet clear whether those students would return to school even during the summer. While New York City’s education leaders have insisted on continuing remote learning even as other districts have stopped classes altogether  no one has argued that online education is an equal substitute for attending a physical school. The loss of learning and social interaction brought on by the months of school closures are enormous  and the full consequences of the shutdown will never be completely known. But the virus has already changed the school system even beyond the mass closures: The economic crisis created by the pandemic has led to significant budget cuts. The city has cut funding for school budgets  as well as some professional development for educators  after-school programs and the expansion of prekindergarten for 3-year-olds. Some elected officials were particularly alarmed that funding was cut for the city’s summer youth employment program  which matches thousands of low-income students with jobs. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/nyregion/12nyvirus-schools-print1/00nyvirus-schools-hfo-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/28/multimedia/author-eliza-shapiro/author-eliza-shapiro-thumbLarge.png

Its Fate Was to Fade Away., Malacca gave birth to the notion of Asian Fusion centuries before it became a culinary trope. Its decline speaks to the promise and perils of globalization., Supported by Malaysia Dispatch Malacca gave birth to the notion of Asian Fusion centuries before it became a culinary trope. Its decline speaks to the promise and perils of globalization. By Hannah Beech Photographs by Adam Dean MALACCA  Malaysia — About the fastest moving force these days in the old Portuguese Settlement of Malacca is the sweat trickling down the torsos of the underemployed. In the stifling heat — it’s always hot in Malacca — a group of such shirtless men were sprawled under the shade of a tree  hoping to catch the slightest sea breeze  but the winds weren’t cooperating. A few nearby dinghies had no oars  but it didn’t matter. The fish weren’t biting anyway. This place wasn’t always so lethargic. In fact  in the 16th century  this port on the strategic Malacca Strait was positioned at the fulcrum of the world  linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans at the height of the global spice trade. Centuries before Asian Fusion became a culinary trope  Malacca developed its own intricately multicultural heritage  influenced by the crowds of Chinese  Arabs  Indians  Persians  Turks  Portuguese  Dutch and Siamese  along with the local Malays  who all did business in its shops  ate in its food stalls and fell in love on its streets. As the world pulls up its drawbridges during a time of pandemic and questions the merits of globalization  Malacca is a reminder that such transoceanic exchange has a long history of bringing both promise and peril. And the city’s ultimate fate may serve as a warning that the prosperity globalization bestows on some can be fickle and fleeting. A city that once stood at the global crossroads can devolve into a backwater  and a once-thriving culture can face extinction. Malacca’s port  once one of the richest on earth  silted up  and the city became a historical footnote. The spices that drove the age of exploration — nutmeg  cloves and mace — now molder in dusty cabinets  no longer treasured commodities. And yes  a contagion struck  too  a plague that weakened the Portuguese hold on the city  paving the way for the Dutch and then the British  who favored other entrepôts and left Malacca to its slow decline. Evidence of Malacca’s richly diverse past remains in its historical buildings  which lure tourists who are transported around town in disco-lit pedicabs. On what is known as Harmony Street stands a Chinese Buddhist temple built in the 17th century  a Hindu temple from the 18th  and one of Malaysia’s oldest mosques  which boasts Chinese eaves  Portuguese tiles  Corinthian columns and a Victorian chandelier. But one legacy of Malacca’s crossroads culture is struggling to survive in the 21st century: its Indigenous population of Eurasians  known as the Kristang  in reference to their Roman Catholic faith. They prospered during the port’s golden age as civil servants  fishermen  traders and musicians. But the Kristang culture faces enormous stresses in modern-day Malaysia  which is fracturing along ethnic fault lines. The Kristang language  a Portuguese creole  is facing extinction. Roman Catholic churches are emptying. Malaysian law all but requires Kristang who marry members of the ethnic Malay majority to convert to Islam. “Our community brought East and West together ” said Darian Tan  35  a Kristang digital marketer and the lead guitarist of a band made up of fellow Eurasians. “But now when everything is supposedly globalized  we’re in danger of dying out.” In late February  Malaysia’s only truly multiethnic government since the country achieved independence fell after just two years in power. A coalition dominated by Malay nationalists took its place  casting aside reformist ethnic Chinese and Indians. One minority member of the new government is an Islamic party that has pushed for the country to become an Islamic state. For Malacca’s multiethnic population  the return to populist Malay politics is provoking anxiety. Already  waves of ethnic Chinese Malaysians have emigrated as race-based quotas have limited their access to universities and the civil service. Many Kristang now live in Australia  Canada and Singapore. About 1 200 Kristang still live in the Portuguese Settlement area of Malacca  a part of the city that attracts few tourists. The settlement’s seafront faces a reclamation site for a vast Chinese-funded project called Melaka Gateway  which critics say is being used to strengthen Beijing’s grip on a geopolitically vital maritime choke point. 200 MILES VIETNAM THAILAND South China Sea Malacca Strait MALAYSIA Kuala Lumpur Malacca Indian Ocean SINGAPORE SUMATRA 1/2 MILE St. Peter’s Church 19 5 Christ Church Malacca Portuguese Settlement 192 portuguese square Melaka Gateway Malacca Strait Map data by OpenStreetMap By The New York Times All the sand that has been moved around for the project has upended cockles and disrupted migration patterns for pomfret and shrimp — a devastating blow for Kristang fishermen  who have seen their ranks decrease by half over the past couple of decades. “We’re not against development  but we are against something that is destroying a unique 500-year-old community ” said Martin Theseira  a Kristang local councilor who used to fish and make his own preserved seafood. The Portuguese Square at the heart of the settlement is not a square at all. Instead  it is mostly a parking lot with a few restaurants selling Portuguese-inflected seafood. Tinsel garlands left over from Christmas decorate some of their sun-baked signs. During the heat of the day  Malay youth come to joy ride on the concrete expanse  tracing doughnuts with their air-conditioned sports cars. The Kristang shake their heads but there is nothing they can do. Near the entrance to the Portuguese Square is a statue of Jesus Christ the Redeemer  like the one in Rio de Janeiro. For years  the statue in Malacca lacked a head because conservative Muslims deemed it an idolatrous perversion. The figure was recapitated in 2017 but is still missing the proper permits. Kristang community organizers fear the statue could be destroyed if local officials give in to religious conservatives. Behind the shade tree where Kristang men gather is the empty hulk of a building that was originally conceived of as the Lisbon Hotel. Tourists  the Kristang hoped  would flock there to revel in the community’s many festivals. But management of the hotel fell into Malay hands. Alcohol was frowned upon and unmarried couples were discouraged from reserving rooms. “We love our festivals ” said Mr. Theseira  the local politician. “What’s a festival without wine and dancing?” The Kristang language fuses an archaic Portuguese with Malay grammar. Philomena Singho teaches it on Facebook  through videos she films in her crucifix-decorated living room in the Portuguese Settlement. She is fluent in Papía Kristang but concedes that only a couple of thousand others speak the language with true proficiency. Even fewer are passing on the language to their children. “I’m trying my best  but I’m worried that in one generation it could be almost gone ” she said. Ms. Singho said she has Portuguese  Armenian  Dutch  Malay and Sri Lankan bloodlines. There are a couple of other ethnicities  too  she said. “We’re mixed up in a good way ” she said. The Kristang owe their existence to the initial Portuguese tradition of not sending women out to their colonies. Instead  men were encouraged through tax breaks and other incentives to pair with local women. (Other imperial powers  like the British  would discourage such mixed marriages  prizing racial purity.) In Goa  Portugal’s first territorial possession in Asia  as well as other Portuguese outposts like Macau on the Chinese coast  Eurasian communities thrived. Their cuisines were enriched by colonial crosscurrents  so that a chili-slathered chicken from Mozambique  another Portuguese colony  evolved into a popular Macanese dish seasoned with soy sauce. In Malacca  a wine-rich braise that was a favorite in Lisbon was refracted as devil curry  a fiercely spicy stew traditionally made with Christmas meats and vinegar. Today  in Malaysia  the Kristang are known mostly for their curries and sweetmeats or for their guitar-playing troubadours — a once-vibrant community diminished to cultural clichés. “If we’re going to survive another 500 years ” Mr. Theseira said  “it can’t just be singing and dancing and eating.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/world/12malacca-dispatch/merlin_169924689_1a576719-09f3-42dc-8bfc-d4efaba4f2d3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

A larger-than-typical fire is stirring up radiation  though levels remain normal in Kyiv  the Ukrainian capital., Supported by Wildfires are common in the so-called Zone of Alienation around the abandoned Chernobyl plant. A larger-than-typical fire is stirring up radiation  though levels remain normal in Kyiv  the Ukrainian capital. By Maria Varenikova VINNYTSIA  Ukraine — Firefighters have struggled to control wildfires burning through radioactive forest in the abandoned territory around the Chernobyl nuclear plant  where radiation levels are considerably lower than they were immediately after the 1986 accident but still pose risks. Radiation readings near the wildfires  where smoke is swirling about  have been elevated  with the wind blowing toward rural areas of Russia and Belarus for most of the past week. The wind shifted Friday toward Kyiv  the Ukrainian capital  but authorities say the radiation level is still normal in the city  whose population is about three million. But Saturday’s strong winds could spread the fires to the remnants of the nuclear plant and the equipment that was used to clean up the disaster  said Kateryna Pavlova  the acting head of the agency that oversees the area  in a telephone interview. “At the moment  we cannot say the fire is contained ” Ms. Pavlova said. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster  authorities created an area around the plant known as the Zone of Alienation  a rough circle with a nearly 18-mile radius  fenced off with barbed wire. Access to the zone is limited to workers who manage the site and tourists who take guided excursions. Over time  radiation has settled into the soil  where its half-life ticks away mostly harmlessly. But the roots of moss  trees and other vegetation have absorbed some radiation  bringing it to the surface and spreading radioactive particles in smoke when it burns. Already in lockdown because of the coronavirus  Ukraine is now also contending with fires in the post-apocalyptic landscape of the Chernobyl zone. Wildfires break out there often but the blazes burning through dry grass and pine forests this spring  after a warm and dry winter  are far larger than the typical brush fires in the Chernobyl zone. The Exclusion Zone Management Agency  the government office that manages the site  said the fires have burned through more than 8 600 acres over the past week. By Saturday  about 400 firefighters  100 fire engines and several helicopters had been deployed to the exclusion zone. According to the state center of radiation and nuclear safety  contaminated smoke is expected to reach Kyiv this weekend. However  the radiation level in the air  once smoke has disbursed far from the fires  is considered safe. It is expected to be about a hundredth of the level deemed an emergency. The Exclusion Zone Management Agency is trying to protect critical infrastructure in the Chernobyl zone  such as the plant itself and the so-called “graves ” or parking lots of abandoned  highly contaminated trucks and tracked vehicles that were left from the original disaster  officials said. “We have been working all night digging firebreaks around the plant to protect it from fire ” Ms. Pavlova said. The cause has not been determined. One possibility is that a fire started intentionally by farmers to clear stubble from nearby fields had spread into the zone. The Zone of Alienation is an eerie landscape of abandoned villages  equipment “graves ” empty fields and dense pine and birch forests  set aside in perpetuity as an experiment in mitigating nuclear disaster. The idea was to limit  through isolation  the lethality of radiation. The danger is minimal today. Scientists say the average radiation level in the zone is about a quarter as harmful to human health as it was in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire. Radioactive elements degrade at predictable intervals  called half-lives  that can vary enormously. The average particle half-life at Chernobyl is about 30 years. The main risk from the fires comes from inhaling  via the smoke  small radioactive particles thrown years ago from the open core of the Chernobyl reactor  said Olena Miskun  an air pollution expert with Ecodiya  an environmental advocacy group. “Wind can raise hot particles in the air together with the ash and blow it toward populated areas ” Ms. Miskun says. Also  radioactive particles can land on gardens or fields and later be consumed in food. “We are lucky to have quarantine measures in place now ” she said. “People stay at home  walk less and wear masks ” anyway  because of the coronavirus threat.

11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/wisconsin-politics.html, us politics, ‘Not as Wisconsin Nice as We Used to Be’: The Divisions in Dairyland, Keeping the polls open in a pandemic is just one example of the state pushing political partisanship to the extreme., Supported by Keeping the polls open in a pandemic is just one example of the state pushing political partisanship to the extreme. By Dionne Searcey MADISON  Wis. — The Wisconsin State Legislature couldn’t agree on who to honor for Black History Month. It couldn’t hold a special session on gun violence that lasted more than a few seconds. It had stalled for weeks on releasing money to help farmers struggling with mental health issues. So Brad Pfaff wasn’t all that shocked that  because of a partisan standoff over postponing the election  thousands of mask-wearing citizens made their way outside during the global coronavirus pandemic to vote last Tuesday. The rest of the country was seeing Wisconsin’s political dysfunction on display  but Mr. Pfaff has already lived it. “I was surprised how personal it got ” he said  recalling a different fight: The divisions that kept him from being confirmed as the state’s agriculture secretary. “I never wanted it to be like that.” A brutal type of scorched-earth political warfare is flaring in America’s Dairyland. It shows how partisanship pushed to its most strategic outer limits can ensnare not only primary election voters but also cow manure  a Christmas tree  a tourism agency and  in particular  farmers who need help. “The Wisconsin coal mine is knee deep in dead canaries ” said Ben Wikler  the Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman. “Every possible alarm bell about a partisan divide so extreme to be potentially lethal in a literal sense has been rung.” Mr. Pfaff inadvertently became one of those warning bells. Low milk prices and a long global trade war have put farmers in Wisconsin and elsewhere in crisis mode for months — even before a pandemic that produced demand so low that some farmers have dumped their milk. Farms have been going bankrupt at alarming rates  and farmers facing financial ruin have killed themselves. Late last year  11 months after he was first named as agriculture secretary  the Republican-led State Senate voted down Mr. Pfaff’s nomination  effectively firing the Democratic nominee who nearly everyone agreed was amply qualified for the task of helping farmers navigate one of the worst farming crises in decades. “Somebody fired in the middle of a dairy crisis  an agriculture crisis  when he publicly advocated for farmers’ mental health ” said Gov. Tony Evers  a Democrat who was elected by fewer than 30 000 votes  still in disbelief five months later. “God forbid.” Mr. Pfaff did carry out some of his duties last year  while waiting for confirmation. He hosted an Uzbek delegation studying best practices in potato cultivation and crowned Tequila Naomi  a seven-year-old Jersey  as Cow of the Year. He wrote a dozen entries in a blog  saying in one post  “In a time of greater and greater polarization  dairy brings us together.” But even in Wisconsin  America’s Dairyland  where thousands of farmers own more than one million cows  the cows couldn’t overcome partisanship. The political battle in Wisconsin became particularly heated during the tenure of Gov. Scott Walker  who outraged Democrats by taking on a key liberal tenet: organized labor. After he lost the Statehouse in 2018  Wisconsin Republicans  who now control both chambers of the Statehouse  pushed through measures to strip the powers of newly elected Democrats. In November  Republicans opened a special session the governor had called to take up gun control measures — and then pounded the gavel to close the session after only a few seconds. Wisconsin’s capital is surrounded by perfect squares of farmland dotted with red barns and grain silos. Out there  roads are named after farmers because the land has been in the family for so long. “We’re not as Wisconsin nice as we used to be ” said Sachin Chheda  a Democratic consultant based in Milwaukee. “Farms are the badminton shuttlecock being pushed back and forth over the net.” Brian Fraley  a local Republican strategist  said the divisiveness on display in the decision on the agriculture secretary was nearly universal  whatever the topic. Everyone wants to help farmers  but the political climate complicated things. “Society in general is becoming more cynical and abrasive ” he said. “The filters are off and people just express themselves more crudely and quickly. They hit send too easily. The rejection of Brad Pfaff was as much about sending a signal to the governor as it was about his qualifications.” On both sides of the aisle in Wisconsin  the current crisis can seem even more cynical and abrasive. Democrats have argued that pushing forward with the election last Tuesday — after the Republican-dominated Legislature refused to entertain the governor’s request to mail absentee ballots to all voters or reschedule the primary — put voters’ lives at risk. Brian Reisinger  a Republican strategist  said that line of thinking “fires up our base and turns people off.” He argued that Democrats were “focusing on the flash points.” When he was first nominated to be agriculture secretary  it didn’t seem inevitable that Mr. Pfaff  the son of dairy farmers who still pitches in on his parents’ farm on the weekends  would become one of those flash points. “Oh  I loved the job ” he gushed one afternoon. “I knew the seriousness of the situation taking place in the countryside  and I took it very seriously when I traveled and listened and heard what was going on out there.” Even events that were supposed to be fun played against an inescapable backdrop of economic trouble in the industry. In September  Mr. Pfaff traveled to Milk-n-More Farms in Cecil  Wis.  to name Tequila Naomi the state’s Cow of the Year. “Her udder is extremely well attached ” said Nicolle Wussow  who raises Tequila Naomi as she did the cow’s mother  grandmother and great-grandmother on the farm she took over from her parents  Even before the coronavirus crisis  she said  keeping the farm of 100 dairy cows afloat was difficult. “The expenses just don’t go down ” Ms. Wussow said. Across the state all last year  Mr. Pfaff was hearing similar stories. Wisconsin lost 10 percent of its dairy farms in 2019  the largest decline in the state’s history. An agriculture-centric motivational speaker started a lecture circuit. Government statistics reported that the suicide rate was higher than ever; farmer deaths were part of the reason. One farmer carved the number for a suicide hotline in his popular 11-acre corn maze. Phones were ringing at Mr. Pfaff’s agency’s Farm Center  an advice hotline where five workers field calls. Frank Friar  a retired farm loan executive  started answering calls 12 years ago when farmers were mostly seeking help navigating leasing and fencing disputes. Now  they wanted help saving their farms from financial ruin. Mr. Friar remembered picking up the phone in the fall to hear one caller say: “I have a gun. I have it hidden  and I have shells.” The help center was offering farmers who seemed stressed or talked of suicide $100 vouchers they could use in the offices of mental health professionals across the state  a program that had been in place for several years and was paid for through a grant. The vouchers soon became a touchstone in the partisan battle in the Capitol. Several years ago  the center issued few vouchers — only 26 were distributed in 2014. But as the farm economy worsened  the need increased; seven times as many vouchers were issued just last year. One farmer who received vouchers was David Owen  who had been struggling to keep afloat the same farm in Pulaski  Wis.  where he grew up. He knew of farmers nearby facing similar hardships who had committed suicide. “I’m not going to say I wasn’t that far-off ” he said. “I can say it didn’t bother me anymore to die.” Mr. Owen said he and his wife had yet to cash in the vouchers when they decided to auction off their entire herd of 125 Holsteins. The help center says last year it had a 42 percent redemption rate. “Once we made the decision to sell  it got a little easier ” Mr. Owen said. A few days later  just before the auction  he had a heart attack. He earned money this winter doing small carpentry jobs  and on Tuesday he ventured out to vote  casting an all-Republican ballot at the town hall. At the help center  officials had been granted $200 000 for the vouchers and other programs through the state’s budget process. But members of the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee had yet to officially release the money to the center and cash was running low. A fight over information on the program’s effectiveness ensued. “What we were trying to do is be helpful to the agency and helpful to farmers who needed help ” said Representative Joan Ballweg  a Republican who is co-chairwoman of a task force on suicide prevention. As lawmakers fought  Mr. Pfaff said he thought back to the frosty morning a year ago when he stood outside a giant dairy barn and marveled at the wreckage from an ice storm. Heaps of snow had crumpled the roof. Animals were wounded  or worse. “I saw dead cows stacked up like cordwood ” Mr. Pfaff said. Helplessness was all he felt that day  especially when he saw a teenager hop down from his tractor to join his father surveying the tattered farm that had been in the same family for generations. That boy might never inherit the family farm  Mr. Pfaff thought. Only $500 was left in the mental health fund  enough for five vouchers. He couldn’t stay quiet. “If the Joint Finance Committee doesn’t want to move this funding forward immediately  then they have a choice to make: Which five farmers will it be?” Mr. Pfaff complained publicly. Republicans were outraged at the suggestion their inaction was hurting farmers. The Republican Senate majority leader  Scott Fitzgerald  fired off a letter to Mr. Pfaff  calling his comments “offensive and unproductive.” Republicans began rallying against Mr. Pfaff. A legislative committee at the start of the year had unanimously voted to support his nomination for agriculture secretary  but Mr. Pfaff had yet to be confirmed by the entire Senate. Rumors buzzed that Republicans might vote to reject him. The governor quickly scrambled to save his nominee. He held private meetings with Republican senators. They were not swayed. He hosted a euchre party at the governor’s mansion. One Republican showed up. The day of the vote on his position  Mr. Pfaff knew what was coming. He holed up in his office and ignored the action on the Senate floor. Mr. Evers doubled down  causing a stir by taking a seat in the public gallery of the Senate  an extraordinary move for a sitting governor. One after another  Democratic senators stood to defend Mr. Pfaff. They noted his record helping farmers as the Wisconsin executive director of the Farm Service Agency under President Barack Obama. He was in 4-H as a youth  they said. Farming was in his DNA. He bleeds manure  one senator said. From behind the lectern  Mr. Fitzgerald  the majority leader  said he had warned the governor that he didn’t have enough votes for Mr. Pfaff’s nomination to succeed. The governor could have withdrawn the nomination and spared an embarrassing vote. Frustrated with the situation  Jennifer Shilling  the Senate minority leader  said  “We need statesmen and women to figure out a way that we de-escalate this legislative nuclear war that we are in.” The votes were counted  and Mr. Pfaff’s nomination was defeated. It was the first time since at least 1987 that the Senate had turned down a cabinet nominee. The governor swore in anger. He appointed a new agriculture secretary. Mr. Pfaff got a job at the State Department of Administration  as director of business and rural development. Mr. Pfaff cast his ballot early a few weeks ago  before Republicans had asked for an exception to the governor’s stay-at-home orders so citizens could golf and hold Easter services. He didn’t have to venture out Tuesday into what was the culmination of recent partisan bickering — voters lining up during a pandemic. But Mr. Pfaff recently learned a seat in his district came open in the State Senate. He is considering a candidacy. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/us/politics/00Wisconsin-divide1/merlin_166525206_30f041df-e7f4-41dc-91b4-55047faa15f2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-dionne-searcey/author-dionne-searcey-thumbLarge-v2.png

Dua Lipa found herself releasing an upbeat dance-pop album during a global crisis. But fans embraced the opportunity to find escape.Credit...Charlie Gates for The New York Times Supported by By Caryn Ganz Dua Lipa looked away from the camera and covered her face with a manicured hand. “I really didn’t want to do this ” she half-whispered. She failed to muffle a major sniffle. It was shortly after 10 a.m. Monday of the last full week in March  and the usually composed 24-year-old English pop star was not on her way to New York to rehearse for her scheduled appearance on “Saturday Night Live” that coming weekend. She was not at a photo shoot  in a radio studio or any of the other places an artist preparing to release her much-anticipated second album might be. She was in coronavirus self-quarantine in London  addressing her fans live on Instagram for only the second time. “I’ve been a little bit conflicted about putting music out and you know  whether it’s the right thing to do during this time because lots of people are suffering ” she had explained as she teared up. The album was due in 11 days. Lipa quickly composed herself and spoke about how she had avoided focusing on the pressures that come with making a buzzed-about second album — like the specter of the sophomore slump  a fate that could extinguish a budding career — by assembling a dancey  upbeat LP that made her feel good. She hoped that the album  “Future Nostalgia ” would bring her fans a bit of joy at a very uncertain time. Oh  and it would now be out in four days. Pop album launches are like Fourth of July fireworks shows: highly choreographed affairs with dozens of carefully timed parts threatening to detonate at any moment. For a powerhouse young artist like Lipa  a flawlessly executed second album could determine whether she’d secure her path to career stardom  like Katy Perry or Lady Gaga  or join the ranks of hopefuls whose fame slipped away. After teeing up “Future Nostalgia” with years of preparation — built on the success of her 2017 platinum debut album  six platinum singles and hundreds of performances around the globe — Lipa and her team suddenly realized a few cannons hadn’t simply misfired; their entire barge was in danger of sinking. The giant Glastonbury festival was out. The 85-date arena tour had to be rescheduled. They debated pushing the record back to the summer; then two days before Lipa’s raw live stream  “Future Nostalgia” leaked  which she took as a sign to act immediately — she’s been a planner all her life  and wanted to feel like she had wrestled something back under her control. It became clear that Lipa and her core crew would be releasing one of the year’s biggest pop records from their couches. (A day later  Lady Gaga announced that she was delaying her new album  “Chromatica.” Sam Smith soon did the same.) “When I was coming to the end of my first record and I was going into interviews  I would tell people that I want my next record to be like an organized mess ” Lipa said a few hours later on a FaceTime call  her bleached hair secured by two barrettes like a ’90s alt-rocker. “And then everything just got spun around and I was like  what happened to my organized mess?” Her tears had dried  but were hovering in an emotional on-deck circle. “I’d be lying if I wasn’t welling up like 10 times a day just from what is happening ” she said. It was easy for her thoughts to slip into a “downward spiral” of virus-related fears: whether grandparents would be safe  and everyone would have enough food. Nobody expected to be having this conversation. Lipa certainly didn’t anticipate a pandemic becoming part of the “Future Nostalgia” narrative. But here we were. Fans were turning snippets from her singles into quarantine memes: the “I should’ve stayed at home” chorus from “Break My Heart”; the “Don’t show up/Don’t come out” refrain from “Don’t Start Now.” The memes  she loved. Appearing on a live stream  not so much. The only other time Lipa had gone live on social media was in December 2018  when she celebrated her two Grammy nominations by chugging from a bottle of Champagne. “It came out of my nose and it was all kinds of disgusting ” she said. “Obviously now during this time I’m probably going to do more live videos. So that’s another thing out of my comfort zone that I might get really good at.” She let out a resigned laugh. Before the coronavirus swallowed daily life for much of the world  the “Future Nostalgia” rollout was humming along. Lipa had plenty of momentum from her self-titled 2017 debut  a mash-up of tempos and pop-R&B vibes that included the blockbuster “New Rules ” a song enumerating how to avoid backsliding with an ex  which seemed to play on the radio every time a woman considered the idea. (Its YouTube video alone has 2 billion views.) Lipa won those two Grammys  including one for best new artist  performed at the show alongside St. Vincent  and made sure to acknowledge the other women nominees in a pointedly feminist acceptance speech. Wendy Williams mispronounced her name on her TV show  giving Lipa an internet nickname: Dula Peep. Her Instagram following swelled to more than 40 million. The new album’s first single  “Don’t Start Now ” dropped like a disco ball in fall 2019  serving up ’70s roller-rink-jam touchstones: a rubber-band bass line reminiscent of Chic and choppy synth strings  topped by Lipa’s nimble  husky vocals. “Physical” followed  adding a dash of Olivia Newton-John aerobics-pop to the mix  then “Break My Heart ” more finger-wagging glitter funk with a chorus that interpolates the rhythm guitar from INXS’s “Need You Tonight.” Lipa wanted the album to have a cohesive dance-pop aesthetic  and it showed. That meant she had to shut out other people’s opinions  “Because I knew I would be stuck in a studio trying to make another ‘New Rules ’” she said. “That’s a vicious cycle where I don’t grow and nobody else benefits from that because it’s just the same song again and again  and I just don’t want to.” Katy Perry well understands the drive to carve out fresh creative paths in an industry that prefers the security of sameness. “We have kind of an unspoken sisterly bond ” she said by phone of Lipa  whom she sees as part of a generation of young musicians — including Billie Eilish  Rosalía and Lizzo — on the career-artist track. “You have to be able to evolve under the spotlight  not let the pressure get to you  not let the comments get to you ” Perry said. “These songs are going to have legs after this quarantine.” Lipa had a strategy to make sure she didn’t lose sight of her goal. She returned to trusted collaborators — Clarence Coffee Jr.  Sarah Hudson  Koz — hoping to capture the lighthearted spirit of making the new album in its tracks. The title came to her first  a cue to touch on the music she heard in the house growing up: Prince  Blondie  Jamiroquai  the electro duo Moloko  and of course  Madonna. (Stuart Price  who oversaw Madonna’s 2005 disco opus “Confessions on a Dance Floor ” contributed production on three “Future Nostalgia” tracks. Lipa’s LP likewise has no ballads.) “Going in with an artist that has a vision and is really adamant about what they hear and what they want  it’s like  you can’t ask for anything better than that ” said Hudson  a Los Angeles songwriter who worked on “Physical” and “Levitating ” the groovy track that helped Lipa unlock her blueprint for the LP. The “Levitating” session involved a doughnut binge that had the crew bouncing off the walls; the lyrics include the term of endearment “my sugarboo.” While Lipa has been a queen of the kiss-off — she prefers music for “dance-crying ” songs that traverse darker emotional terrain — “Future Nostalgia” is stocked with tracks about the thrill of a happy relationship. She’s been dating the model Anwar Hadid since summer 2019 and the new work puts her in the company of other young women who talk frankly about sexuality in their music. “It’s really the way I express myself  and the way that I would talk with my friends and the way that I am ” she said. Hudson stressed that Lipa was an integral part of the songwriting process  a fact that has sometimes been obscured by the public’s focus on the onetime model’s looks and personal life. Another under-heralded talent is Lipa’s ability to nail complex syncopations and wordy passages on and around the beat  perhaps owing to her early hip-hop fandom growing up in London  then Kosovo. (Her first concert was Method Man and Redman. Her second was 50 Cent.) “She’s so genuine and she’s so just who she is and relatable  but at the same time she’s a superstar ” Hudson said. “She just walks in the room and you’re like  Oh my God.” There’s a difference between being comfortable onstage or in front of a fashion photographer’s lens and figuring out how to frame yourself best on a laptop’s dinky camera. In the four days between announcing her album’s new release date and its arrival  Lipa became her own glam squad  stylist  cinematographer  I.T. department and broadcast center. “We knew promo was going to be very hard if not impossible ” her manager  Ben Mawson  said by phone from London. Billboards  usually a major element of marketing campaigns  are “kind of pointless right now because no one’s going outside.” Digital initiatives  like a track-by-track breakdown on YouTube  took on fresh importance. Dua Lipa loves a plan. When she was a child  her father would find to-do notes she’d written for herself lying around the house: wake up  have breakfast  finish homework. She’s the organizer in her friend group — the one making the dinner reservations and corralling everyone to the comedy club. So she quickly adapted to her new normal: a home office. “I’ve never used my laptop more than I have right now ” she said. “I’ve been downloading multiple apps to do lots of different phone calls and meet-ups.” It was a major change of pace; Lipa is the type who eschews airplane Wi-Fi so she can read a book. And then there was the question of the sizable beauty industrial complex that goes into making a pop star look like a pop star. “Normally when I’d go and do promo of course  I’d have my hair and my makeup done  whereas now I have one trusty brown lipstick ” Lipa said. “I put face cream  and that is it for the day.” (She did her own hair and makeup for this article’s socially distanced photo shoot.) The upsides were already evident: “It just shows a very unfiltered version of yourself ” she said. Plus  “My time in bed is much longer.” There was yet another curveball: Lipa wasn’t even in her own home. She had returned from a trip overseas to a flooded apartment  and quickly secured a small Airbnb for the quarantine. She and Hadid got comfortable fast  making banana jerky and watching crime dramas. She conducted radio interviews  filmed a Zoom-style performance of “Don’t Start Now” for James Corden — with 11 band mates and backup dancers doing their parts in their homes — and appeared on Miley Cyrus’s “Bright Minded” live stream interview series  all from different perches in the rental. When we spoke again later that week  on Friday  a handwritten note tucked into a vase over her shoulder was visible on camera: “No smoking until 5 pm 4 your own health!” “This is my boyfriend’s note to himself ” she said  laughing  once it was pointed out. “Because I have a bit more willpower.” Nobody who comes into contact with Dua Lipa has ever questioned her drive. She credits her work ethic to her parents  Albanian immigrants who both held two jobs while going to university when she was growing up. “My parents sacrificed a lot to try and make me feel like I wasn’t missing out on anything ” she said. Her name set her apart at school  but she didn’t feel like an outsider. When she was 11  the family returned to Pristina  the capital of Kosovo  and though their quality of life improved  Lipa realized she “didn’t have the opportunities that I did in London.” She begged to go back; when she was 15  her parents eventually relented  and let her move in with a family friend’s daughter. (How did she convince them? “My dad just says I’m very hard to say no to.” In 2018 she helped put on a music festival in Kosovo with her father  who plays in a rock band.) Lipa took a gap year after finishing school and resolved to find a manager. She had no idea how to do that. She worked at a restaurant and partied — “It was a fun time for sure ” she said — but stayed focused. She posted cover songs on SoundCloud and YouTube  dropped off demo CDs at radio stations and picked up gigs doing vocals for advertisements. One such assignment  for an “X Factor” commercial  connected her with a producer who proposed a publishing deal. Lipa was 17 and flummoxed  and reached out to a producer named Felix Joseph she’d befriended online. “I was like  I know we’ve never met and we only know each other from Twitter  but I’ve just been offered a publishing deal and I have no idea what the [expletive] it means.” It was a fortunate connection: Joseph redirected her to his attorney  who nixed the deal but was impressed enough to set up a meeting with Mawson. “She came into our office and the first thing that struck me was just how incredibly charismatic she was ” said Mawson  who also manages Lana Del Rey. “She had bags of ambition  and she played us little bits of demos and the voice was just amazing.” He asked her what kind of career she wanted; when Lipa referenced Madonna  he was sold. Lipa said she didn’t quit her day job at La Bodega Negra until she’d signed her record deal with Warner Bros. She had celebratory cocktails at the restaurant with her team first. She and Mawson have been dreaming — or planning  rather — big since Day 1  with an eye on a global prize. “On the first album  she did 245 live shows ” Mawson said. “For a pop act  that’s not normal.” (Lipa has the number tattooed on her arm.) The total included concerts far from England and the United States; Mexico City and São Paulo are currently her two biggest cities on Spotify. “She’s put in the time and she cares about countries which are difficult to make a mark in ” Mawson said. He cited China  which “was challenging.” She visited three times promoting “Dua Lipa.” The strategy would end up buoying Lipa during the first week of the “Future Nostalgia” release. She lost No. 1 on the British charts to 5 Seconds of Summer and debuted in the United States at No. 4  behind the Weeknd  5 Seconds of Summer and Lil Uzi Vert. But on Spotify  she was the most listened to female artist and third most-streamed artist in the world. “I think that you should feel totally confident with your choice of putting out the record because you can bring  like  a lot of light ” Miley Cyrus had told Lipa during their live interview. “I need a [expletive] dance party.” If Lipa had spent her release week worrying about unleashing a feel-good album in the midst of a crisis  when the LP arrived on March 27 accompanied by glowing reviews and Instagram comments filled with hearts and fire emojis  the anxiety had faded. “Today is a very good day ” she said  beaming in her Airbnb. “I’m so overwhelmed with the response and how lovely everyone’s been.” As she’d hoped  fans said the album’s bouncy vibe had provided them with a much-needed escape. She was sporting the Christopher Kane “Techno Sexual” sweatshirt she’d worn on a live stream a few days prior. (Quarantined stars: They really are just like us.) Before she’d known how her decision would play out  she had shared a rare moment of self-doubt. “A week before I was about to release ‘Don’t Start Now’ I started panicking ” she said  “because it was the first time I was like  [expletive]  I haven’t asked or checked or seen if anybody even wants something like this.” Mawson recounted a similar tale of the song’s arrival. He knew Lipa had made something that was “uniquely her ” but fretted to his radio promotion executive that the almost Eurodisco track didn’t sound like the songs in heavy rotation on American radio. “He was like  yeah  it isn’t what’s getting played  but I believe this is the kind of song that could change the radio ” Mawson said. “And look at it now  it’s beating ‘New Rules.’” It was a lesson that would prove useful over the course of Lipa’s highly unusual week: Some things just can’t be planned.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/sandra-lee-cooking-coronavirus.html, style, Sandra Lee Has Her Own Message for America, , The former “first girlfriend” of New York wants to teach the homebound how to subsist on affordable staples. Sandra Lee and Phoenix  her pet cockatoo.Credit...Buck Ellison for The New York Times Supported by By Jessica Bennett Sandra Lee was horrified by the contents of my pantry. “Girl  you’re in trouble ” she said  after demanding that I send her photos of every shelf. “What I love the most is how many beans you have ” she said. (I’m allergic  which is probably why they’re still there.) But Ms. Lee  the former Food Network personality and cookbook author  is the queen of making something out of nothing  and assured me she would find a way out of my cupboard quandary. After all  she built a brand on “semi-homemade” recipes that rely on affordable  store-bought products — the same ones we are now dusting off and defrosting in the face of a global pandemic. Ms. Lee  53  recalled a time when she and her former partner  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York  were watching football at their home in Westchester County during a snowstorm. There was nothing in the fridge  so she insisted they go out. “He looked at me and he said  ‘You’re Sandra Lee. Just go whip something up ’” she said. She made garlic knots. Her present circumstances are a bit different. She is in Los Angeles now  under shelter-in-place orders  so going out isn’t as viable an option. She is also caring for her ailing aunt and uncle  helping to direct shipments of ventilators and other supplies to New York  coordinating with a girlfriend who runs an animal shelter in which she is a partner  and filming a new cooking series for the “Today” show from her kitchen. Keeping busy has helped her structure her days somewhat in a time when time itself can feel boundless. “You know  nobody has a daily routine right now ” Ms. Lee said. “I get up and I see what the latest news is. Of course I watch Andrew live” — on the governor’s daily coronavirus briefings  which have drawn a captive audience — “and then share with him my thoughts.” She said she and Mr. Cuomo still communicate nearly every day. (The governor was unavailable for comment. In a statement sent through his office shortly after publication  a spokesperson said: “The Governor wishes her well in her next endeavor and we’re sure it will be a success.”) Ms. Lee’s companion at home is a majestic white cockatoo named Phoenix  a gift from Mr. Cuomo when they were still a couple. “He’s getting bored ” she said of the bird. His main preoccupation these days has been chewing on wooden clothespins. Humans  at least  can cook to pass the time  and Ms. Lee would like to show them how. Her new series is called “Top Shelf ” which  to be clear  isn’t about fancy ingredients. “Nobody’s eating Wagyu ” she said. Rather  it’s that stuff some Americans may have forgotten about in their pantries  practically unreachable  waiting for the end times that seemed to arrive all at once just weeks ago. In a sense  Ms. Lee is the perfect guide for this moment. She will change the way you think about a package of $2 Peeps (they can be used on cakes  to garnish cocktails or hidden in eggs in the garden)  explain that if you separate two-ply toilet paper into single ply it lasts twice as long and pour you a heavy vodka and fresh grapefruit when it’s all over  which is what she was drinking during one of our calls. (Pro tip from Aunt Sandy  as she often calls herself: If you chop the used grapefruit into fourths  you can throw a chunk of it down the garbage disposal and toss another in the bottom of your trash can. “They keep everything fresh ” she said.) “She loves to problem-solve  so she’s a great person to call when the stuff hits the fan ” her longtime friend Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton  a dermatologist in Manhattan  said over the phone this week. Sandra Lee grew up on food stamps  bouncing between homes after her mother dropped her and a younger sister off at her grandmother’s house when Sandra was 2 and didn’t return for several years. She learned to be creative with cooking in part to stretch her family’s welfare checks and help care for three more siblings who arrived. “We made simple bargain cuisine  not because we wanted to  but because we had to ” she wrote in her 2007 memoir  “Made From Scratch.” Eventually  Ms. Lee turned that thriftiness into a business: first with a curtain line started in the bedroom of her aunt and uncle’s house and later with a QVC show  and eventually  a cooking empire. Her first show on Food Network  “Semi-Homemade Cooking ” ran for 15 seasons  showcasing recipes that were accessible  attainable and affordable  using 70 percent store-bought ingredients and 30 percent homemade. When the recession hit  in 2008  Ms. Lee introduced a second show  “Money Saving Meals ” which taught parents how to feed a family of four for $4. (Leftovers were called “round two” recipes.) “I mean  the beautiful thing about being raised Jehovah’s Witness is always in the back of your mind  Armageddon is coming ” Ms. Lee said of her childhood  in which her mother became a follower of the millenarian Christian movement. “So your pantry’s always stocked.” (Ms. Lee converted to Judaism when she married Bruce Karatz  a businessman  in 2001  but has since returned to Christianity.) In more recent years  Ms. Lee  whose 25 cookbooks have sold more than a million copies  has maintained a relatively low profile. As New York’s “first girlfriend” (which made Phoenix the “first first bird ” she said) she rarely appeared at political events and managed to keep her family affairs private  though friends say she was often working behind the scenes. “People always call her Dolley Madison because she was sort of behind the scenes orchestrating ” said Dr. Ingleton  alluding to the wife of President James Madison  who was known for her social and political talents. “She and Andrew accomplished a lot together ” said a sister  Kimber Lee  noting that she had been an advocate for marriage equality and the legalization of medical marijuana. In 2015  Ms. Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer and opted for a double mastectomy. She chronicled the experience in the 2018 documentary “Rx: Early Detection  A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee ” and became an outspoken proponent of early cancer screening. (She said that she remains  thankfully  cancer-free.) Ms. Lee and Mr. Cuomo announced their split in September  after 14 years together  but remain close. (“He’s still my guy ” she said. “Neither one of us  well as far as I know  has had a date.”) She has a good relationship with his daughters  and has been directing prospective donors of P.P.E. and hand sanitizer to 25-year-old Cara  who is helping her father with relief coordination. “They’re my family  and they always will be my family ” Ms. Lee said. “We share a home  we share children  we share friendship ” she said of Mr. Cuomo. “I will protect him and be there for him until the day I die.” Ms. Lee was long Mr. Cuomo’s defender when New Yorkers on both sides of the political aisle were critical of his record. But these days  many have warmed to him as a leader  and in sometimes surprising ways. Last week a theory spread across the internet about a photo of the governor in which … something could be discerned beneath his white polo shirt. “A nipple ring? What did you just say?” Ms. Lee said  eyes wide. Later she appeared in a video on Facebook alluding to “nonsense” online and telling body-shamers to “knock it off!” There have  and always will be  Sandra Lee detractors  including those who have scoffed at her use of artificial ingredients as well as her particular combinations of them. “It is difficult to understand how a responsible author could choose a tasteless  industrial cheese like Velveeta to prepare what she calls ‘gourmet-tasting’ food ” wrote the former New York Times food writer Amanda Hesser as Ms. Lee prepared to release her second cookbook. Anthony Bourdain famously called her “Kwanzaa cake ” which called for angel food cake  vanilla frosting  popcorn and corn nuts  a “crime against humanity.” “I’m not sure that some of the food purists are in touch with what really goes on in American households ” Ms. Lee told The Times in 2012. And indeed  we are living in a new world now  one in which more than 16 million Americans have filed for unemployment and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends having at least two weeks worth of food at home. These days  Ina Garten is making oversize quarantine cocktails. Food Network is offering quarantine recipes  and Americans are flocking to familiar processed foods  like SpaghettiOs  Spam and Cheetos. Even Mr. Cuomo is delivering lengthy monologues about the comfort of spaghetti and meatballs. “I think there’s been an immediate shift for all of us in what we think of as ‘enough ’” said Samin Nosrat  the food writer and Netflix host  who recently created a podcast about how to cook with what’s in your pantry. Ms. Nosrat  the author of “Salt Fat Acid Heat” (and an occasional New York Times contributor)  said she has noticed herself become much more conscientious about rationing  and less snobby about  say  which brand of canned tomatoes she chooses. “I’m first to admit  I always denigrated that style of cooking ” she said of Ms. Lee’s brand of prepackaged goods. “But I have to say  doing everything from scratch in these circumstances is bananas.” Ms. Lee said that  right now  food is about survival  not luxury. “I think you just have to figure out how to do with what you have and how to make it the best you can ” she said. “You have to see what’s there  not what’s not there.” In her own home  what’s there is cans of cream of celery  cream of mushroom  cream of potato: “great bases for anything you want and they all last forever ” she said. There is also popcorn  nuts  stacks on stacks of tomato sauces  a variety of canned soups. “I like chicken noodle soup just because I like it  and I like it with saltines  especially when I don’t feel well ” she said  pointing to the saltines. There are artichokes. “My favorite  my favorite thing ” she said. Pasta  vegetable stock  Bisquick  Red Lobster brand cheddar biscuit mix. “I only have that because my aunt loves it ” she said. And she is well-stocked for Easter  with chocolate bunnies  toy bunnies  marshmallow bunnies  bunny cookies  jelly beans  licorice  fresh-cut lilies  and of course a whole ham  which she plans to roast for dinner. The ham leftovers  she said  she will make into a “decadent  cheesy casserole” — a perfect round two recipe.

Being influential is the whole business., Supported by TikTok stars aren’t going to Hollywood for film and TV careers. Being influential is the whole business. By Taylor Lorenz Addison Easterling  a 19-year-old TikTok star with more than 30.6 million followers  had never shot an acting reel or auditioned for a big role. But after finding huge success on TikTok  which she joined just last summer  top talent agents in Los Angeles began to reach out. In December  she moved from Baton Rouge  La.  to Los Angeles. In January  she signed with William Morris Endeavor  a major Hollywood talent agency. “When WME said they wanted to sign me  I couldn’t wrap my head around it ” she said. “Just the opportunity to talk with one of these big agencies is a big deal.” “This all came out of something I did for fun ” she said. “I was like  ‘Is this a real thing?’” For those in entertainment  signing with an elite talent agency has long been a status symbol. But the fame landscape is shifting  and big agencies have realigned their businesses to focus on a new generation of talent: influencers. “The next wave of talent  all future waves of talent  aren’t going to come from traditional places ” said Jad Dayeh  co-head of digital at WME. “The younger generation creates  self-broadcasts and shares it with the world. They don’t wait to get their audition shot and wait for someone to discover them.” “It used to be  I want to get famous on YouTube or Vine  so I can have a career in traditional entertainment. Now  this is a career ” said Greg Goodfried  co-head of digital talent at United Talent Agency. Because they grew their audience organically  many Gen Z stars don’t need agents to help them get gigs. But  as Parker Pannell  a 16-year-old TikToker  put it: “It’s a major flex to tell your friends you’re with CAA  WME or UTA.” Digital talent departments at many large agencies aren’t new  but the money pouring into the space has exploded in recent years. The influencer marketing industry is set to top more than $15 billion by 2022  up from nearly $8 billion in 2019  according to a 2019 research report by Business Insider Intelligence using data from Mediakix. This  of course  could change with the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Still  those figures don’t even capture many of the successful products and businesses influencers have launched  including makeup and clothing lines. It used to be that digital talent agents were ancillary to the business of big agencies  Mr. Dayeh said. But “in the last two years  digital has become the primary touchpoint for talent with the public.” To that point  when Brent Weinstein of UTA launched the agency’s digital arm in 2006  initially called UTA Online  he was scouring YouTube and other web platforms for obscure talent. Today  he is the UTA’s chief innovation officer. Other big talent houses had digital media divisions in the early aughts  too. But at the time  most agencies were focused on bringing celebrities from traditional Hollywood onto then-new platforms like Twitter  rather than building businesses around the ever-growing number of internet-native stars. “There wasn’t a lot of money going around  it was really early days ” said Alec Shankman  a comanaging partner at A3 Artists Agency  formerly known as Abrams. Now  the dozens of TikTokers the agency has signed  Mr. Shankman said  have “become a really important part of our business.” That’s partially because influencers are often successful at generating the thing agencies care most about: cash. “Frankly  we’re in a very for-profit business ” said Andrew Graham  an agent in Creative Artists Agency’s digital department. “So when brands started calling and saying  ‘Hey  do you have an influencer for this campaign?’ the agency’s ears perked up.” To get deals for their clients  digital agents must remain current on technology shifts and the ever-evolving ways to structure deals. These include merch drops that never see a retail store; business decisions vetted by Instagram followers; meet-and-greets via FaceTime; and an endless churn of new digital platforms. “It’s the Wild West ” said Alison Berman  co-head of digital talent at UTA. “There are some templates in place for some of the deals we do  but our area of business certainly isn’t templatized.” Literary and film departments have “unions that are setting rates” and “there’s certain deals broken up into certain payment schedules ” she said. “They’re plug and play  whereas ours are entrepreneurial and we’re pioneering it as we go.” In practice  it means that the big agencies have to keep up with the breakneck pace of their young clients  and woo them in new ways too. Cosette Rinab  a 20-year-old TikToker  said that seeing UTA sign a major TikTok star like Charli D’Amelio (who signed along with the rest of her family) gave her respect for the agency. (Other members of the Hype House  a TikTok star collective  have signed with WME and A3 Artists Agency.) “In my eyes  it gave UTA a little bit more relevance ” Ms. Rinab said. “It gave me a feeling of  ‘Oh  UTA is really keeping up with this.’” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/fashion/13influenceragents1/merlin_169057920_f11f6abf-c650-494f-94b7-ab40d28447b2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/18/reader-center/author-taylor-lorenz/author-taylor-lorenz-thumbLarge.png 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/coronavirus-vaccine-nationalism.html, business, A New Front for Nationalism: The Global Battle Against a Virus, , Every country needs the same lifesaving tools. But a zero-sum mind-set among world leaders is jeopardizing access for all. Credit...Max Guther Supported by By Peter S. Goodman  Katie Thomas  Sui-Lee Wee and Jeffrey Gettleman As they battle a pandemic that has no regard for borders  the leaders of many of the world’s largest economies are in the thrall of unabashedly nationalist principles  undermining collective efforts to tame the novel coronavirus. The United States  an unrivaled scientific power  is led by a president who openly scoffs at international cooperation while pursuing a global trade war. India  which produces staggering amounts of drugs  is ruled by a Hindu nationalist who has ratcheted up confrontation with neighbors. China  a dominant source of protective gear and medicines  is bent on a mission to restore its former imperial glory. Now  just as the world requires collaboration to defeat the coronavirus — scientists joining forces across borders to create vaccines  and manufacturers coordinating to deliver critical supplies — national interests are winning out. This time  the contest is over far more than which countries will make iPads or even advanced jets. This is a battle for supremacy over products that may determine who lives and who dies. At least 69 countries have banned or restricted the export of protective equipment  medical devices or medicines  according to the Global Trade Alert project at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The World Health Organization is warning that protectionism could limit the global availability of vaccines. With every country on the planet in need of the same lifesaving tools at once  national rivalries are jeopardizing access for all. “The parties with the deepest pockets will secure these vaccines and medicines  and essentially  much of the developing world will be entirely out of the picture ” said Simon J. Evenett  an expert on international trade who started the University of St. Gallen project. “We will have rationing by price. It will be brutal.” Some point to the tragedy playing out around the world as an argument for greater self sufficiency  so that hospitals are less reliant on China and India for medicines and protective gear. China alone makes the vast majority of the core chemicals used to make raw materials for a range of generic medicines used to treat people now hospitalized with Covid-19  said Rosemary Gibson  a health care expert at the Hastings Center  an independent research institution in New York. These include antibiotics  blood pressure treatments and sedatives. “Everyone is competing for a supply located in a single country ” Ms. Gibson said. But if the laudable goal of diversification inspires every nation to look inward and dismantle global production  that will leave the world even more vulnerable  said Chad P. Bown  an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. President Trump and his leading trade adviser  Peter Navarro  have exploited the pandemic as an opportunity to redouble efforts to force multinational companies to abandon China and shift production to the United States. Mr. Navarro has proposed rules that would force American health care providers to buy protective gear and medicines from U.S. suppliers. “We just don’t have the production capacity ” Mr. Bown said  noting that Chinese industry is restarting  while American factories remain disrupted. “Just as you don’t want to be too dependent on China  you don’t want to be too dependent on yourself. You have now walled yourself off from the only way you can potentially deal with this  in your time of greatest need  which is relying on the rest of the world.” For seven decades after World War II  the notion that global trade enhances security and prosperity prevailed across major economies. When people exchange goods across borders  the logic goes  they become less likely to take up arms. Consumers gain better and cheaper products. Competition and collaboration spur innovation. But in many countries — especially the United States — a stark failure by governments to equitably distribute the bounty has undermined faith in trade  giving way to a protectionist mentality in which goods and resources are viewed as zero-sum. Now  the zero-sum perspective is a guiding force just as the sum in question is alarmingly limited: Potentially vital supplies of medicine are in short supply  exacerbating antagonism and distrust. Last week  the Trump administration cited a Korean War-era law to justify banning exports of protective masks made in the United States  while ordering American companies that produce such wares overseas to redirect orders to their home market. One American company  3M  said halting planned shipments of masks overseas would imperil health workers in Canada and Latin America. On Monday  3M said it struck a compromise with the government that will send some masks to the United States and some overseas. In recent weeks  Turkey  Ukraine  Thailand  Taiwan  Indonesia  Bangladesh  Pakistan  South Africa and Ecuador have all banned the export of protective masks. France and Germany imposed bans on masks and other protective gear  lifting them only after the European Union barred exports outside the bloc. India banned exports of respirators and disinfectants. Britain has prohibited exports of hydroxychloroquine  an anti-malarial drug now being tested for potential benefits against the virus. Hungary has banned exports of the raw material for that drug and medicines that contain it. “The export bans are not helpful ” said Mariangela Simao  assistant director general for medicines and health products at the World Health Organization in Geneva. “It can disrupt supply chains of some products that are actually needed everywhere.” President Trump has been especially aggressive in securing an American stockpile of hydroxychloroquine  disregarding the counsel of federal scientists who have warned that testing remains minimal  with scant evidence of benefits. India is the world’s largest producer of hydroxychloroquine. Last month  the government banned exports of the drug  though it stipulated that shipments could continue under limited circumstances. “In this situation  each country has to take care of itself ” said Satish Kumar  an adjunct professor at the International Institute of Health Management Research in New Delhi. “If we are not able to take care of our population  it will be a very critical situation.” After Mr. Trump demanded that India lift the export restrictions on Monday night while threatening retaliation  the government appeared to soften its position. “In view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic ” said India’s foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava  the government would allow exports “to some nations who have been particularly badly affected” — an apparent nod to the United States. Arithmetic suggested that a policy of stockpiling for national needs might leave other countries short. India is likely to require 56 metric tons  but now has only 38 metric tons  said Udaya Bhaskar  director general of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India  an industry body set up by the government to promote exports of Indian medicines. One manufacturer  Watson Pharma  owned by Teva Pharmaceuticals and based in the western Indian state of Goa  was seeking to triple its production of hydroxychloroquine over the next two weeks. As global pharmaceutical companies explore new forms of treatment for the coronavirus — a complex undertaking even under ideal laboratory conditions — they are having to navigate an additional layer of real-world intricacy: geopolitics. Companies steeped in genomics and the rigorous demands of manufacturing must find a way to develop new drugs  begin commercial production and also anticipate how the predilections of nationalists running major economies may limit supplies. One of the most closely watched drugs  remdesivir  is made by Gilead  an American company. Though clinical trials have not yet been completed  the company has been ramping up manufacturing to meet global demand in advance of the drug’s approval. Like many newer drugs  remdesivir’s formula includes “novel substances with limited global availability ” according to a statement on the company’s website. Gilead is increasing production in part by expanding beyond its own facilities in the United States  contracting with plants in Europe and Asia  in a move that appeared to hedge its bets against trouble in any one place. “The international nature of the supply chain for remdesivir reminds us that it is essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for the world ” said Daniel O’Day  Gilead’s chairman and chief executive  in an April 4 statement. Gilead says it has enough of the drug to treat 30 000 patients  while aiming to amass enough to treat one million by the end of the year. But outside experts questioned whether that would be sufficient. “There is going to be a real fight over the allocation of the remdesivir supply if indeed it proves effective ” said Geoffrey Porges  an analyst for SVB Leerink  an investment bank in Boston. Another drugmaker  the New York-based Regeneron  is preparing a U.S. plant to produce a cocktail of antibodies developed in genetically engineered mice  with tests planned for hospitalized patients and as a preventative treatment. A similar antibody cocktail proved effective against Ebola. The company is planning the extraordinary action of shifting the production of some of its most profitable drugs — one that treats eczema  another for eyes — to a factory in Ireland to make room for the experimental treatment. Regeneron’s chief executive  Dr. Leonard Schleifer  said the decision to make the new drug cocktail in the United States was both geopolitical and practical. “You want to make it close to where the need is  and we anticipate there will be great need in the United States ” he said. He acknowledged that making products overseas now posed risks that they could be subject to export bans in that country. In addition  Regeneron is receiving federal funds to expand its manufacturing of the vaccine  which carries the expectation that the company will prioritize the American market. “It just made good sense to us to do this in the United States ” Dr. Schleifer said. China has seized on the pandemic as an opportunity to present itself as a responsible world citizen  in contrast to Western democracies that failed to reckon with the threat — not least the United States  now the epicenter of the outbreak. Ever since President Trump took office  unleashing tariffs on friends and foes alike  China’s paramount leader  Xi Jinping  has sought to exploit the American abdication of global leadership as a chance to crown himself champion of the rules-based trading system. Given that China is ruled by an unelected Communist Party that subsidizes state-owned companies and tolerates the widespread theft of intellectual property  those claims have strained credulity. China’s reputation has also suffered as it pursues its Belt and Road Initiative  a $1 trillion collection of infrastructure projects stretching from East Asia to Europe and Africa that has been engineered to spread Beijing’s influence and generate business for Chinese companies. Some recipients of Chinese credit have come to see the terms as predatory  prompting accusations that China is an ascendant colonial power. China has dispatched doctors and ventilators to Italy while offering aid to France  Germany and Spain. Last month  as the European Union banned exports of protective gear  Serbia’s president  Aleksandar Vucic  embraced China’s largess  even kissing the Chinese flag. “European solidarity does not exist ” Mr. Vucic declared. “I believe in my brother  my friend  Xi Jinping  and I believe in help from China. The only country that can help us now is China.” Chinese factories make 80 percent of the world’s antibiotics and the building blocks for a huge range of drugs. Chinese officials have pledged to continue to make these wares available to the world. Such moves may bolster China’s standing  yet appear unlikely to pacify the Trump administration. “Certainly  it would help in projecting China’s soft power ” said Yanzhong Huang  a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But I don’t know whether this would ease concerns in the West  particularly the United States  on the need to diversify the supply of the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.” President Trump has long obsessed over the trade deficit with China as a supposed scorecard of American victimization. But given China’s role as a dominant supplier of hospital gear and medicines  American health effectively depends on being able to buy more from Chinese factories. “Right now  the brightest shiny hope that we have is imports of this stuff ” said Mr. Bown  the trade expert. “We’d like to run the biggest trade deficit we could possibly find.” “It’s not that we are buying this stuff from China that’s made us vulnerable ” he added. “It’s that we are buying this stuff from China  and we decided to start a trade war with them.” China aims to become the first nation to crack the code for a vaccine  a milestone that could cement its status as a world superpower  resonating not unlike the United States’ putting a person on the moon. “Its importance lies in being able to display our scientific and technological prowess to other countries ” said Yang Zhanqiu  a virologist at Wuhan University  in the central Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged. About 1 000 Chinese scientists are now engaged in creating vaccines for the virus  with nine potential versions in development  according to the government. The government is considering bypassing some phases of planned clinical trials to rush potential vaccines into emergency use as soon as this month. But one element appears in conspicuously short supply — international collaboration. In 2003  when another coronavirus  known as SARS  spread through China with deadly impact  officials from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deployed to Beijing to help the government forge a containment strategy. In the years that followed  Chinese and American authorities collaborated on epidemics in Africa. But in recent years  American public health authorities have sharply diminished their presence in Beijing at the direction of the Trump administration  said Jennifer Huang Bouey  an epidemiologist and China expert at the RAND Corporation. “Given the overall sentiment that any scientific research will be helping China  the United States is really trying to reduce any collaboration with China ” said Ms. Bouey. “That really hurts global health.” “There’s a lack of trust ” said Mr. Huang at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Nationalism remains very strong among the Chinese public.” Some international collaboration is taking place. Dr. Seth Berkley  the chief executive of the Gavi Alliance  a nonprofit group started by Bill and Melinda Gates that works to get vaccines to the world’s poor  noted that one of the best Ebola vaccines was discovered by a Canadian public health lab  transferred to an American drug maker and then manufactured in Germany. “That’s how science is done  and we really ought to follow that paradigm ” he said. “Nothing illustrates the global nature of this problem better than Covid-19  which started off in Wuhan and spread to 180 countries within three months. This is a global challenge that requires a global response.” But even before a vaccine is confirmed  national governments are already seeking to lock up future supply. In Belgium  a company called Univercells is preparing to manufacture two vaccines that are under development even before clinical trials are completed  according to its co-founder  José Castillo. Univercells expects to begin production by September  with the eventual aim of making as many as 200 million doses a year at a pair of plants south of Brussels. One country — Mr. Castillo declined to disclose it — has already ordered half of the supply of vaccines that his company will initially make  a share that would decline to 10 percent as production increases. Some countries will most likely fail to secure enough vaccine. “It’s really a matter of scarcity ” Mr. Castillo said. More than overwhelming demand explains the anticipated shortfall. Though the science behind developing vaccines has advanced substantially  making them often involves labor-intensive techniques that are not designed to quickly produce billions of doses. “The bottleneck is to produce it  to make it in very large quantities ” Mr. Castillo said. The sense of urgency appears to have inspired President Trump to try to persuade a German company that is developing a possible vaccine to relocate to the United States. The company  CureVac  has denied it was approached by the United States  and said it had no plans to move. The president has other weapons. He could cite the Defense Production Act to force American companies to give the United States government priority over other buyers for potential vaccines. A little-known unit within the Department of Health and Human Services  whose mission is to protect American residents from bioterrorism and pandemics  gives grants to companies to speed their vaccine development. It also often comes with the requirement that recipients supply the government with a stockpile  said James Robinson  a vaccine manufacturing expert who sits on the scientific advisory board of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  an international consortium dedicated to making vaccines available worldwide. That division  the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  recently gave nearly $500 million to Johnson & Johnson to help it develop a coronavirus vaccine and set up a U.S. manufacturing facility. Johnson & Johnson declined to say whether its arrangement with the government would require it to set aside vaccines for American use. It said it currently had the ability to produce as many as 300 million doses a year at its facility in the Netherlands  was preparing to manufacture a similar number in the United States  and was working with outside partners to add capacity elsewhere. “If the current administration is still in place when the vaccines are available  they are going to be really merciless in terms of privileging the U.S. for supply versus the rest of the world ” said Michel De Wilde  a vaccine research consultant  and a former executive at Sanofi  a French vaccine manufacturer. Around the world  50 potential vaccines are now in the early stages of development  according to the W.H.O. If history is any guide  scientists will eventually produce an effective version. What is less certain is whether the benefits will be shared. “I’m worried about every country that has the potential to manufacture the vaccine ” said Dr. Richard Hatchett  the chief executive of the vaccine consortium. “They all have the ability to impose export controls. They all have the ability to nationalize their vaccine industry.” If that is what happens  the dangers proliferate. “If there are epidemics out of control in parts of the world ” said Dr. Berkley  of the Gavi Alliance  “we will never get control of this because the virus will come back and continue to spread.” Reporting was contributed by Hari Kumar  Karan Deep Singh  Kai Schultz  Javier Hernandez and Andrew Jacobs. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/business/09virus-nationalism-illo-web/09virus-nationalism-illo-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/business/00VIRUS-NATIONALISM-2/merlin_170870229_d17eb5e4-71af-4519-86c8-dbdf7685be34-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-economy.html, us politics, Torn Over Reopening Economy  Trump Says He Faces ‘Biggest Decision I’ve Ever Had to Make’, The president suggested he wanted to move soon  but he also promised to listen to public health officials cautioning against relaxing restrictions prematurely., Supported by The president suggested he wanted to move soon  but he also promised to listen to public health officials cautioning against relaxing restrictions prematurely. By Peter Baker  Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — As he grapples simultaneously with the most devastating public health and economic crises of a lifetime  President Trump finds himself pulled in opposite directions on what to do next. The bankers  corporate executives and industrialists plead with him to reopen the country as soon as possible  while the medical experts beg for more time to curb the coronavirus. The phone calls from his business friends compete against the television images of overwhelmed hospitals. The public health experts tell him what he is doing is working  so he should not let up yet. The economic advisers and others in his White House tell him what he has done has worked  so he should begin to figure out how to ease up. Tens of thousands more could die. Millions more could lose their jobs. “I’m going to have to make a decision  and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision ” Mr. Trump said on Friday during his daily news briefing on the fight against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 18 000 Americans so far and put more than 16 million out of work. “But I would say without question it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.” Seizing on new estimates of a lower-than-projected death toll  the president signaled that he wanted to start resuming business on some basis after his current stay-at-home guidelines expire on April 30  and he announced that he would name a task force next week to develop a plan. But he also promised to listen to public health officials cautioning against a premature move to relax limits. In actuality  the decision on when and how to reopen is not entirely Mr. Trump’s to make because he never ordered it closed. The stay-at-home edicts that have kept the vast bulk of Americans indoors were issued by governors state by state. But the president did issue nonbinding guidelines urging a pause in daily life through the end of the month. And if he were to issue new guidance saying it was safe to reopen or outlining a path toward reopening  many states would most likely follow or feel pressure from their businesses and constituents to ease up on restrictions. “We’re not doing anything until we know this country is going to be healthy ” Mr. Trump said. “We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again.” But he added that the nation’s current paralysis was not sustainable. “You know what? Staying at home leads to death also ” he said. “It’s very traumatic for the country.” The number of deaths worldwide from the coronavirus topped 100 000 on Friday  as a surge of cases in Moscow pushed the Russian capital’s health care system to its limit. Lockdowns were extended across much of the globe heading into the Easter weekend  as countries desperately struggled to slow infections. The strain of people out of work and dependent on assistance was starting to show. A distribution of food turned into a bloody melee in a poor area of Nairobi  Kenya. In the United States  the death toll has surpassed that of Spain  with only Italy reporting more. In Washington  lawmakers and administration officials made some progress in breaking a stalemate over a $250 billion federal infusion to replenish a fast-depleting loan program for distressed small businesses. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said that the Trump administration had agreed to bipartisan negotiations early next week. But the central question dominating the conversation in Washington  New York and elsewhere was how long would it be until the country could begin to get back to normal. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York  the hardest hit state  said any easing of restrictions would require widespread testing to cover millions of workers first  while Mr. Trump said that “you don’t need full testing” but instead concentrated screening in the most affected areas. New government projections presented to officials this week concluded that stay-at-home orders  school closures and social distancing have greatly reduced infections  but added that lifting them after only 30 days  as the president is considering  could result in a rash of new illnesses and fatalities that would rival doing nothing to counter the pandemic. Without any of the mitigation policies now in place  the death toll from the coronavirus could have reached 300 000  according to the projections. But if the 30-day stay-at-home guideline is lifted  the death toll could reach 200 000  even if schools remain closed until summer  25 percent of the country continues to work from home and some social distancing continues. Using the demand for ventilators as a stand-in for serious coronavirus infection rates  the model foresees a modest bump immediately after stay-at-home orders are lifted and a major new increase in infections about 70 days after a shelter order is lifted  peaking after 120 days. The projections  dated Thursday  were prepared by the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services and obtained by The New York Times. These numbers fueling the projections may already be out of date. Forecasts accepted by the White House that once estimated at least 100 000 deaths in the United States have now been revised to about 60 000 thanks to aggressive social distancing. But if the numbers are off  the direction and increases may be consistent. The government models show a rise in demand for ventilators 120 days after lifting stay-at-home restrictions that would be more severe than if the United States had never issued such orders in the first place and instead relied simply on school closures  sending people home to telework and directing the public to socially distance. Christopher Murray  the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington whose forecasts have been relied on by the White House  added a warning against lifting restrictions too soon. “It’s enough to say that if we were to stop at the national level May 1  we’re seeing a return to almost where we are now sometime in July ” he said on CNN. At his briefing on Friday  Mr. Trump said he was not aware of the government’s own latest forecasts  but aides said he had interpreted the decreasing death projection to mean that his health advisers may have been overly pessimistic. The president cited the 60 000 estimated death toll as evidence of progress. “I think we’ll be substantially under that number ” he said of the earlier 100 000 forecast. “Hard to believe that if you have 60 000  you can never be happy  but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told.” But his public health advisers took a more cautious approach. “As encouraging as they are  we have not reached the peak ” Dr. Deborah L. Birx  the White House pandemic coordinator  said of the latest figures. She noted that without universal testing  experts were seeing only the most serious cases. “Is this the tip of the iceberg  or is this half the iceberg or three-quarters of the iceberg that we’ve seen to date?” she said. Five administration officials said it was highly unlikely that Mr. Trump would extend the guidelines beyond April 30  adding that he would be more likely to find a way to announce some lifting of quarantine measures  even if it might not be a full flip-the-lightswitch reopening of the country. Mr. Trump has been having conversations  both formally and informally  in recent weeks with business leaders like Michael Corbat  the chief executive of Citigroup  and Brian Moynihan  the chief executive of Bank of America  about how to support the economy and when it might be able to reopen. Many of those discussions have been facilitated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who has fielded calls from executives like Stephen A. Schwarzman  the chief executive of Blackstone  looking for a road map to when a semblance of normalcy could return  although some people close to the discussions said that Mr. Schwarzman and Steven Roth  a real estate investor close to Mr. Trump  have not been aggressive as others. Other business executives have gone through Jared Kushner  the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Paul Tudor Jones made an impassioned push to reopen the economy on a conference call organized by Mr. Kushner several weeks ago  these people said  and the investor Nelson Peltz was said to be influential in Mr. Trump’s since-aborted plan to begin reopening by Easter. Lobbying groups have become more vocal about the need for the administration to create a plan for the reopening of the economy. “The longer we stay shut down  the worse off people will be and the harder it will be getting the economy going again and getting people jobs so they can go back to work ” said David McIntosh  the president of the Club for Growth. “What we need now is a plan for when we reopen the economy  because the plan curve has been flattened.” Some business leaders have been particularly frustrated that the government is not being realistic about the economic consequences of the fight against the coronavirus. They note that there are many health risks and that not all of them warrant shutting down the economy. Jacob Wintersteen  a real estate developer in Texas and the finance chairman for the Houston area for the state’s Republican Party  said businesses should have the right to operate if they see fit despite the risks. “People in front of my face are watching their businesses be destroyed by our choice of the cure ” he said. The president’s economic advisers have been laying the groundwork for reopening the economy. Larry Kudlow  the chairman of the National Economic Council  said this week on the Fox Business Network that he could envision returning to work on a rolling basis within the next four to eight weeks. Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC that it could happen as soon as May 1. However  people close to Mr. Mnuchin have suggested that a more gradual timeline for reopening the economy could begin in May based on the availability of coronavirus testing and regional case numbers. Mr. Kushner and Peter Navarro  the president’s trade adviser  likewise have talked about opening in stages as quickly as possible  fearing that banks will start having real problems if the lockdown continues through May. Economists say that lifting restrictions  particularly on nonessential businesses  will restore a limited amount of activity to an economy that is currently in a free fall. But some of the president’s advisers like Marc Short  the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence  have argued that  ultimately  business leaders will not wait for health professionals or administration officials once new infections and deaths start to decrease and may simply reopen their firms. Many experts caution that growth will be slow when it returns because people will be wary of resuming normal activities before the country has far more extensive testing. Without widespread confidence in returning to work or other public activities  any economic recovery could be tepid. A survey of business leaders and market participants this week by S&P Global found that only 12 percent of respondents believed the economy would make a “quick complete recovery” soon. A quick restart  though  could carry risks for the economy. If the government tells Americans to return to normal life and infections rise again  that could wipe out consumer optimism and lead to a longer  more damaging recession. “It’s not clear to me that the pandemic’s direct effect on the economy will end in June” or anytime close to that  said Karl Smith  the vice president for federal policy at the Tax Foundation in Washington. “Even after official restrictions are lifted  lots of people may be uncertain about jumping back into ordinary life. Companies may be uncertain about putting their workers at risk.” Reporting was contributed by Eileen Sullivan  Jim Tankersley and Annie Karni from Washington  and Kate Kelly and Andrew Ross Sorkin from New York. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/us/politics/11dc-virus-trump1/merlin_171481077_418bc046-46d1-4b7c-867b-a22639531869-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v2.png

By Ana Swanson WASHINGTON — Factories are idled. Workers are in lockdown. Goods are piling up at some ports  while elsewhere container ships sail empty. Dairy farmers are dumping their milk  while toilet paper aisles at the grocery store have been picked bare. The spread of the coronavirus has disrupted global supply chains  leading to shortages and price increases that are cascading from factories to ports to retail stores to consumers. While factories in China have been slowly restarting as the country’s epidemic fades  many manufacturers in India  the United States and Europe are powering down  or running at partial capacity. These disruptions in global trade could grow more noticeable in the months to come  as consumers hoard products and countries clamp down on exports of medical supplies and even food. Shoppers may see more shortages of unexpected products  including laptops  toilet paper and medicines. Some companies could find themselves lacking raw materials and components  a recipe for further financial trouble. At the White House on Friday  President Trump said he was allocating at least $16 billion to American farmers  ranchers and agricultural producers to keep the American food supply stable. “In this time of crisis we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning  right from beginning to end ” he said. On Wednesday  the United States put its own export restrictions on medical supplies needed to fight the virus  echoing bans in Europe  India  Turkey and elsewhere that critics have said could leave some parts of the world short. In live-streamed remarks that morning  Roberto Azevedo  the director general of the World Trade Organization  said the contraction in global trade this year would be “ugly ” representing the sharpest decline in international commerce in a generation. The World Trade Organization is forecasting that global trade volume could shrink between 13 percent and 32 percent  or even more  compared with the previous year. “We project that trade in 2020 will fall steeply in every region of the world and basically across all sectors ” Mr. Azevedo said. Global trade growth had already slowed last year to its lowest level since the financial crisis  bogged down by a trade war between the United States and China and slowing economies in Europe and Asia. But the pandemic has slammed the brakes on various segments of global trade. Container volume in Shanghai  the world’s busiest port  fell 20 percent year-over-year in February  while cargo volume sank 23 percent at the port of Los Angeles in the same time period. Earlier this year  much of that collapse stemmed from disruptions in goods coming from China  where many factories were locked down. That has particularly affected industries like electronics and industrial machinery  which rely heavily on factories in China to power global supply chains. Laptop exports from China to the United States have plummeted  for instance  just as demand is surging as companies switch to remote work and students are thrust into distance learning. But like the virus  which spread from China to the rest of the world  so too will the economic disruptions  which are likely to intensify in months to come. For companies and consumers who have come to rely on being able to ship goods rapidly and seamlessly around the world  the disruptions could come as a shock. “China has shown us how extreme the downturn in industrial activity can be ” said Chris Rogers  a global trade and logistics analyst at Panjiva. He said that seaborne shipments from China to the United States were down 45 percent in the first two weeks of March compared with the same period a year earlier. For the last several months  factories in China have been slowly coming back to life  though many are still operating at partial capacity  and could be shut down if the virus resurfaces. But while Chinese factories recover  demand for many products is cratering elsewhere. Those places include the United States and Europe  where demand for goods and services is falling as workers lose jobs and cut spending  leaving American businesses scrambling to cancel orders from China. Around the world  factories are shuttering for a variety of reasons. Workers are quarantined or staying home to care for children who are out of school while some factories lack components and raw materials. Others simply have no need to manufacture products since no one is buying them. Automakers and other major manufacturers  including Volkswagen  Peugeot  Ford and General Motors  idled factories in the United States and Europe in mid-March  in turn reducing demand for steel  electronics and other components. Those trends have sown chaos and confusion in global shipping markets. Products have been piling up at container terminals in China  while some ships departing from the United States have been sailing empty  planning to pick up goods at another port. As plane traffic plummets  airfreight — often used for more lightweight and expensive items like iPhones and lobster — has become prohibitively expensive. UPS  DHL Global and FedEx have suspended service guarantees  saying they expect delays in shipping as a result of the coronavirus. “Even if coronavirus were to magically disappear tomorrow  it would still takes weeks if not longer for supply chains to get moving again  and probably months before you felt like things were normal again ” said Robert M. Landry  the chief commercial officer of the Port of New Orleans. The situation is likely to worsen over the next few months. Mike Jette  vice president of consulting services at GEP  which provides supply chain software and strategy for General Mills  Exxon Mobil  Macy’s  Walmart and other major companies  predicted that peak disruption for major companies with international supply chains would likely happen three months from now. Mr. Jette said that companies making electronics  appliances and other products would exhaust their “safety stock” for components in the coming weeks. In the longer run  supply chain experts say  the crisis may lead to restructuring — where apparel  electronics and pharmaceutical companies rethink their supply chains to make sure they are globally diversified  and less dependent solely on one location  like China. But for the moment  the crisis is unfurling so quickly that companies are often unable to plan ahead. “Right now  companies are trying to figure out if they’re going to be in business in the next couple months ” said Jon Gold  vice president for supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. “They are completely re-evaluating how supply chains are going to work  what consumer confidence is going to be and what consumers are buying.” So far  many of the product shortages in the United States and Europe don’t stem from an actual lack of goods  but rather surging demand from nervous consumers  who are stockpiling bleach  toilet paper  diapers and dried beans. Other shortages are occurring as producers of toilet paper  food and other products try to figure out how to reconfigure supply chains that are set up to provide bulk shipments to restaurants and schools to instead meet household demand. “There’s no shortage of calories available  it’s just they’re in the wrong size bag ” Mr. Rogers said. Companies that sell kegs of beer to restaurants and large rolls of commercial toilet paper to airports and schools can’t repackage and redistribute their products overnight. For industries with perishable products  this has been a major problem. Dairy farmers have been forced to dump milk they cannot get to consumers or to consider culling their herds. Matt Herrick  a senior vice president at the International Dairy Foods Association  said the dairy industry was not facing any production shortages. Unlike other sectors of the economy  dairy farmers can’t shut down — their cows continue to produce milk. But unlike meat or grain  milk cannot be frozen or stored for long periods of time. That means the dairy industry is facing the possibility of millions of pounds of food waste a week  now that milk is no longer in demand from the restaurants  ice cream stores  coffee shops and concession stands  Mr. Herrick said. That’s true for export markets like Canada  Mexico and China  as well as within the United States  where commercial food service accounts for roughly half of all food sales. Most food producers have been designated as “essential” businesses  and continue to operate even through the pandemic. But some have lowered their output to comply with social distancing measures. And some farms and companies are also seeing shortages of truck drivers and migrant laborers  who typically plant and harvest fruits and vegetables. Mr. Gold of the National Retail Federation  which includes Walmart  Target and other major food retailers  said it was too early to say whether consumers could see shortages of some food items in the coming months. But he said that states needed to coordinate to ensure that all links in the food supply chain remained open and continued to function. “It’s not just the manufacturing facility  it’s the farm  the trucking facilities  the distribution facility ” Mr. Gold said. Around the world  other lockdowns could portend shortages in metals and medicines. In South Africa  a lockdown has idled the world’s biggest mines for platinum and palladium. In India  which provides 40 percent of the American generic drug supply  as well as many of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that go into making medicines  health experts warn that stay-at-home orders could disrupt the supply of pharmaceutical products to the United States. India barred exports of a few key drugs last month  but reversed the curbs this week under intense pressure from the United States. A nationwide lockdown could still complicate the process of making and distributing essential drugs  said Yanzhong Huang  a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. By Friday  75 governments had already put limits on exports of medical supplies  according to tracking by Simon Evenett  a professor of international trade at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Those governments include the United States  which officially imposed its own ban on exports of respirators  gloves and surgical masks this week  joining the European Union  India  China and Turkey. These items now cannot leave the United States without the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Restrictions that China put on exporting face masks  ventilators  thermometers and other products last week have also stopped American companies from shipping protective gear for their employees to use around the world. Some countries are starting to limit food exports as well. Vietnam has barred exports of rice  Thailand has blocked eggs  Russia has restricted grains while Kazakhstan is preventing wheat  potatoes and other products from leaving. Dr. Evenett said food bans were nowhere near as pervasive as the restrictions on medical supplies — or the restrictions on food that happened between 2006 and 2008  when the prices of some global food commodities spiked. But the potential for wider bans does pose a concern  he said. Organizations like the World Bank and World Trade Organization have urged countries to refrain from imposing new export restrictions  particularly on medical goods  and to map out a coordinated response to ramp up production. “No country is self-sufficient  no matter how powerful or advanced it may be ” Mr. Azevedo said in a video posted to the WTO’s site in March. “Keeping trade open and investments flowing will be critical to keep shelves plentiful and prices affordable.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html, technology, Burning Cell Towers  Out of Baseless Fear They Spread the Virus, A conspiracy theory linking the spread of the coronavirus to 5G wireless technology has spurred more than 100 incidents this month  British officials said., Supported by A conspiracy theory linking the spread of the coronavirus to 5G wireless technology has spurred more than 100 incidents this month  British officials said. By Adam Satariano and Davey Alba LONDON — On April 2  a wireless tower was set ablaze in Birmingham. The next day  a fire was reported at 10 p.m. at a telecommunications box in Liverpool. An hour later  an emergency call came in about another cell tower in Liverpool that was going up in flames. Across Britain  more than 30 acts of arson and vandalism have taken place against wireless towers and other telecom gear this month  according to police reports and a telecom trade group. In roughly 80 other incidents in the country  telecom technicians have been harassed on the job. The attacks were fueled by the same cause  government officials said: an internet conspiracy theory that links the spread of the coronavirus to an ultrafast wireless technology known as 5G. Under the false idea  which has gained momentum in Facebook groups  WhatsApp messages and YouTube videos  radio waves sent by 5G technology are causing small changes to people’s bodies that make them succumb to the virus. The incidents starkly demonstrate how coronavirus conspiracy theories have taken a dark turn by spilling out into the real world. In just a few weeks  the pandemic has given pre-existing fringe ideas online new urgency by playing on people’s fears. Before the coronavirus  rarely did such theories cause as much tangible harm so quickly  disinformation researchers said. In the United States  one person died after self-medicating with chloroquine  which was touted online as a miracle cure for the coronavirus even though its efficacy is unproven. And Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  was assigned more security this month after unfounded theories spread that he was part of a secret cabal working to undermine President Trump. “Most conspiracies stay online  but this is having real-world impact ” said Alexandre Alaphilippe  executive director of the E.U. DisinfoLab  a Brussels-based group tracking virus conspiracy theories. He called managing pandemic misinformation “a new problem” because the disease is global and people everywhere are hunting for information. The false theory linking 5G to the coronavirus has been especially prominent  amplified by celebrities like John Cusack and Woody Harrelson on social media. It has also been stoked by a vocal anti-5G contingent  who have urged people to take action against telecom gear to protect themselves. The idea has deep internet roots. An analysis by The New York Times found 487 Facebook communities  84 Instagram accounts  52 Twitter accounts  and dozens of other posts and videos pushing the conspiracy. The Facebook communities added nearly half a million new followers over the past two weeks. On Instagram  a network of 40 accounts nearly doubled its audience this month to 58 800 followers. On YouTube  the 10 most popular 5G coronavirus conspiracy videos posted in March were viewed over 5.8 million times. Today  the conspiracy can be found on Facebook in over 30 countries  including Switzerland  Uruguay and Japan. British politicians said the conspiracy theory and the violent acts it was causing were unacceptable. “This is nonsense of the absolute highest order ” said Julian Knight  a member of Parliament who leads a committee investigating coronavirus-related online misinformation. He said Facebook and YouTube needed to “get a grip” on the situation or risk undermining the crisis response. Mr. Knight added that the spread of 5G conspiracies raised alarms about how information about a future coronavirus vaccine would be disseminated. “If we were to get a vaccine for Covid-19  can we trust the social media companies to ensure that the right public health messages are put out about that vaccine?” he asked. “That could be a question of life and death for many people.” Facebook  which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp  said it was “starting to remove false claims that 5G technology causes the symptoms of or contraction of Covid-19.” YouTube said it would reduce recommendations of videos linking the coronavirus to 5G  while Twitter said it had taken action against misleading and harmful content about the illness. Wild claims about 5G are not new. The technology has an outsize political importance because it may provide countries with a competitive edge  with faster wireless speeds enabling more rapid development of driverless cars and other innovations. Internet trolls have seized on 5G and its political implications to sow fear  leading to protests in the United States and elsewhere against the technology in recent years. Russians have pushed claims that 5G signals were linked to brain cancer  infertility  autism  heart tumors and Alzheimer’s disease  all of which lacked scientific support. In January  as the coronavirus rippled through Wuhan  China  and beyond  it provided new fodder for anti-5G trolls. On Jan. 19  a post on Twitter speculated on a link between 5G and the disease  according to Zignal Labs  a media insights company that studied 699 000 mentions of the conspiracy this year through April 7. “Wuhan has 5 000+ #5G base stations now and 50 000 by 2021 — is it a disease or 5G?” the tweet said. On Jan. 22  an article on a Belgium news website included a comment from a physician claiming that 5G was harmful to people’s health. Though it did not specifically mention the coronavirus  the doctor mentioned a possible “link with current events.” The article  later deleted by the publisher  reached as many as 115 000 people  according to CrowdTangle  a tool that analyzes interactions across social media. By last month  5G-coronavirus claims on the web and television were rising  according to Zignal Labs. A YouTube video that connected the virus to 5G last month racked up roughly two million views before the site deleted it. And the singer Keri Hilson  as well as Mr. Harrelson and Mr. Cusack  posted online about the conspiracy. “A lot of my friends have been talking about the negative effects of 5G ” Mr. Harrelson wrote on Instagram to his two million followers last week  sharing a screenshot of an article that drew links between the outbreak in Wuhan and 5G development there. A representative for Mr. Harrelson  whose 5G posts have since been deleted  declined to comment. Ms. Hilson’s manager said her posts had been removed because “we feel that at this time it is important to focus on the things that we know are 100 percent accurate.” After publication of this article  Mr. Cusack  through his publicist  said he was raising general health concerns about 5G; his 5G tweets have been deleted. The conspiracy particularly resonated in Britain. In January  Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given the Chinese technology company Huawei permission to set up 5G infrastructure in the country. In recent weeks  conspiracy theorists began saying China’s lack of transparency on Covid-19 was evidence that Huawei should not be trusted to install 5G in Britain. Some went further and called for the destruction of wireless equipment. “We need to bring 5G down ” said one person in the Facebook group Stop 5G U.K.  which has more than 58 600 members. After the British government issued shelter-in-place orders on March 23  some conspiracy theorists commented that it was a trick to secretly build 5G masts out of public view. On April 2  in one of the first 5G-coronavirus incidents  telecom equipment in a neighborhood of Belfast in Northern Ireland was set ablaze  according to local officials. “I just couldn’t believe it ” said Carl Whyte  a Belfast City Council member. “They are seeing these conspiracy theories on social media and going out and destroying those masts.” Word of the fire spread around the Belfast area. Richard Kerr  the minister at Templepatrick Presbyterian Church in nearby Ballyclare  said  “I was taken aback that it went to that level that people were prepared to commit arson.” Other fires of telecom towers followed in Birmingham  Liverpool and elsewhere. Videos of burning equipment were shared and celebrated on Facebook. Some videos also showed telecom technicians being harassed. “You know when they turn this on it’s going to kill everyone ” a woman said of 5G in a recent video on Twitter  as she confronted technicians laying fiber-optic cables in an unidentified British town. Mark Steele  a prominent anti-5G activist in Britain  said the fires were a result of people being frustrated that their safety concerns weren’t taken seriously. Asked if he believed 5G was causing coronavirus  he said  “It’s looking a bit suspicious  don’t you think?” Telecommunications companies  which have added more security and are working with law enforcement  said the attacks against their workers and equipment had been widespread  threatening communication networks during the crisis. Vodafone said it had experienced at least 15 incidents  while BT has had at least 11. The companies said that in many cases  vandals had damaged existing infrastructure and not new 5G gear. The police in Belfast  Liverpool and Birmingham said they were continuing to investigate the incidents  reviewing security-camera footage and asking the public for leads. Anti-5G groups have continued adding hundreds of members. One Facebook user shared photos this week of a wireless tower being constructed in an unidentified area of Britain. “Light it up ” one commenter responded.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-hospitals.html, nyregion, Virus Deaths Mount  but N.Y. Avoids Predicted Surge at Hospitals So Far, Officials had estimated that 140 000 hospital beds might be needed to treat coronavirus patients. Only about 18 500 were in use by week’s end., Supported by Officials had estimated that 140 000 hospital beds might be needed to treat coronavirus patients. Only about 18 500 were in use by week’s end. By Alan Feuer and Jesse McKinley On March 24 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appeared at the Jacob K. Javits Center in Manhattan and  as soldiers scrambled to transform it into a hospital  he offered the public a dire assessment. Sophisticated scientists  Mr. Cuomo said  had studied the coming coronavirus outbreak and their projections were alarming. Infections were doubling nearly every three days and the state would soon require an unthinkable expansion of its health care system. To stave off a catastrophe  New York might need up to 140 000 hospital beds and as many as 40 000 intensive care units with ventilators. “One of the forecasters said to me we were looking at a freight train coming across the country ” Mr. Cuomo said. Two weeks later  however  with an unprecedented shutdown of public schools  countless businesses and most of outdoor life  New York has managed to avoid the apocalyptic vision that some of the forecasters predicted. The daily death toll has still been staggering  approaching 800 for a third straight day on Friday  and some hospitals continue to teeter on the brink of chaos. But the number of intensive care beds being used declined for the first time in the crisis  to 4 908  according to daily figures released on Friday. And the total number hospitalized with the virus  18 569  was far lower than the darkest expectations. In yet another sign that the worst of the predictions had not yet come to pass  the Javits Center  the convention center where Mr. Cuomo offered his worrisome assessment  was treating only 300 patients. The rest of its roughly 2 500 beds were empty. Whether used to analyze the weather or the stock market  statistical models are often an uneasy mix of guesswork and science  and they have proved to be of variable use in predicting the virus outbreak  a calamity that has no precedent in the past 100 years. Perhaps the biggest unknown was how people would react when told to stay at home and keep six feet apart from one another whenever they went out. Mr. Cuomo has relied on several models in making his decisions  and while each is slightly different  they all convinced him that the wisest course of action was to plan for the worst while hoping for the best. The models also helped Mr. Cuomo and other governors project an air of confidence amid the crisis and to come up with the cover they required to place their states under crippling restrictions that have damaged economies and brought most aspects of life to a halt. When asked on Friday at his daily news briefing whether he feared losing credibility for trusting some models that had proven to be less than accurate  Mr. Cuomo said no. “I think my credibility would be affected if I didn’t ask experts for their opinion ” he said. The governor also said that the discrepancy between the predictions and the actual statistics was because of the behavior of New Yorkers themselves. With some exceptions  New Yorkers have managed to follow the restrictions on movement and socializing. Dr. Deborah Birx  the White House coronavirus response coordinator  seemed to agree and congratulated Mr. Cuomo and his counterparts on Friday for having slowed the tide of infections in their states. “That has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut and now Rhode Island are doing to really change the course of this pandemic ” Dr. Birx said. It is  of course  prudent politically and for public health reasons that elected leaders over-plan  not under-plan  for disasters. During hurricanes  for instance  governors are much more likely to save their constituents’ lives  and their own jobs  by ordering evacuations early rather than banking on the chance that a storm will peter out. The main objective in “flattening the curve” of the outbreak  apart from keeping people from dying  is to slow the spread enough to keep hospitals functioning. And from the start of the coronavirus emergency  Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly taken the position that he would rather be prepared for a dire scenario that never came to pass than to blithely put his faith in optimistic forecasts. Ironically  his doomsday attitude may complicate his efforts to keep the state on course as New Yorkers start to realize that the worst has not happened and eventually get itchy to go out. Conservative pundits  like John Cardillo of Newsmax.com and Bill Mitchell  the host of the online talk show “YourVoice America ” have already seized on the gap between the grimmest models and the upward-trending facts to criticize social-distancing measures and to argue that the national economy should be reopened quickly. President Trump  after initially playing down the outbreak  has finally seemed to take the models seriously. But Mr. Trump has also used them to revise expectations about his handling of the pandemic  saying he will consider himself to have succeeded if he holds the total death count to under the current predictions of around 100 000. The models that Mr. Cuomo has used to justify the restrictive measures in New York did not fully take into account the effect those measures might have had. One of the models  created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington  which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  was initially based mainly on data from the epidemic in Wuhan  China  which many experts now consider unreliable. Outbreaks in Italy and Spain peaked more recently and provide a fuller picture of how quickly infections can be brought under control. The institute’s statistics from April 1 projected that by Friday  more than 70 000 New Yorkers would be hospitalized with the virus  more than four times the number that actually were. Ali H. Mokdad  a professor of health metrics sciences at the institute  said that in general  projections of how many hospital beds would be needed have been revised downward continually to reflect new data. The institute’s predictions issued on Wednesday were much closer to reality  indicating a need for 21 000 beds in New York by Friday. The institute’s earlier nationwide models also overestimated the number of days that patients who were not admitted to intensive care units would spend in the hospital. The original prediction had been 15 days  but on April 5  the institute reported it was actually only eight days. Patients who died were doing so faster than initially estimated. “It is possible that people who were sicker came first and were more likely to die ” Mr. Mokdad said. (The institute’s predictions related to the number of deaths in New York have been more consistent and closer to the actual statistics.) Some hospitals have also noticed sharp drops in the number of people seeking hospital care for ailments unrelated to the coronavirus. With much of normal life paused  there are fewer violent crimes and far fewer car accidents. Doctors believe that some New Yorkers are avoiding the hospital out of fear that a visit could get them sick. Around the country  doctors have also noticed a worrisome drop in cardiac admissions. “We’ve been seeing much lower rates of some other sorts of emergencies ” said Dr. Andrew Bauerschmidt  a critical care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. “I was covering stroke calls from the emergency department last week  and the volume was far lower than usual.” “What the public needs to know is that if you are really sick with something that’s not Covid  you should still call 911 or come to the hospital ” he said. “What we don’t want is for people to not seek medical attention just because they are not having something related to Covid.” For some of these reasons  or perhaps for all of them  New York’s hospitals have been able to scale back some of their most serious and unusual contingency plans. Only weeks ago  there were grave concerns that the hospitals  confronting a flood of gasping patients  would run short of lifesaving ventilators. But by Friday  doctors had largely abandoned the experimental practice of ventilator sharing  in which one machine was used to support several patients. On Friday  Mr. Cuomo still seemed to be balancing optimism with caution and trying to understand how the projections he received had not yet squared with the realities he was seeing. “How do you come up with an actual curve that is so much different than what those experts predicted?” he asked. Part of the answer  he reasoned  was that it remained unclear whether the statewide shutdown he ordered last month would continue to be followed and effective. But even more unclear  he said  was the situation itself. “In fairness to the experts  nobody has been here before ” Mr. Cuomo said. “Nobody. So  everyone is trying to figure it out the best they can.” Reporting was contributed by James Glanz  Brian M. Rosenthal and Margot Sanger-Katz.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/coronavirus-california-school.html, us, For Students at a Lone School in California  Class Is Still On, Out of the 10 521 public schools in California  Outside Creek is the only one with its doors open., Supported by Out of the 10 521 public schools in California  Outside Creek is the only one with its doors open. By Brian Wollitz and Ali DeFazio FARMERSVILLE  Calif. — At 7:45 on a recent morning  the strangest of scenes unfolded at Outside Creek Elementary: A school bus pulled up. Students stepped off and sauntered to class. The principal  Derrick Bravo  greeted a parent with a friendly hey-there handshake. It was humdrum normalcy in the most abnormal of times  as if there were no pandemic  no statewide order to shelter in place  no social-distancing directives. Of the 10 521 public schools in California  Outside Creek is the lone holdout  a tiny school in a remote rural community in the San Joaquin Valley that is insisting on holding classes for the 21 students from kindergarten through eighth grade who showed up last week. [Sign up for the California Today newsletter for news from across the state.] Mr. Bravo  who is also the school’s superintendent and eighth-grade teacher  said he and the school board did not make the decision lightly. Yes  local health authorities had urged all schools to close  and every other school in Tulare County had done just that after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a shelter-in-place order for the entire state on March 19. They also knew the numbers — 10 dead so far out of at least 187 residents in the county who have tested positive for the coronavirus. But when Mr. Bravo turned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice  the nation’s leading authority on infectious diseases seemed to suggest in its written guidance that small schools outside hot spots could remain open if they took precautions. And then Mr. Bravo thought about the everyday struggles of the families who work the citrus and walnut groves here. Nearly every one of his students qualifies for free or subsidized lunches  and remote learning is a fantasy for the many families who cannot afford internet access. “We thought about just our rural area and the resources available for our kids ” Mr. Bravo said. As the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerates across the United States  Outside Creek illustrates the challenge of enforcing uniform social-distancing policies in a country that prizes local control over schools. Under California law  only one official other than Mr. Bravo has the power to close Outside Creek — the governor. Mr. Newsom has repeatedly called on every school in the state to remain closed for the rest of the academic year. His shelter-in-place order is also unequivocal: “Everyone in California is required to stay home except to get food  care for a relative or friend  get necessary health care  or go to an essential job ” it reads. Outside Creek may be the only school  not just the only public school  still open in California; representatives of the state’s 3 315 private schools said they knew of no private school that has defied Mr. Newsom’s order. Yet Mr. Newsom  well aware of Tulare County’s conservative politics  has refrained from confronting Outside Creek. His spokesman would say only this: “School officials should use guidance from federal  state and local public officials in deciding how best to serve students.” Karen Elliott  the county’s public health director  has stressed that it is best for parents to keep their children home. Three-quarters of Outside Creek’s parents have decided to do just that  with their children taking independent study courses devised by Mr. Bravo’s staff. The situation in Outside Creek is exceptionally rare not only for California  but also nationwide. Every state has ordered or recommended school closures. While some religious schools initially dragged their feet  the overwhelming majority of the nation’s schools are now shuttered. Even in states that strongly advised schools to close without a formal mandate  like Kentucky and South Dakota  state education departments said on Tuesday that they were unaware of any open public schools. Outside Creek  the oldest school in Tulare County (it opened during the Civil War)  consists of two small buildings surrounded by rows of walnut trees. College pennants hang in the cafeteria  each signifying where a graduate landed. Just about everyone associated with the school proudly calls themselves Swamp Rats  a name inspired by a former football coach who told his players they needed to be as tough as those creatures. The moniker stuck  and the school even voted to change its mascot from the Eagles. “It’s more than just a school ” said one Swamp Rat parent  Sylvia Gomez. Mrs. Gomez said that while her family is “one of the lucky ones” with a home computer  she decided against keeping her daughter home. “I send her because education is more important than anything in the world.” Ben Orozco  a dispatcher at a trucking company  said his wife’s family had sent generations of their children to Outside Creek. He said the area was used to hardship and bad breaks. “At the end of the day  I feel like we have a higher percentage to get in an accident and die than get the coronavirus ” he said before he dropped off his 10-year-old daughter  Belynda. “If we decide to keep our kid in school ” he added  “that’s our decision as a parent  nobody else’s.” Swamp Rat parents have also asked why Outside Creek Elementary should close when day care centers  which are exempt from the state’s shelter-in-place orders  are still open all over town. “There’s day cares open with more children ” said one parent  Marylu Cuevas  who would have continued sending her children to school if not for the fact that a hospice care worker lives with them. For his part  Mr. Bravo  the superintendent  does not dispute the dangers of this virus. Door handles at Outside Creek are disinfected constantly. Students sanitize their desks. Tape is stuck on the cafeteria floor at six-foot intervals to space out the lunch line. But social distancing is easier said than done in elementary school. On a recent day  children converged into tangled clusters as they played ball on the playground. Tony Thurmond  California’s superintendent for public instruction  has urged Mr. Bravo to reconsider his decision and fall in line. “Quite frankly ” he said at a news conference  “none of us knows when it’s safe enough for our students to return to campus.” But then there have been voices like Devin Nunes  the Republican congressman whose district includes Outside Creek. On Fox News last week  Mr. Nunes criticized the push to close California’s schools. “Way overkill ” he called it. Last week  Mr. Bravo gave three eighth-grade students a grammar lesson on modifiers. The students were careful to spread out  and Mr. Bravo  a trim man with close-cropped black hair and a five o’clock shadow  paced the room past the posters of the U.S. Constitution and the periodic table  past the fish tank where students are studying trout eggs  offering help and encouragement. “It keeps me going when I see those three students every day for whatever reason that they’re here ” Mr. Bravo said. Outside Creek is now closed for spring break. Students are due back on Tuesday  but Mr. Bravo said he was considering extending the break by a week. Then  he hopes  school will resume.

We have no sterile tools  they told her at one. No incubator  they said at another. She took another bus. She slept on a bench. She cried in the street  losing count of the number of doctors who had placed their hands inside her  measuring her body’s dilation  only to tell her to leave. She tried a fifth hospital. We can’t help you  they said. Finally  in Caracas  the capital  she stood outside the largest maternity ward in the country and sent up a last  desperate plea. “Please God ” Ms. Vásquez prayed  “please don’t let me die.” Venezuela’s public health system  once the best in Latin America  has been in a state of progressive collapse for years  crippled by a broken economy overseen by an increasingly authoritarian government. But few parts of that system have been as damaged as its maternity wards  where the most critical birthing tools — vital sign monitors  ventilators  sanitation systems — have broken down or just disappeared  sometimes forcing doctors to turn women away. About half of the country’s physicians  some 30 000 people  have left in recent years  many of them desperate to save their own families  according to the Venezuelan Medical Federation. The true impact of this on mothers and babies is unknown. The most recent data come from 2016  when maternal deaths shot up by 65 percent and infant mortality rose by 30 percent in a single year. The minister who published that information was promptly fired — and new statistics have been treated as a state secret since. To understand what it is like to give birth in this shattered system  we followed pregnant women to six hospitals in Venezuela  and one across the border in Colombia  as they sought to deliver. To give birth in Venezuela today is to risk death — for both the woman and her child. Ms. Vásquez was once a high school handball player so celebrated for her strength and skill that she traveled Latin America representing Venezuela. But one day this January  on the doorstep of a towering Caracas hospital  Concepción Palacios  she crumpled  sobbing  her arms around the waist of her mother  Cristina  who pounded on the door  begging for her daughter to be admitted. Ms. Vásquez fainted. But then the door opened  and about 48 hours after her labor pains began  she gave birth to baby Cristal. But her infant  born premature and tiny at just 3.3 pounds  didn’t make it past morning. Days later  Ms. Vásquez pulled a white baby blanket from the pocket of her sweatshirt  one of her only memories of her daughter. Hospital officials had declined to give her a death certificate  and with no money for a burial  she had to leave Cristal’s body in the morgue. “Here ” she said  “a woman is treated like a dog.” For many Venezuelan women today  the defining feature of childbirth is the ruleta  or roulette: The grueling process of traveling from hospital to hospital  trying to find one that is equipped to help them. They sometimes hitchhike  or walk for miles  or take buses over roads whose ruts and bumps seem designed just to torture them. In rare cases  they are rejected over and over until finally giving birth in the street  on a hospital’s steps — or in its lobby. “I threw myself on the ground ” said Evaró Chacín  32  who said her daughter was born on the lobby floor at Hospital Noriega Trigo in Maracaibo after staff there told her they couldn’t take her. “It was my husband who had to help me.” In some instances  women die. Darwin Maiquetía  37  lost his wife  Kenny Chirinos  on Jan. 20  after she developed an infection following a cesarean section in a military hospital. For years  hospitals have struggled to acquire disinfectant. “The level of anger I have is not normal ” said Mr. Maiquetía  cradling his newborn daughter  Alena  one afternoon. He chose a military hospital  he said  because he thought that in an increasingly militarized country  it would be safe. Ms. Chirinos  an avid outdoorswoman who often went rappelling on the outskirts of Caracas with her husband  was the love of his life  he said. “They’re destroying families ” he said  “destroying lives.” In other cases  families lose their children. “All the clinics said the same: We don’t have what’s necessary to care for your baby ” said Aydimar Alvarado  26  who traveled to 12 hospitals before giving birth to a little boy  Kahel  in December. Born with a mop of dark hair that nurses smoothed into a mohawk  making him look like a miniature rock star  Kahel died 10 days later. His death certificate cited prematurity  bleeding around the brain and other factors. One doctor we consulted said the conditions might have been prevented or addressed had his mother’s care not been delayed by the roulette. In his many televised speeches  the country’s president  Nicolás Maduro  has characterized the country’s health system as facing challenges but generally doing well. As recently as March  he encouraged women to “give birth  give birth ” saying that every woman “should have six children” for the good of the country. He has attributed the country’s medical supply shortage to sanctions  which President Trump has imposed to try to push Mr. Maduro out. Analysts and critics claim this assertion has only some weight. Sanctions have sometimes delayed the delivery of essentials  but the government could go through aid organizations to get what it needs  said Feliciano Reyna  founder of the Venezuelan nonprofit Action for Solidarity. One economist  Asdrúbal Oliveros  said Mr. Maduro had simply chosen to prioritize the import of oil and food over medicine  making the calculation that pregnant women and sick people don’t protest — but that hungry people do. The heads of the country’s women’s ministry and health ministry did not respond to requests for interviews. Nor did the directors at several major hospitals. After years of denying the country was in crisis  Mr. Maduro opened the door last year to humanitarian aid  and groups like the Red Cross and UNICEF began to bring in hundreds of tons of goods  including lifesaving antibiotics. But the effect has at best been palliative  in part because donations are scarce. “We put out a call for help ” said Luis Farias  of the Red Cross in Venezuela  “and it didn’t get the backing that we had hoped.” Critically  the dearth of medical supplies is colliding with the growing needs of Venezuelan women. Years into the country’s recession  a growing number of expectant mothers are grappling with crisis-related problems — like malnutrition — that heighten the risk of a complicated birth and the need for expert help. The obstetricians and pediatricians who remain have found it nearly impossible to do their work. Inside the delivery room at the public hospital in the city of La Victoria  Nataly Smith  21  climbed onto a metal birthing bed one night  shaking and alone. She wore pink lipstick and had her hair in a ponytail. Blood pooled on the floor below her. A list of missing items hung on a nearby wall: soap  gauze  trash bags. Worms had invaded the hospital’s vinyl recliners  so the beds had been banished to a nearby room. “I’m scared ” Ms. Smith whispered. At her feet was Dr. Beatriz Ticona  52  chief of the ward  in purple glasses and colorful scrubs. Dozens of her doctors had quit  she said  aghast at the conditions or desperate for higher pay. Most doctors at public hospitals make less than $10 a month  a salary that is impossible to live on. Dr. Ticona has four pediatricians to help her. She needs 18  she said. She has two respirators for babies in need  and no intensive care unit. There is one grimy bathroom for the entire maternity ward. Critically  the blood bank is often empty. That night  Ms. Smith gave birth to a healthy girl  Cristangely. But not all patients are as lucky. And when a patient dies  families sometimes come looking for someone to blame. “To find yourself in that situation where they accuse you of being an assassin ” Dr. Ticona said  “is not easy.” About three years ago  Dr. Ticona had a breakdown and had to leave the job for months. She came back out of a sense of duty. But she wondered how long she could hang on. “It gets to a point ” she said one night  “where there is so much need that you collapse.” Increasingly  pregnant women are giving up on Venezuela altogether and making the journey to neighboring Colombia  where the government has promised to pay for their health care. These women  some of whom have watched their sisters and neighbors die in childbirth back home  are a growing part of Venezuela’s exodus. Five years ago  at Hospital San José in Maicao  Colombia  just minutes from the border  doctors delivered about 70 Venezuelan children. Last year  they delivered more than 2 700. The influx has pushed the hospital to its financial limits  said Dr. Guillermo Villamil  an administrator. So far  the Colombian government has repaid the hospital less than a third of the $8 million that it has cost to help Venezuelan patients  he said  adding that he was committed to helping until the money ran out. (The office of the Colombian president  Iván Duque  said it was assessing hospital costs and how much it owed.) Though official border crossings have been closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus  pregnant women keep arriving  often traveling over dangerous  informal paths known as trochas. One day in January  a hospital cot went racing through the maternity ward of the Hospital San José. In the bed was Neryelín González  25  who had abandoned her university studies in chemistry in Venezuela and crossed the border into Colombia 10 days before  on one of those illegal paths  in search of a safe place to give birth. In the delivery room  she gave birth on a cushioned recliner covered in sanitary plastic. A clean crib waited for her baby. Two doctors and three nurses coached her through the process. “Push ” said Dr. Said Acuña. “Breathe.” Her little boy  Jhonei  was born healthy  at 6.7 pounds. “Oh my God ” she said  as doctors held him up  her anguished face twisting into a smile. “He’s out!” Later  hospital aides moved her to a clean room with air-conditioning and a shower. She changed into a white dress she had brought along. Soon  nurses entered with her baby boy and a plate of hot food. She had done it  she said. The journey had been worth it. Her child was safe  she added. And she was never going back. Sheyla Urdaneta contributed reporting from Maicao  Colombia.

Pope Francis celebrating Good Friday in an empty Saint Peter’s Square at the Vatican.Credit...Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times Supported by By Jason Horowitz Pope Francis usually joins tens of thousands of faithful at Rome’s Colosseum for a traditional Good Friday procession that solemnly evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ’s crucifixion. But on this Good Friday  like Christians all around the world  Francis is staying at home  where he will preside over a ceremony in front of an empty St. Peter’s Square. The coronavirus pandemic is forcing Christians to forgo the usual processions and sacred church services. Instead  national lockdowns have relegated participation for the faithful to following along on television or livestreams. In Jerusalem  few people stopped to kneel outside the often-packed Church of the Holy Sepulcher  built on the site where the faithful believe Jesus was crucified  buried and rose from the dead. In Spain  where deaths have surpassed 15 000  the elaborate platforms carrying religious statues in processions are gone  as are the crowds they typically draw. In Paris  some faithful watched televised services from Notre-Dame Cathedral in their living rooms. The Evangelical Berlin Cathedral marked the day with empty pews and services posted to its Facebook page. In the Philippines  the authorities canceled the procession of the centuries-old Black Nazarene statue of Jesus through Manila  although some faithful defied social distancing orders as they knelt on the way to its home in a church in the Quiapo district. In Rome  Francis was presiding under a wooden crucifix that had been carried during the city’s 16th-century plague  visiting stations around the obelisk in the center of the square before ascending the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica. Top prelates found special meaning in the fact that the weeks leading up to Easter Sunday had coincided with the outbreak of a virus that had transformed the world. The days are a “time of penance but also the time of change  of conversion  of change of heart ” said Michael Czerny  a cardinal who is close to Francis. The cardinal said that at the beginning of the season “we left the world we knew  and here we are now.” Life  the cardinal said  will eventually return. “It will be normal  but it will be a new normal ” he said. “A very new normal.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/world/10goodfriday-top/merlin_171493818_8b432f4f-da34-477b-9cfb-792e9cb930ca-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/multimedia/author-jason-horowitz/author-jason-horowitz-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/world/11virus-friday3/merlin_171467427_9324128c-5e7a-4bde-8267-77ceeacd2825-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/coronavirus-congress-china.html, us politics, China Hawks in Congress See an Opportunity in Coronavirus, Lawmakers who have long lobbied for the United States to be tougher on China are using the pandemic to press for punitive measures against Beijing., Supported by Lawmakers who have long lobbied for the United States to be tougher on China are using the pandemic to press for punitive measures against Beijing. By Catie Edmondson WASHINGTON — When Senator Marco Rubio released a report last February warning that the United States risked losing important components of its medical supply chain to China  it barely registered with most Americans. A little over a year later  as the coronavirus rips across the globe  the abstract threat has become a glaring reality with life-threatening consequences as American officials and consumers haggle with Chinese companies for lifesaving supplies like masks and tests. And Mr. Rubio  a conservative Florida Republican who has introduced a bill that aims to cut off China’s chokehold on the global pharmaceutical supply chain  now has bipartisan support for his effort  including from progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrat of Massachusetts. China hawks in Congress like Mr. Rubio  who have long pressed for a more confrontational approach to Beijing  are intensifying their efforts to enact tougher policies targeting the country. They see the coronavirus crisis as a critical opportunity to draw broader support for their push to punish and challenge China with new sanctions  mandates for domestic manufacturing and controls on American exports. “There comes a point where  as a nation  we have to ask ourselves what are the critical goods that you must retain the ability to make even if it’s not the most efficient outcome ” Mr. Rubio said. “I think that’s now right before us.” It is not clear whether any of the hard-line measures can quickly pass Congress  where lawmakers have focused most of their time so far to cobbling together government relief packages to help families and businesses weather the pandemic and its devastating economic impact. Broader attempts to reset the United States’ relationship with China will probably have to wait until the crisis abates. But those who have long railed against China’s human rights abuses and warned of its dominance over the global supply chain are taking advantage of anger about the Chinese government’s handling of the virus to make the case that it is time to take stronger action. “What the virus has done ” Mr. Rubio said  “is it has exposed longtime trends in a crisis situation.” In the weeks since the pandemic took hold in the United States  several lawmakers have unveiled legislation that would aim to unwind the two nations’ economies and blame Beijing for the spread of the virus. Even before the coronavirus pandemic emerged  Washington had made a series of aggressive moves in its competition with Beijing. But the severity of the virus has in recent weeks forced government officials worldwide to grapple with their approach to China across many fronts. Like lawmakers  some Trump administration officials have used the crisis to fuel their push to encourage American manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and reduce dependence on China for the drugs and medical products that fuel the domestic health care system. The White House trade adviser Peter Navarro  a longtime China hawk  has pressed to tighten “Buy American” laws and end exceptions allowing the government to purchase medical products from other countries. United States military officials last week called on Congress to authorize additional funding to bolster deterrence against China  a sign that many in the military expected tensions between the two nations to grow. In Japan  officials have earmarked money to help its manufacturers move production out of China in an effort to offset the disruption caused by the virus and curtail their reliance on the nation. “We would really be missing an opportunity — and frankly it would simply be a failure of leadership — if we did not take this present crisis and say  ‘Now it’s time to do something about this ’” Senator Josh Hawley  Republican of Missouri  said in an interview. Mr. Hawley last week released a three-page memo outlining policies he said should be included in the next economic stimulus package to loosen China’s hold on the global supply chain. His proposal would require that manufacturers begin to use more materials from domestic suppliers  impose crisis export controls on critical American-made equipment like ventilators  and provide investment subsidies to manufacturers to encourage them to bring their production back to the United States. “We need to put American workers in position to surge out of this ” he said. Senator Tom Cotton  Republican of Arkansas  who said the Chinese government must be held accountable for its role in the spread of the virus  has unveiled legislation that would allow Congress to impose sanctions on government officials who perform “acts intended to deliberately conceal or distort information about a public health emergency of international concern” such as the virus. It is modeled after the Global Magnitsky Act  a law designed to punish individuals around the world who are accused of human rights violations or corruption. Mr. Cotton  a hawk and one of the first lawmakers to warn of the dire effect the virus could have on the United States  is among the most vocal proponents of adopting a more adversarial relationship with China. He has also called for Congress to withhold funding from the World Health Organization  which has come under fire for what critics call its repeated deference to Beijing. “The World Health Organization is in the pocket of China ” he said on Thursday. “We’re going to have to establish our own organization and invite members of the civilized world to join us.” President Trump has expressed similar views  threatening this week to cut off funding for the W.H.O. and calling it “very China-centric.” It is not clear whether Democrats will agree with the China hawks — mostly conservative Republicans — to adopt a more aggressive stance toward Beijing. While Republican lawmakers in both the Senate and House have expressed anger at China  Democrats have been far more circumspect. Many of the most vocal lawmakers are rising stars within the Republican Party who see China as the central foreign policy focus that will shape their time in politics. That has set off fierce jockeying behind the scenes for the role of the party’s thought leader on China. Mr. Hawley  Mr. Cotton and Mr. Rubio  for example  each introduced their own versions of legislation to limit Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients in the United States’ drug supply. Bipartisan agreement has emerged in recent weeks around the urgency of that issue. The bill led by Mr. Rubio would give the Food and Drug Administration a clearer picture of how reliant drugmakers are on Chinese products. Ms. Warren  the liberal Democrat  has called it a “common sense solution.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html, us politics, Does Vote-by-Mail Favor Democrats? No. It’s a False Argument by Trump., Even some Republican officials  disagreeing with president  say that vote-by-mail has not hurt the G.O.P. in elections., Supported by News Analysis Even some Republican officials  disagreeing with president  say that vote-by-mail has not hurt the G.O.P. in elections. By Reid J. Epstein and Stephanie Saul President Trump said that if the United States switched to all-mail voting  “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” The G.O.P. speaker of the House in Georgia said an all-mail election would be “extremely devastating to Republicans.” Representative Thomas Massie  a Kentucky Republican  said universal mail voting would be “the end of our republic as we know it.” Yet leading experts who have studied voting by mail say none of that is true. As with false claims by Republicans about vote-by-mail fraud  there is no evidence to back up the argument from the right that all-mail elections favor Democrats. But Mr. Trump and some of his allies are warning that vote-by-mail poses an existential threat to their party  in hopes of galvanizing Republican opposition to a voting method that is widely seen as safer than in-person voting in the era of the coronavirus. Five states — Colorado  Hawaii  Oregon  Utah and Washington — now have all-mail elections  in which ballots are sent to every registered voter without their having to request one. Others  like Arizona and California  allow voters to add themselves to a permanent list of mail voters. And there are also cases like Nebraska  which allows counties of less than 10 000 people to mail ballots to all voters (many of them Republicans) but forbids it in large urban areas (where many voters are Democrats). Texas allows no-excuse absentee voting for people 65 or older  another group that skews Republican. None of these states have seen an appreciable shift favoring Democrats that officials and experts attribute to mail voting. Here are a few reasons. Not much that hadn’t happened before. The main argument by Mr. Trump and other Republicans is threefold: Voting by mail is easier than going to the polls; more people will vote if the process is easier; and when larger numbers of people vote  more will vote for Democrats. But in the states and counties that have transitioned to all-mail voting  there has been little evidence of partisan advantage for either side because of mail voting  said Robert Stein  a Rice University professor who has helped put in place vote-by-mail systems. Amelia Showalter  who was the data analytics director for President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign  found in deeply reported studies of all-mail elections in Colorado in 2014 and Utah in 2016 that there were very slight partisan advantages in each race. The Colorado study found that Republicans outperformed their predicted turnout in 2014 by a slightly higher margin than did Democrats. The G.O.P.’s candidate for Senate  Cory Gardner  ousted the Democratic incumbent  Senator Mark Udall  and Republicans won three of the four other statewide races on the ballot. Two years later  in Utah  Democrats gained an equally slight advantage in counties that had switched to all-mail voting. Both states saw overall turnout increase — especially among those voters considered least likely to participate in the elections. “That was a more noticeable effect among low-propensity voters ” Ms. Showalter said. “These are people who aren’t the die-hards who are going to vote in every election. They’re not going to vote in every partisan primary.” Even before the coronavirus emerged as a global threat  Democrats had generally favored ways to expand access to voting by mail  while Republicans frequently argued in favor of tightening voter identification and registration requirements  claiming without evidence that easing restrictions invited voter fraud. This wasn’t always the case. Republicans in Florida and Arizona  states with large populations of retirees  who tend to skew Republican  have pushed for years to expand vote-by-mail. Thad Kousser  the chairman of the political science department at the University of California  San Diego  said that voting by mail in California was historically seen as especially helpful to older people and rural voters  who are more likely to be Republican. He called Mr. Trump’s statements a “gross exaggeration of any partisan effect we’re likely to see.” “There are still Republicans elected in many of the areas that have voting by mail ” Dr. Kousser said. “Democrats and Republicans alike appreciate this option.” Ms. Showalter’s studies of Colorado and Utah found that mailing ballots to all voters did tend to increase turnout. And Oregon and Washington  the states that pioneered all-mail elections  have long been among the highest-turnout states in presidential elections. A 2013 study of voters in Washington by professors at Yale and the University of California  San Diego  found that voting by mail increased turnout by two to four percentage points  with low-participating voters more likely to be influenced than others. But it was impossible to tell whether those voters were Republicans or Democrats  according to one of the study’s authors  Gregory Huber  a professor of political science at Yale. “Whether the marginal nonvoter — the person induced to vote by the availability of vote-by-mail — is Democrat or Republican is less clear ” Dr. Huber said in an email  referring to voters who are ambivalent about the process and decide based on outside events. Filling out a ballot at home also affords people more time to think about their vote. Research by Dr. Stein  the Rice University professor  found that voters spent about three and a half minutes when they went to a voting booth  but took about two days to complete a ballot they had received at home. “Vote-by-mail has a way of affecting voter turnout in a way that we don’t always think about ” he said. “It increases turnout and attention for races that you would expect people would not vote for  like county judges and people you’ve never heard of.” Charles Stewart III  a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  said the evidence so far on which party benefits had been inconclusive  citing numbers from the 2016 North Carolina election showing that Republicans were more likely to vote by mail than Democrats. Ms. Showalter found the biggest turnout difference in all-mail elections came among people who were the least likely to vote. These voters tend to pay the least attention to politics and are the most ideologically flexible. In fact  all-mail voting makes some Democrats nervous. One reason is the finding in some studies that black and Latino voters — two key groups in the party’s base — are less likely to embrace mail voting than white voters. Dr. Kousser pointed to a survey of California voters that revealed differences along racial and ethnic lines in voting by mail  with black and Latino voters about five percentage points less likely to favor it than white voters. “Vote-by-mail is a little less popular as an option among Latino and African-Americans than whites and Asian-Americans ” Dr. Kousser said. “The N.A.A.C.P. has said they’re concerned about a shift to only vote-by-mail.” As for the party’s younger voters  they tend to be more transient — less likely to have a current address on file with elections authorities. “There is justified concern that Democratic-leaning voters may be disadvantaged through vote-by-mail systems ” said Brian Dunn  an Obama campaign alumnus who is a founder of Deliver My Vote  which encourages voters to sign up to receive mail ballots at home in states that allow it. “People like caregivers  gig-sector employees or those working multiple jobs may not update their address as they move  causing them to lose their ability to vote safely and easily.” This concern emerged recently during deliberations by the Maryland Board of Elections over whether to conduct the state’s June 2 primary entirely by mail. The board decided to keep a limited number of polling places open after Democratic legislative leaders  in a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan  a Republican  objected to an all-mail format  raising concerns about its potential impact on black voters. “Most vote-by-mail states are overwhelmingly white ” the letter said  then cited a 2011 study sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts that found mandatory voting by mail reduced the chances that a person would vote  particularly among urban voters  who were 50 percent less likely to vote in an all-mail election. Despite Mr. Trump’s opposition  there is ample Republican support for transitioning to mail elections. In Ohio  the state’s top Republican officials  Gov. Mike DeWine and Frank LaRose  the secretary of state  recorded a video this week promoting the state’s first all-mail elections later this month. “I reject this notion that I think comes from days gone by  when people say it’s not good for Republicans when there’s high turnout ” Mr. LaRose said in an interview on Thursday. “The highest turnout presidential election we ever had was 2016. The highest turnout gubernatorial election we ever had was 2018.” Kim Wyman  the Republican secretary of state in Washington  pushed for mail elections as a local official. She said she didn’t believe that voting by mail helped either party in her state. “There would be those who say  ‘You haven’t elected a Republican governor since 1980 in Washington ’ and our state certainly leans blue in terms of outcome ” Ms. Wyman said in an interview. “But I think if you do a deeper drive  we’re a purple state. I think a lot of those elections were won and lost with very small margins.” “When you look at states that are vote by mail  you have a mix of blue and red and states ” she said. “Utah is pretty red.” Michael Meyers  a Republican whose data firm  TargetPoint Consulting  has guided G.O.P. presidential campaigns since 2004  said Republican data and voter contact programs were superior to what Democrats had  meaning all-mail elections could be advantageous for conservatives. “Every time we do something that scares Republicans  that makes voting easier to do  we tend to freak out about it and then figure out a way to level the playing field ” Mr. Meyers said. “In some respect I think there is some advantage to it. While I am concerned about voter fraud and security  on straight mechanics  it doesn’t scare me that much.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/us/politics/09votebymail-favortism/09votebymail-favortism-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/reader-center/author-stephanie-saul/author-stephanie-saul-thumbLarge.png 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/trump-ad-gary-locke.html, us politics, New Trump Ad Suggests a Campaign Strategy Amid Crisis: Xenophobia, The ad  which calls Joe Biden soft on China and falsely suggests a former governor of Washington is Chinese  shows that President Trump plans to continue exploiting racial discord in his re-election bid., Supported by The ad  which calls Joe Biden soft on China and falsely suggests a former governor of Washington is Chinese  shows that President Trump plans to continue exploiting racial discord in his re-election bid. By Nick Corasaniti  Jeremy W. Peters and Annie Karni President Trump has kicked off his general election advertising campaign with a xenophobic attack ad against Joseph R. Biden Jr.  the presumptive Democratic nominee  the opening shot in a messaging war that is expected to be exceptionally ugly. In a minute-long digital ad released late Thursday that relies heavily on imagery of China and people of Asian descent  the Trump campaign signaled the lines of attack it will use in its attempts to rally the president’s base and define Mr. Biden. The ad reprises accusations Mr. Trump has made that the former vice president’s family profited from his relationships with Chinese officials and presents selectively edited scenes and statements attempting to portray him as doddering and weak. For the president and his allies  the approach represents their assessment of the race as it narrows into a one-on-one contest with Mr. Biden  the opponent who is least susceptible to their charges that the Democratic Party is too far outside the political mainstream. The new ad also shows that while the country has changed drastically in recent weeks amid a national health crisis  the president has not. He continues to lead the nation and run his campaign the way he always has: by belittling his adversaries and exploiting racial discord. While other presidents have used campaigns during periods of national trauma to try to unite the country  political strategists said that Mr. Trump was taking the opposite approach. “They’re just going to run a white grievance campaign ” said Stuart Stevens  who worked on the presidential campaigns of the Republicans Mitt Romney and George W. Bush. “It’s not complicated. He’s losing with everybody but white men over 50.” Mr. Stevens added. “Trump hasn’t changed ” he said. “He hasn’t changed in 30 years.” Mr. Biden amplified that criticism with a statement Friday  saying “The casual racism and regular xenophobia that we have seen from Trump and this Administration is a national scourge.” “Donald Trump only knows how to speak to people’s fears  not their better angels ” he added. Since the coronavirus started spreading in the United States  Mr. Trump has tried to steer the conversation over his response toward themes and issues he is most comfortable with like nationalism and border security. Until recently  he had been referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.” Now  with unfounded claims that Mr. Biden and his family have profited from below-board business deals with the Chinese  Mr. Trump is attempting to link his political rival to his chief geopolitical foe at a time when there is rising xenophobia and violence in the United States aimed at Chinese-Americans. “During America’s crisis  Biden protected China’s feelings ” the online ad says  presenting a montage of clips of Mr. Biden complimenting and praising the Chinese  including the country’s leader  Xi Jinping  and of a news segment accusing Mr. Biden of helping his son Hunter profit off Chinese investments. The ad also includes an image of a smiling Mr. Biden standing alongside an Asian-American man — an apparent attempt to suggest that the former president has an inappropriately cozy relationship with China. But the man in the image is a Chinese-American  the former governor of Washington  Gary Locke  who also served as President Barack Obama’s commerce secretary and ambassador to China. The picture  which appears briefly in between clips showing Mr. Biden socializing with Chinese officials and stammering through speeches  was taken at a 2013 event in Beijing where Mr. Locke and the former vice president appeared together. The ad’s implication that Mr. Biden is soft on China is oddly timed  coming as Mr. Trump’s own stance toward China and Mr. Xi has been more positive. Mr. Trump has been complimenting Mr. Xi  and as recently as last week  the president described the two of them as close allies and good friends. The Trump campaign defended using an image of an Asian-American to illustrate Mr. Biden’s ties to the Chinese  saying it was selected simply because Hunter Biden accompanied his father on the 2013 trip to China. Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused him  without evidence  of using his father’s official visit to further his own business interests. “The shot with the flags specifically places Biden in Beijing in 2013 ” Tim Murtaugh  a Trump campaign spokesman  wrote on Twitter  referring to the picture with Mr. Locke. “It’s for a reason. That’s the Hunter Biden trip. Memory Lane for ol’ Joe.” Mr. Murtaugh did not address the fact that Mr. Locke is not Chinese  or that the ad presents the image with no context or explanation. Mr. Locke responded by accusing Mr. Trump of stoking hatred against Asian-Americans. “The Trump team is making it worse ” he said in a written statement. “Asian Americans are Americans. Period.” In recent weeks  Asian-Americans have reported being physically attacked  yelled at and spit upon; organizations have begun to track the incidents. Mr. Trump’s rise has only pushed many Asian-Americans further into the Democratic Party  though they were once considered a fairly reliable Republican demographic. Some Democratic strategists said that the tone and nature of the Trump ad should serve as a wake-up call. The coronavirus pandemic and the human and economic suffering it has unleashed does not mean that politics as usual are on hiatus  they said. “This should tell the Biden campaign and every other entity trying to beat Trump that we have to rethink the playbook ” said Kelly Gibson  a Democratic media strategist who advised the campaigns of Andrew Yang and Julián Castro. “So if Democrats don’t sink to his level  at least a little  we will be at a sizable disadvantage. You can’t beat fear with logic  it has never worked and it will never work.” The Trump campaign’s approach is a coarser version of the strategy that incumbent presidents typically deploy against their opponents: try to define them early before they get a chance to define themselves. “What the Trump campaign wants to do is introduce on their terms  or in the case of Joe Biden  reintroduce that opponent to the American people before that opponent gets a chance to introduce himself ” said Ken Goldstein  a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. “Their whole campaign is going to be about disqualifying Joe Biden.” Though the ad is among the first to come from the Trump campaign directly since Mr. Biden became the presumptive nominee  an undeclared ad war has been raging for months  initially begun during the impeachment of Mr. Trump. In previous ads  including two that CNN refused to air citing “demonstrably false claims ” Mr. Trump has already attacked the Bidens on similar grounds. And since late February  Priorities USA  one of the largest Democratic super PACs  has spent $6.5 million on ads attacking Mr. Trump in key swing states; an early round featured former supporters of Mr. Trump voicing their displeasure with his administration. Priorities USA has since started airing ads starkly criticizing the president’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. In total  Democratic groups have already spent $15.5 million on general election ads this cycle  according to Advertising Analytics  an ad tracking firm. Many millions more have been spent online as well; Priorities USA alone has spent $19 million on digital attack ads already  and Acronym  another Democratic outside group  has spent $10 million. But it is unclear how much any of this advertising will matter given Americans’ preoccupation with more pressing concerns. Mr. Biden  who lacks the financial wherewithal that Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee have amassed  could stand to benefit in this regard. “The shorter the race  the more it favors the person with the least amount of money ” said Mr. Stevens  who saw firsthand in 2012 how Mr. Obama’s financial advantage and the advertising it bought made it difficult for Mr. Romney to define himself. “One of the major advantages of an incumbent president is monetary ” Mr. Stevens added. “And that’s being mitigated by this virus.” Updated April 13  2020  Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/multimedia/10trump-ad/10trump-ad-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-nick-corasaniti/author-nick-corasaniti-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-jeremy-w-peters/author-jeremy-w-peters-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/multimedia/author-annie-karni/author-annie-karni-thumbLarge.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/middleeast/osman-kavala-turkey.html, world middleeast, From Prominent Turkish Philanthropist to Political Prisoner, Acquitted in February in one trial  Osman Kavala was rearrested before he could even walk free. Now he faces indefinite jail time., Supported by The Saturday Profile Acquitted in February in one trial  Osman Kavala was rearrested before he could even walk free. Now he faces indefinite jail time. By Carlotta Gall ISTANBUL — During a tumultuous day in court in February  the Turkish businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala was unexpectedly acquitted of trying to overthrow the government and then rearrested before he could walk free. He described it as the best day of his life. “We were acquitted ” he told his lawyers  referring to the eight others tried with him. Never mind that the two years he had already spent in solitary confinement had been extended indefinitely — this time on specious charges of supporting a 2016 coup. He was happy that at least in one case  he and 15 others had been given the chance to show that the original charges against them were baseless. “Nothing can affect that composure and attitude ” Murat Celikkan  a campaigning journalist and longtime friend and colleague  said of Mr. Kavala. “I would be furious  but in all the procedures he never raised his voice once.” Mr. Kavala has become the most prominent political prisoner in Turkey  and as he himself ruefully acknowledged after his rearrest  his case is a prime example of the state of injustice in Turkey today under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His case is just one of half a million prosecutions underway amid a government crackdown since an attempted coup in 2016  but it is one of the most confounding. Best known for his good deeds  he has been variously accused of espionage  links to terrorist groups and trying to overthrow the government. Even seasoned lawyers  well used to decades of political trials in Turkey  have described the various charges against him as “ridiculous.” Mr. Kavala  63  grew up and lives in Istanbul. He comes from a family of tobacco traders who moved from the town of Kavala in northern Greece to Istanbul in the 1920s as part of the population exchange between the two countries after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. He studied management at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara and economics at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. He went on to study for his doctorate at The New School for Social Research in New York  but broke off his studies when his father died in 1982. At 26  he returned to Istanbul and took over the Kavala Group of companies. In 1988 he married Ayse Bugra  a social scientist. He soon began diversifying the family business  following his own interests. He co-founded the Iletisim Publishing Company  which became an important vehicle for democratic ideas at a time  after the military coup of 1980  when there was a dearth of democratic institutions in the country. He became increasingly interested in environmental issues and civic rights. He abandoned a hotel development in southern Turkey after watching the movie “Turtle Diary” and learning that the beach was an important nesting site for turtles. “He did it very easily ” Ms. Bugra recounted in a recent interview. “There was no hesitation.” He co-founded an environmental organization  TEMA  among others. The most troubling issue in Turkey from the late 1980s was the conflict in the southeastern part of the country between the Turkish army and Kurdish separatists  which degenerated into a brutal ethnic conflict against the Kurdish population. When the armed conflict ended a decade later  Mr. Kavala began the work that has become his lasting legacy. “We started talking about the healing powers of art and culture ” Ms. Bugra said  “and he started thinking about taking culture to different parts of Turkey.” That idea grew into the founding of Anadolu Kultur  an organization that supports arts and cultural collaboration  and takes exhibitions and performances all around the country. He supported an arts space in Diyarbakir  the biggest Kurdish city in the southeast; cultural memory projects for Yazidis  Kurds  Armenians and other minorities; and a program to encourage a normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. In between came a 1999 earthquake that killed 17 000 people and had a galvanizing effect on Turkish society. Humanitarian and civic organizations took off. “That was an important moment for the country as a whole ” Ms. Bugra said. “That was the first time we saw a civil society mobilization. It was something spontaneous.” Mr. Kavala began building temporary housing. And he became one of the leading philanthropists in the country  well known among embassies and international donors  and an energetic supporter of civic and human rights groups. Among the many organizations he helped found was the Open Society Foundation in Turkey  the organization created by the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros to support democracy and transparency around the world. The nonprofit sector flourished during Mr. Erdogan’s first decade in power from 2002  as Turkey was pursuing peace with the Kurds and instituting reforms to further its accession to the European Union. The arrival of more than three million refugees fleeing the war in Syria from 2011 was another milestone in her husband’s life  Ms. Bugra said. He was visiting the southern city of Gaziantep  working on a project for Syrian refugees in October 2017  when he was detained. Police boarded his plane in Istanbul and led him off before passengers were allowed to disembark. What has taxed Mr. Kavala and his friends the most in the 29 months since his incarceration is the question of why he has been singled out so harshly. The answer may be simply: everything he stands for. He represents the leftist-leaning  secular elite  which in Turkey’s polarized society is the opposite of the president and his supporters. They are from religiously conservative  Islamist circles that were long sidelined from power. “Osman represents another culture ” said Asena Gunal  who runs his flagship organization  Anadolu Kultur. “Someone who is open  cultured  who speaks English  can talk to foreigners  active in society. Something they see as dangerous.” As he spent 16 months in detention without knowing the charges against him  the pro-government news media and even Mr. Erdogan himself accused him of nefarious connections  including being part of a so-called Jewish conspiracy led by Mr. Soros. Some analysts say his work with Armenians and Kurds is hated by elements in Turkey’s security establishment. Others have described him as victim of an internal power struggle in Mr. Erdogan’s cabinet. “It’s really hard to see people talking about him who don’t know him ” Ms. Gunal said. “He is a nice person trying to be nice to people.” The indictment  when it was finally revealed  charged him with trying to overthrow the government by financing and organizing protests in 2013 that began as an occupy movement of Gezi Park in Istanbul’s Taksim Square to prevent the construction of a shopping mall. Mr. Erdogan  who has grown increasingly authoritarian  insists the protests were not a spontaneous social movement  as they were widely seen at the time  but an effort to oust him from power. “This is not an innocent uprising ” he told his parliamentary group the day after Mr. Kavala’s rearrest. “Behind the curtain there are those Soros-like types who meddle in some countries.” He added that he had thwarted a “maneuver” to have Mr. Kavala released. Interpreting the president’s comment  Mr. Celikkan  Mr. Kavala’s friend and colleague  said it did not bode well for Mr. Kavala. “Unless the president leaves office  dies or changes his mind  he is going to stay in prison forever ” he said. Mr. Kavala sees his case as driven by politics — in other words  Mr. Erdogan’s desire to stay in power. In answers to questions sent to him in jail through his lawyers  he said judges and prosecutors were acting in line with the political discourse. “As a result of this  legal norms are being eroded and many people are in prison unfairly ” he wrote. “As I am the lead actor in the fiction of the indictment and also the only arrested defendant of the case  I believe my situation is seen as a striking example of punishment for political reasons ” he wrote. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found in December that the Turkish courts had held him without reasonable cause. “His detention was intended to punish him as a critic of the Government ” the court concluded in a statement  “to reduce him to silence as an NGO activist and human-rights defender  to dissuade others from engaging in such activities and to paralyze civil society in the country.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/world/00profile-kavala/merlin_145476027_27ba95ba-6ec7-4c4f-9c94-f9f1ed391b25-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/multimedia/author-carlotta-gall/author-carlotta-gall-thumbLarge.png 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/middleeast/rami-aman-palestinian-activist-arrested.html, world middleeast, Zoom Call With Israelis Lands a Gaza Peace Activist in Jail, A video chat  intended to build bridges between Israeli and Palestinian strangers  led some in Gaza to label the conversation itself an act of treason., Supported by A video chat  intended to build bridges between Israeli and Palestinian strangers  led some in Gaza to label the conversation itself an act of treason. By David M. Halbfinger and Iyad Abuheweila JERUSALEM — For five years  a small but feisty group of Palestinian peace activists in the blockaded Gaza Strip has been organizing small-scale video chats with Israelis under a bridge-building initiative it calls “Skype With Your Enemy.” On Monday  the group  the Gaza Youth Committee  drew one of its biggest crowds yet — more than 200 participants — this time on Zoom  the newly popular teleconferencing platform. But other Palestinians in Gaza  who took umbrage at the idea of befriending Israelis  were also listening in. And the resulting public uproar prompted Hamas  the militant group that controls Gaza  to arrest the youth committee’s leader and several other participants. The charge: “holding a normalization activity” with Israelis  which a Hamas Interior Ministry spokesman  Iyad Al-Bozom  called a crime  saying it amounted to the “betrayal of our people and their sacrifices.” The youth committee’s leader  Rami Aman  38  has not been heard from since he surrendered Thursday morning at Internal Security headquarters in Gaza City  a family member said late Friday afternoon. Israeli journalists are barred from entering the Gaza Strip  and vice versa  so the two populations know little about one another and have almost no civilian interaction  apart from small numbers of Gaza merchants permitted to do business in Israel and of Gaza patients treated in Israeli hospitals. The nearly two-hour video chat  held in English  gave the left-leaning Israeli participants  mostly in their 20s and 30s  a rare chance to hear directly from a handful of Gaza residents about life under the 12-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade and how the coronavirus is affecting things. “Do you have music festivals? ” one Israeli asked. (That is forbidden  he was told.) But the questions quickly grew more philosophical: How can people maintain hope  a woman asked  when things get really difficult? Mr. Aman said he staved off despair by pouring himself into projects  like dancing or putting on plays with Israelis over online video  or a new plan to teach English and soccer to Gaza children eight to 10 years old. He said the youth committee’s goal was to build a new generation of leaders who believe in making peace. And he encouraged the Israelis to do the same: “Be active  guys ” he told them  urging the Israelis to run for Parliament. “Go to the Knesset  be ministers ” he said. “Let’s change the names ” he said. “Let’s create a new kind of Netanyahu  a new kind of Abu Mazen ” references to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the nickname of the Palestinian president  Mahmoud Abbas. An Israeli man asked what Israelis could do to stop people from being raised to hate. Another youth committee member  Manar Al-Sharif  responded that the best way was for Israelis and Palestinians to talk  rather than relying on the news for information about one another. Mr. Aman  who founded the youth committee 10 years ago  was asked if Hamas was aware of his actions. He noted he had been “invited” in for questioning many times  and had been held for 17 days last year after having organized an attention-getting bike ride with Israeli counterparts along both sides of the Gaza-Israel border. “They thought I’m working as a spy  maybe sending names of fighters or maps of tunnels ” he said. “Yes  it’s dangerous ” Mr. Aman acknowledged. “But we have nothing to lose.” Still  Mr. Aman said he believed he had broken a “taboo” in Gaza about communicating with Israelis. “I’m sure that if I have a speaker and speak in public in the streets — ‘Let’s talk with an Israeli’ — thousands of people would be here ” he said. As it happened  talking with Israelis remained enough of a taboo to get Mr. Aman into trouble afresh. He came in for vituperative criticism online  and early Thursday morning  a freelance Gaza journalist  Hind Khoudary  posted angry denunciations on Facebook of Mr. Aman and others on the call  tagging three Hamas officials  including Mr. Al-Bozom  to ensure it got their attention. An arrest warrant was issued by the Hamas military prosecution  which handles accused collaborators with Israel  would-be suicide bombers and other serious security threats  Mr. Al-Bozom said. He did not identify or say how many other youth committee members had also been detained. Separately  the Hamas armed wing and other militant groups issued a joint statement declaring that “normalization in all its forms and activities is treason  a crime  and religiously  nationally and morally unacceptable.” Only days earlier  the Gaza Youth Committee formally joined the Alliance for Middle East Peace  an international coalition of groups seeking to foster Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. John Lyndon  the alliance’s chief executive  said that international law enshrined the right to “seek  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” The youth committee’s work — “speaking to people right around the world about the situation in Gaza  and the need for them and the two million people living there to enjoy the freedom  peace and security that is denied to them — falls squarely within that right ” he said. There was no word late Friday about Mr. Aman’s condition. Mr. Aman’s father  reached by telephone  said he and his wife had been told to bring clean clothes for their son to the Internal Security headquarters in Gaza City. They did as instructed  he said  but were sent away without being able to see him. David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City.

Then the Clock Stopped., As the coronavirus pandemic forces soccer clubs and sponsors to tighten their belts  a women’s game poised to break out hopes it doesn’t have to bear the cost., Supported by On Soccer As the coronavirus pandemic forces soccer clubs and sponsors to tighten their belts  a women’s game poised to break out hopes it doesn’t have to bear the cost. By Rory Smith These should have been a fruitful few weeks for Glasgow City. For only the second time in its history  Scotland’s premier women’s team had secured a place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. It was scheduled to face the German powerhouse Wolfsburg on March 25. A crowd of 800  perhaps more  was expected to come through the gates of Petershill Park. Regardless of the result  Laura Montgomery  Glasgow’s general manager and one of its founders  would have been able to bank not only the revenue from ticket sales  but also the team’s share of prize money for its performance in this year’s competition. For a club like Glasgow City  run by volunteers and with a budget just a fraction of that enjoyed by the likes of Wolfsburg  it was a vital windfall. Then  early in April  would come another boost. It is around this time of year that Glasgow’s sponsorship deals come due. The invoices from the club’s partners should be starting to trickle in  providing the money not just to pay the players’ salaries but to fund the youth programs at the club’s heart. All of that income  though  is frozen. The Wolfsburg game never happened  postponed indefinitely as the coronavirus pandemic swept through world soccer. The fate of the women’s Champions League remains unclear. The question is not just when  but if  it will be played. Until a decision is made  prize money is a secondary concern for UEFA  the competition’s organizer. Montgomery  meanwhile  is not yet sure if her club’s sponsors will be willing  or able  to pay. With no games being held  she knows it is possible some may withhold their money. Others  suffering acutely themselves from the economic impact of the global shutdown  may simply not have it to give. “It is ” she said  with commendable understatement  “very challenging.” For many of Glasgow’s peers — at home and abroad — the situation is substantially more complex. Women’s soccer has boomed across Europe over the last decade  driven in part by improved performances by national teams and growing interest in Women’s World Cups and  to some extent  by the sudden  belated interest of major men’s clubs in the women’s game. The likes of Juventus and Manchester United have  in recent years  begun women’s programs  while clubs like Barcelona  Chelsea and Manchester City have invested heavily in existing teams. Interest and attendance have soared across the continent  and though wages remain low and players are often not afforded the same treatment as their male colleagues  budgets have risen  too. Paris St.-Germain spends millions of euros every year on its women’s squad  and while Chelsea made Sam Kerr the highest-paid player in England this season  its financial commitments are still outstripped by Manchester City. That money has transformed those teams — Chelsea and City  along with Arsenal  are the dominant forces in England; P.S.G. has reached two Champions League finals in the last five years — but it may also serve to make some of them vulnerable in the aftermath of the pandemic. “My biggest fear is for a lot of the women’s teams attached to another club ” Glasgow City’s Montgomery said. “We have seen before  when times are difficult  that is often the first thing that gets cut.” In England  home of Europe’s only fully professional women’s league — its 12 clubs are made up entirely of teams connected to men’s clubs  the majority of them in the Premier League — even the biggest  most successful teams run largely at a loss. In 2018  Manchester City announced an operating loss of more than a million pounds (about $1.2 million) on its women’s team  and Chelsea recorded a loss of 776 000 pounds. The same year  Arsenal confirmed it had limited its deficit to 219 000 pounds  but only because its parent club offered a cash injection of two million pounds. Even some of the continent’s richest women’s clubs  then  remain dependent — at least in part — on money diverted from their men’s teams. In some cases  that support can run at around half the budget. In the context of the elite men’s game  of course  these are meager sums: a few weeks’ salary for a squad player or a transfer fee for an academy prospect. But at a time when clubs are considering the need to cut costs to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic  it renders women’s teams vulnerable. FIFPro  the global players’ union  says it has received reports of some clubs contemplating cutting women’s and youth programs to protect their men’s first team. “The longer it goes on  the more likely clubs are to look at what costs them money ” one executive at a Women’s Super League team said. “And the women might be one of the first things to go.” That  however  is only one possible impact causing anxiety inside the women’s game. Amanda Vandervort  the chief women’s soccer officer at FIFPro  is concerned that the momentum behind the women’s game — not only attendance  but sponsorship arrangements and broadcast rights deals — could be stalled not only by the crisis  but also by the timing of it. “It is a real challenge  as it puts many of these recent developments on hold ” Vandervort said. “Women’s soccer has only recently been able to celebrate the longevity of leagues  improving wages and conditions  new tournament structures and more. Both the men’s and women’s game will have significant issues to contend with as a result of Covid-19  but on the women’s side there is great concern for the future of the teams  leagues and competitions.” The Women’s Super League  for one  was preparing to announce an international broadcasting deal for next season in the coming weeks  a significant development in its attempts to increase revenue and  as one executive put it  help clubs to “stand on our own two feet.” As long as it remains unclear when this campaign will finish  and when the next one will begin  that has had to be put on ice. It is also not clear what effect the hiatus may have on the offers for domestic television rights. Given that all sports broadcasters are facing a shortfall in advertising and subscription revenue in the wake of several sports-free months  it is likely that any future offer for women’s matches will be substantially smaller. Women’s teams have the same problems in terms of sponsorship: clubs currently negotiating arrangements with jersey sponsors for next season have had to pause their conversations as they wait to discover when they might next be able to play. “We are no longer talking in a position where we are coming off a World Cup  with all this extra interest ” one executive said. “We are coming off a crisis. It changes the dynamic.” Next season provides a further complication. In the discussions over how to finish the current European campaign — and start the next one — the needs of the men’s game appear to be under consideration first. Many in the women’s game detect that they are  at best  an afterthought. UEFA’s unilateral decision to move this summer’s European Championship back a year  dropping it into a summer already set to host the women’s event  was perhaps the most obvious slight. But the minor problems may be most illustrative. Most women’s teams have much smaller squads than their male equivalents. Many of them share stadiums with lower-ranking men’s sides. The rush to finish the men’s season in a couple of months over the summer cannot easily be replicated for the women’s equivalent. Vandervort  at least  believes the social values of women’s soccer may make it a more appealing prospect for sponsors and investors. “It can align with modern corporate values like equality and innovation ” she said. “It can and will survive any economic downturn.” Montgomery  too  is hopeful that everything she has built at Glasgow City — everything women’s soccer has built in the last two decades — will not crumble now. From the moment she established Glasgow City with her friend Carol Anne Stewart in 1998  Montgomery has run a tight ship. “You don’t have a sustainable business by spending all the money you bring in straightaway ” she said. She always made sure to ask herself  “What if disaster happens?” That approach has not stopped Glasgow from picking up 13 consecutive Scottish titles — despite increased competition  in recent years  from the women’s teams of the city’s two men’s giants  Celtic and Rangers — though Montgomery allows that it has  at times  left it overmatched in Europe. “We would go for official dinners with teams  with budgets 10 times the size of ours  who could not believe that our club was run by volunteers ” she said. She is used to working  and thriving  against the odds: having to be a better scout than professional scouts  having to be a better marketer than professional marketers. Most of all  though  she knows that her soccer club is not just about soccer. “Our core message remains the same ” she said. “It is about equality  about championing girls and women  about objecting to objectification. That’s our unique identifier. That’s what we stand for.” That appeals to brands  of course  but it also gives Glasgow City a purpose  regardless of the economic context. The club has been built  after all  on her passion  and on that of her players. “We have a few who could have gone elsewhere and earned more money ” she said. “But they stayed because our values really resonate with them.” Whatever challenges Glasgow City faces  whatever challenges women’s soccer faces  that passion  and those values  will not change. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/sports/08soccerwomen1-print/merlin_171374514_be0738ca-ab90-449c-a6d1-8556228439c6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/23/sports/Rory-Smith-better/Rory-Smith-thumbLarge.png 
08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/coronavirus-jigsaw-puzzles.html, business, Here’s How Those Hot Jigsaw Puzzles Are Made, , The coronavirus has sent businesses racing as demand surges past levels seen at Christmas. Credit...Joe Lingeman for The New York Times Supported by By Amie Tsang Patrick Stewart once called the world of jigsaw puzzles a “secret society.” There were always high-profile fans  like Hugh Jackman  but most only whispered about their passion. Now  with much of the world under lockdown and looking to kill time  jigsaw puzzles have taken on new role: a tool to save humanity. Australia’s prime minister  Scott Morrison  even referred to jigsaws as essential  and allowed people to leave the house to buy them. Celebrities and commoners  stuck in their homes  have shown off their puzzles. Ellen DeGeneres recorded her travails with a 4 000-piece puzzle on Instagram. The rush to get hold of a jigsaw puzzle — and even stockpiling by regular enthusiasts — has transformed this quiet hobby and put companies under pressure as demand surges past Christmas levels. Ravensburger  a German puzzle maker with global sales of about $600 million  has been trying to meet the sudden blizzard of orders even as social-distancing measures have limited the number of puzzles it is able to produce at its factory in the south of Germany. The company can’t easily ramp up production  because each new puzzle takes weeks to create. Each puzzle piece must be uniquely shaped  to avoid one accidentally fitting into the wrong place. That means 1 000 different shapes for a 1 000-piece puzzle  each drawn by hand by workers. Before a puzzle is cut for the first time  each piece is sketched on a sheet of paper draped over the finished image. Pieces of metal are then shaped to form an elaborate cookie cutter made just for that jigsaw puzzle; it takes about four weeks to build one. The cutter can be used only a limited number of times before its edges are dulled. It can be resharpened once and must then be discarded. At busy times of the year  the company will go through several cutters a day. But before any pieces are cut  the company chooses the right image for a puzzle. “Very rarely does it work well to just take a good-looking image and put it on a puzzle package ” said Filip Francke  the chief executive of Ravensburger in North America. People tend to prefer images jam-packed with details  instead of broad swaths of color — unless they want to torture themselves with a one-color puzzle. “We’re looking at an immersive image that allows you as the puzzler to kind of get transported into a different place  potentially even time ” said Thomas Kaeppeler  president of Ravensburger in North America. “Picture that beach scene.” Images that evoke a sense of coziness (or “hygge”) are always popular. But interests will vary by age. One British company  Gibsons  has a line of puzzles targeted at millennials that feature avocados. Ravensburger runs focus groups and monitors platforms like Reddit  Instagram and Etsy to identify trends. It creates a profile of a target customer and assembles a visual mood board that represents the kind of person the customer is and what else that person might like; a designer works with an artist to create an image. Once the image is pasted onto cardboard and the pieces are designed  the cookie cutter is laid on top and 1 000 metric tonnes  or about 1 100 tons  of pressure is applied. Half the world — about four billion people — is now under some sort of order to stay in their homes. Retailers have been scrambling to deal with the sudden demand for puzzles. Older residents of Britain  who have been urged to quarantine for 12 weeks  have started stocking up. The surge is a “double-edged sword” for companies that usually make the bulk of their sales around Christmas  said Charles King  the director at Jigsaw Puzzles Direct in northeast England. Mr. King fretted about maintaining customer service as his inventory ran low. He was trying to fulfill thousands of orders a day. Many of his customers are older people — “the gray pound ” he said. “You’re worried about a lot of your customers.” Joe Rushton  the director of Yorkshire Jigsaw  another retailer in the north of England  said he had stopped taking orders on Amazon and was just focusing on direct sales. The company has been receiving a month’s worth of orders each day  and is “pretty much cleaned out” until more puzzles come in. Many retailers said customers were calling and saying they would take whatever was available. “It almost feels like a war footing ” Mr. Rushton said.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/apple-google-coronavirus-contact-tracing.html, technology, Apple and Google Team Up to ‘Contact Trace’ the Coronavirus, The technology giants said they would embed a feature in iPhones and Android devices to enable users to track infected people they’d come close to., Supported by The technology giants said they would embed a feature in iPhones and Android devices to enable users to track infected people they’d come close to. By Jack Nicas and Daisuke Wakabayashi OAKLAND  Calif. — In one of the most far-ranging attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus  Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it. The technology giants said they were teaming up to release the tool within several months  building it into the operating systems of the billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world. That would enable the smartphones to constantly log other devices they come near  enabling what is known as “contact tracing” of the disease. People would opt in to use the tool and voluntarily report if they became infected. The unlikely partnership between Google and Apple  fierce rivals who rarely pass up an opportunity to criticize each other  underscores the seriousness of the health crisis and the power of the two companies whose software runs almost every smartphone in the world. Apple and Google said their joint effort came together in just the last two weeks. Their work could prove to be significant in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Public-health authorities have said that improved tracking of infected people and their contacts could slow the pandemic  especially at the start of an outbreak  and such measures have been effective in places like South Korea that also conducted mass virus testing. Yet two of the world’s largest tech companies harnessing virtually all of the smartphones on the planet to trace people’s connections raises questions about the reach these behemoths have into individuals’ lives and society. “It could be a useful tool but it raises privacy issues ” said Dr. Mike Reid  an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California  San Francisco  who is helping San Francisco officials with contact tracing. “It’s not going to be the sole solution  but as part of a robust sophisticated response  it has a role to play.” Timothy D. Cook  Apple’s chief executive  said on Twitter that the tool would help curb the virus’s spread “in a way that also respects transparency & consent.” Sundar Pichai  Google’s chief  also posted on Twitter that the tool has “strong controls and protections for user privacy.” With the tool  people infected with the coronavirus would notify a public health app that they have it  which would then alert phones that had recently come into proximity with that person’s device. The companies would need to get public-health authorities to agree to link their app to the tool. President Trump said on Friday that his administration planned to look at the tool. “It’s very new  new technology. It’s very interesting ” he said. “But a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person’s freedom.” Privacy is a concern given that Google  in particular  has a checkered history of collecting people’s data for its online advertising business. The internet search company came under fire in 2018 after it said that disabling people’s location history on Android phones would not stop it from collecting location data. Apple  which has been one of the biggest critics of Google’s collection of user data  has not built a significant business around using data to sell online advertising. Still  the company has access to a wealth of information about its users  from their location to their health. There are already third-party tools for contact tracing  including from public health authorities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In March  the government of Singapore introduced a similar coronavirus contact-tracing app  called TraceTogether  that detects mobile phones that are nearby. But given the number of iPhones and Android devices in use worldwide  Apple and Google said they were hoping to make tracing efforts by public health authorities more effective by reaching more people. They also said they would provide their underlying technology to the third-party apps to make them more reliable. Daniel Weitzner  a principal research scientist at M.I.T.’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and who was one of those behind the school’s contract tracing app  said Google and Apple’s partnership will help health officials save time and resources in developing their own applications to track the virus’ spread. One challenge for third-party apps is that they must run constantly — 24 hours a day  seven days a week — to be effective. Google said some Android smartphone manufacturers shut down those applications to save battery life. Apple and Google said their tool would also constantly run in the background if people opt to use it  logging nearby devices through the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth. But it would eat up less battery life and be more reliable than third-party apps  they said. Once someone reports his or her infection to a public-health app  the tool will send the phone’s so-called broadcast beacons  or anonymous identifiers connected to the device  to central computer servers. Other phones will constantly check those servers for the broadcast beacons of devices they had come near in the past 14 days. If there is a match  those people will receive an alert that they had likely come into contact with an infected person. Apple and Google said they were discussing how much information to include in those alerts with health officials  aiming to strike a balance between being helpful while also protecting the privacy of those who have the coronavirus. “This data could empower members of the general population to make informed decisions about their own health in terms of self-quarantining ” said Dr. Reid. “But it doesn’t replace the public health imperative that we scale up contact tracing in the public health departments” around the world. Apple and Google said they would make the tool’s underlying technology available to third-party apps by mid-May and publicly release the tool “in the coming months.” The companies said the tool would not collect devices’ locations — it only tracked proximity to other devices — and would keep people anonymous in the central servers. Google and Apple’s approach aims to resolve one of the hurdles facing government and private efforts to create contact tracing applications: a lack of common technical standards. The European Commission  the executive of the 27-nation bloc  said on Wednesday that “a fragmented and uncoordinated approach risks hampering the effectiveness” of such apps. Ashkan Soltani  an independent cybersecurity researcher  cautioned that surveillance tools that start as voluntary often become required through public policy decisions. China  for instance  has introduced a color-coded coronavirus surveillance app that automatically decides whether someone must stay at home or may go outside and use public transportation. “The danger is  as you roll out these voluntary solutions and they gain adoption  it’s more likely that they are going to become compulsory ” said Mr. Soltani  a former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. Soltani said the tool could also be a way for the tech companies to pre-empt efforts by governments in the United States or elsewhere to mandate a more invasive collection of data to combat the pandemic. “The tool permits them to address the administration’s ask to ‘do something’ while also relieving them of the responsibility of building the app and collecting the data themselves ” he said.

A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/business/10Jpvirus-applegoogle1-print/merlin_171347076_d6daaf50-fe4c-4af7-bf12-f749b8da294d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/multimedia/author-jack-nicas/author-jack-nicas-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/multimedia/author-daisuke-wakabayashi/author-daisuke-wakabayashi-thumbLarge.png 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/arts/comic-books-coronavirus.html, arts, Can Comic Books Survive the Coronavirus Era?, A key distributor has halted deliveries and shops are shuttered  putting the entire industry in jeopardy: “A lot of people are going to lose their livelihoods.”, Supported by A key distributor has halted deliveries and shops are shuttered  putting the entire industry in jeopardy: “A lot of people are going to lose their livelihoods.” By Dave Itzkoff Comic-book superheroes are used to finding themselves in life-or-death situations and fighting back against seemingly impossible odds. But who can they turn to when comic books themselves are imperiled? Like every other business that has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic  comic-book publishing — a wellspring of material for countless hit films and TV shows — is in considerable jeopardy. In recent weeks  the industry has been throttled at every juncture. Comic-store owners have shuttered their shops and the distribution of new titles has been frozen. Writers and artists continue to produce work  not knowing how or when readers will be able to see it. The dollars at stake are substantial: in recent years  sales of comics and graphic novels in the United States and Canada have topped $1 billion annually  with printed comic books accounting for more than a third of that figure  according to an analysis by Comichron and ICv2  sites that track the comic business. Digital sales contribute about $100 million to that total. But now  neither the people who make comic books nor the veteran observers of this industry see a quick solution; they cannot predict whether the current calamity will eradicate only some stores and publishers or an entire  decades-old model of doing business. “I do think this is an extinction-level event ” said Heidi MacDonald  editor of The Beat  a comics culture website. “It’s life-changing for everyone. This is a whole industry that lived on very thin margins. There’s no port in this storm.” Publishers of every size recognize that they are at risk. Dan Buckley  the president of Marvel Entertainment  which is home to Spider-Man  the X-Men and the Avengers  said in a statement  “This crisis is having an unprecedented impact on every aspect of our lives and requires patience and perseverance ” adding that he remained optimistic that comics “are here to stay.” The proprietors of comic shops across the country say that what once looked like a promising year of business has evaporated amid state-by-state policies that have required the closure of their stores. “I went from thinking about giving myself a bonus to not paying myself ” said Rod Lamberti  who runs Rodman Comics in Ankeny  Iowa. “Now the worst-case scenario has happened.” Mike Sterling  who operates Sterling Silver Comics in Camarillo  Calif.  said he saw “an enormous surge of business” just before a statewide shelter-in-place order went into effect there in late March. “I don’t know if people just wanted to build up a stockpile of comics to read at home or there was a general sense of unease driving a need for more escapism ” said Sterling  adding that phone-in sales remained strong for several days after he locked his doors. But these stores were dealt a further blow when Diamond Comic Distributors  the company that supplies them with the comic books and graphic novels of most major publishers  announced that it would stop shipping new comics to stores beginning April 1. Diamond has also been making deferred payments to publishers and other vendors from which it buys the merchandise that is sold to stores. Calls to Diamond’s offices in Maryland were not returned. But in a statement on the company’s website  Steve Geppi  its founder  wrote that Diamond’s “publishing partners are also faced with numerous issues in their supply chain  working with creators  printers and increasing uncertainty when it comes to the production and delivery of products ” adding that its own freight networks and distribution centers were under significant strain. In his statement  Geppi encouraged retailers to “let loose your own creativity” as they try to sell merchandise already in stock. Sterling said the loss of new merchandise at stores like his “breaks the chain all the way around.” “I can’t make money  so Diamond can’t make money off me  and then the publishers can’t make money off Diamond ” he said. Though most comic books are available in digital formats  many fans value the experience of visiting stores in person  browsing the racks and soliciting the opinions of other readers. G. Willow Wilson  who writes the fantasy series The Dreaming: Waking Hours for DC and the science-fiction epic Invisible Kingdom for Dark Horse  said that shops were an important social hub. Unlike other media that people have grown accustomed to consuming at home  she said “comics still rely on actual stores and the communities they provide.” “We are now deprived of those gathering places ” she said. “The loss of that community has been really disruptive to people.” Other writers and illustrators say they are going forward with the work they were already engaged in before the pandemic and trusting that their titles will eventually be published on schedule  more or less. “For me  little has changed ” said Greg Capullo  a veteran comics artist who is drawing the coming DC series Dark Nights: Death Metal. “I’m just proceeding as if all of our release dates are going to go off as planned. Whether that ends up being the case or not I guess remains to be seen.” Chris Eliopoulos  an artist and founder of Virtual Calligraphy  a studio that handles lettering and other production duties for Marvel  said that his company has not yet seen a slowdown in work. “Editors and freelancers have been doing their jobs and we’ve been getting pages in ” Eliopoulos said. “I’ve been one of the lucky ones and I haven’t felt any major repercussions at this time  but I’m sure it’s going to happen. I’m sure we’re going to feel it in a week or so.” Indeed  Newsarama  a website that covers the comics industry  reported that Marvel was pausing work on about 15 to 20 percent of the titles it intended to publish in May and June. (A spokesman for Marvel confirmed this report.) Whatever the outcome of all this upheaval  no one expects Marvel or rival DC  which publishes the adventures of Superman  Batman and Wonder Woman  to fall by the wayside. Though their parent companies  Disney (which owns Marvel) and AT&T (which owns DC)  have sustained steep financial losses during the pandemic  these imprints are viewed as crucial pipelines of superhero characters and story lines that can be adapted into television shows and blockbuster films. “They are relatively cheap research-and-development departments for some big movies and TV shows ” said Rich Johnston  founder and head writer of the comics news site Bleeding Cool. “They generate all this intellectual property and if you pick up a comic book  you’ve got all the design done for you.” Whether their smaller competitors can also ride out the months ahead remains uncertain. “What you might end up seeing is a feeding frenzy where bigger companies jump in and start buying up stuff — distributors  printers  publishers — on the cheap ” Johnston said. He added  “In the meantime  a lot of people are going to lose their livelihoods.” For now  some shop owners are sustaining themselves through mail-order and eBay sales of graphic novels  anthologies and collectible back issues. Some have also benefited from online fund-raisers held by celebrity artists or from organizations like the Book Industry Charitable Foundation  which provide emergency relief. (DC said it is donating $250 000 to this foundation.) While these retailers await a solution to their distribution roadblock  they also fear that dedicated customers who go in each Wednesday to satisfy their weekly craving for new comics will be broken of this habit and won’t return to stores. “Maybe at some point I can open my doors again ” said Ryan Liebowitz  who runs Golden Apple Comics in Los Angeles. “But if they’ve been sitting at home without buying new comic books for two  three months  they might go  ‘Eh  it was fun for a while but I don’t really need them anymore.’ Maybe they’ve re-evaluated what’s important to them.” Brian Michael Bendis  the writer of several DC titles  including its flagship Superman and Action Comics series  said that although “things are very up in the air on almost every conceivable level ” the industry would eventually right itself as it has after past catastrophes. Recalling the period after 9/11  when he wrote for Marvel  Bendis said  “I very specifically remember feeling and being told that we might be done  totally. And then three weeks later it all bounced back. I think something similar will happen here. We’re going to figure out how to fix this and get back to work.” Now  as his social media fills with memes and cartoons depicting doctors and nurses in Superman costumes or showing the Man of Steel paying homage to medical personnel  Bendis said  “It’s a constant reminder of what the iconography means and what the character means.” Moments like that  he said  were also illustrations of why comic books and the characters they chronicle were bound to survive. “It’s a very simple  literary equation ” Bendis said. “That’s someone who is trying to be their best self. That’s what he’s about. Let’s all try to be that  too.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/arts/00comic-book-industry1/00comic-book-industry1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-dave-itzkoff/author-dave-itzkoff-thumbLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/multimedia/03-Parenting-screentime/03-Parenting-screentime-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/travel/13coronavirus-52-promo/13coronavirus-52-promo-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/realestate/13virus-quarantine/13virus-quarantine-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/arts/13livestreaming-art/13livestreaming-art-mediumThreeByTwo210-v3.jpg 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/arts/virus-quarantine-clapping.html, arts, In Praise of Quarantine Clapping, The highlight of my day — every day — is opening my window and yelling at the sky., Supported by Critic’s Notebook The highlight of my day — every day — is opening my window and yelling at the sky. By Amanda Hess Every night at 7  my Brooklyn neighborhood comes to life with the calculated whimsy of a cuckoo clock. It starts with a single neighbor clapping. Soon dozens more join in  throwing open their front doors or hanging from their windows to put their hands together and say “wooooo.” Perhaps 20 seconds into the proceedings  a man emerges from the garden apartment across from me  banging a pot with a spoon  and a woman appears on the stoop of the house next door  her spaniel barking helpfully at her side. Often there is a special guest: On a recent evening  a guy motored by on a delivery bike  a whistle blaring from between his lips. It’s all over within five minutes. The Clapping first spread through New York City on a Friday night in late March. Following similar gestures in Italy  India and Spain  the New York iteration was seeded by a strategic marketing firm and circulated over social media to thank workers on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak. It was originally presented as a one-off event  and after that  residents were asked to repeat it once a week. But now we do it every single night. The Clapping has surely been heard by doctors and nurses and E.M.T.s  by UPS workers and Instacart delivery people and the many other New Yorkers who are putting themselves at risk to protect their city. I live just a couple of blocks from the choked I.C.U. of the Brooklyn Hospital Center  and on Tuesday  firefighters lined up right outside the center to cheer the staff on. But the more the ritual is repeated  the more it feels as if it’s for the rest of us  too. We used to go out to concerts or movies or plays and clap for the performances. Now the clapping is the performance. It is our regularly scheduled programming  live and in person when basically nothing else is. Thanking health care workers may be the point of this act  but its delights lie beside the point. The Clapping is a communal outburst. It is a reminder that though we are isolated  we are not alone. It is made up of a hundred little improvisations that nevertheless add up to a comfortingly predictable cacophony  tailored to the street where you live. In some neighborhoods  the Clapping manifests as a sparse pattering  and in others it echoes between high-rise apartment complexes  producing walls of sound. On a recent night in Stuyvesant Town  the Clapping was punctuated by clanging bells and hoots from horn instruments; on the Lower East Side  somebody blasted out Sinatra singing “New York  New York.” I’m told that some blocks do not clap at all. It’s a cliché to describe a performance as “life-affirming ” but here the description feels true. I like it for smaller reasons  though. Like many New Yorkers  I don’t know most of my neighbors  and I’ve found myself using these few minutes every night to gather clues to their domestic lives. I notice who emerges from sprawling multistory brownstones and who from apartment buildings. One night the man with the pot was joined by a companion banging her own kitchenware. Another time  the spaniel failed to appear  and I reveled in my exaggerated disappointment. Did the dog have a previous engagement? There are those who choose to abstain from the Clapping  and those who actively campaign against it. The British right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins  who is whiling away her quarantine standing in front of a poster of the American flag and ranting into her webcam  has criticized the applause in England as a foolish hobby. She called it “clapping at the sky ” which is an accidentally lovely way of putting it. Others argue that the Clapping is an empty gesture  accomplishing nothing for the workers who are most at risk. And yet even for the critics the Clapping is a kind of gift; it gives them a performance to pan. It’s true that on the internet  the ritual can appear flattened into a self-satisfied show. On Twitter  I watched the queasy corporate spectacle of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco light up with a video of clapping hands. The hashtag #ClapBecauseWeCare distorts the experience to fit the contours of a social media awareness campaign; it oversells the purpose of the event and makes it all feel a little smug. As social distancing has migrated all of our human interactions online  the Clapping has revealed the limits of the medium. Experiences let loose on the internet risk being swiftly mined for their utility to the platform  reduced to mere carriers of information capable of accumulating commentary and debate. I can understand why people feel compelled to share videos of the Clapping  as it is perhaps the most thrilling non-horrifying event that a quarantined New Yorker can document on any given day. But watching the Clapping in other neighborhoods feels pointlessly remote  like eavesdropping on a conversation in a language you don’t understand. You kind of have to be there — and you only get to be there if you’re already there. Clappers may have learned of the ritual through a Facebook post or a message chalked on the pavement of a neighborhood park. But it persists because we hear it  and we want to keep hearing it. Some days it is the only thing I hear from outside that is not an ambulance siren. Every night as the Clapping hour approaches  my body is alert with anxious anticipation. Will we clap again tonight? So far  the answer has been yes. With each day  it feels more likely that we will stop only once the virus does. Until then  I’ve got nowhere else to be.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/asia/coronavirus-migrants.html, world asia, Coronavirus Finds Fuel in a World of Migrants, Migrant workers have not only been victims of Covid-19  but spreaders  too  creating a new world of risk for a vulnerable population., Supported by Migrant workers have not only been victims of Covid-19  but spreaders  too  creating a new world of risk for a vulnerable population. By Hannah Beech BANGKOK — His whole family back in Myanmar depended on him. But Ko Zaw Win Tun  one of an estimated four million migrant workers in Thailand  lost his job at a Bangkok toy store when the city went into a coronavirus lockdown. With little hope of a new job there  Mr. Zaw Win Tun  24  joined the crowds of workers rushing home to Myanmar  traveling by packed bus  plane and car to reach his hometown  Kyaukme  in the country’s north. The morning after he returned  the fever set in. A test for the coronavirus came back positive. The coronavirus spread early through international travelers: tourists  worshipers  conference attendees and members of the business elite. But nearly 200 million migrant workers also travel across national borders  according to the International Labor Organization. About 760 million more move within their countries  more than 40 million in India alone. Lacking basic rights and marooned in unfamiliar places  migrant workers are usually the first in the labor force to be hit by an economic downturn. Now  as the coronavirus disease  Covid-19  spreads across the globe  migrant workers are not only victims but vectors  too  taking the epidemic to villages ill-equipped to deal with a health crisis. “When the virus attacks people who are vulnerable like me  I feel like there is no help for us ” Mr. Zaw Win Tun said from his hospital bed. Late last month  the Myanmar government said it would close its borders with Thailand to stem the virus from invading the country. The proposed lockdown  though  had the opposite effect  as panicked migrants rushed home. At one border crossing  30 000 people descended in a single day  according to rights groups. The same thing happened in Afghanistan  which shares a long  porous border with Iran. With Iran’s economy collapsing as it was hit early and hard by the coronavirus  as many as 15 000 Afghan laborers streamed back home a day  spreading the virus around the country. Government officials  as well as Taliban insurgents who control parts of the country  attempted makeshift contact tracing. The governor of northern Faryab Province  Naqibullah Faiq  ordered an investigation of the first migrant returning from Iran who brought the virus back with him. The results were sobering. “If you follow the chain ” Mr. Faiq said  “it could reach 1 000 people.” Even as these communities have been sustained by remittances from overseas workers  they have also greeted potentially infected laborers with suspicion. In India  when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an imminent nationwide lockdown last month  hundreds of thousands of internal migrants scrambled to return home as their jobs evaporated overnight. Anil Singh  a laborer  heard about the lockdown on television and crammed blankets in a backpack and filled three plastic bags with his children’s clothes. Over three days  his family of five walked and hitched truck rides for the 265-mile journey home to the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Along the way  they were forced to squat with hundreds of others for hours  as the police moved a long stream of migrants through checkpoints. No social distancing occurred. When Mr. Singh and his family finally made it to their village of Damoh  the indignities continued. Old friends shunned them  telling them they should shelter in nearby farmland rather than in the village. “When villagers pass by my house  they shout  ‘You are carrying disease!’” Mr. Singh  36  said. “Earlier they used to respect us for working in the city. Now that has become a curse for us.” In the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh  returning migrants were forced to kneel while the authorities used hoses to spray them with corrosive disinfectant. More than a dozen died in the chaos of the lockdown. In the Philippines  where more than 10 percent of the population works overseas  most returning migrants were not screened for the coronavirus  even if they were coming from places with known viral outbreaks. Nearly 4 500 cruise ship employees have returned to the Philippines  some from ships that teemed with the virus. But unless they showed symptoms  these seafarers were never tested  said Joanna Concepcion  the chair of Migrante International  which works to protect the rights of overseas workers. “Many are fearful that they may be carriers as they return home to their families ” Ms. Concepcion said. At least 525 Filipino workers have contracted the disease overseas  according to the foreign department. About 50 have died. The crowded conditions in which migrants live and work serve as breeding grounds for contagion. In Singapore  construction sites and dormitories for foreign workers have become hot spots of the coronavirus  with more than 400 people infected. The largest single cluster of cases is in one such dormitory  provoking concern that Singapore  while having been applauded for its virus-containment strategy early on  has seen disease fester in some of its poorer communities. The government has responded by quarantining migrants in four dormitories that can hold about 50 000 people. Conditions are dire  with a dozen to a room  sharing often-filthy toilets. Unlike many other countries  Singapore  an island city-state  does not depend on undocumented workers. Its roughly one million low-wage migrant workers  in a nation of 5.5 million residents  are legal and theoretically afforded the same basic labor rights as Singaporean citizens. Those being quarantined in the dormitories are being provided meals although it’s not clear who will eventually pay for them. Nevertheless  isolating so many people in such cramped quarters could facilitate the rapid transmission of disease  just as happened on cruise ships  rights groups warned. “Quarantining people en masse  packed in like sardines in these dormitories  is to potentially sacrifice these foreign workers for those outside the barrier ” said Alex Au  the vice president of Transient Workers Count Too  a labor rights group. “Is that something we want to do as a society?” Singapore’s long reliance on a vast underclass of cheap labor from places like India  China  Bangladesh and Myanmar has discomfited some Singaporeans. Tommy Koh  a former high-ranking diplomat  posted on his Facebook account about the “disgraceful” conditions that migrant laborers endure. “The way Singapore treats its foreign workers is not First World but Third World ” he wrote. Mr. Au said that the coronavirus would almost certainly galvanize Singapore’s efforts to use automation to replace certain low-income jobs. The city-state has been experimenting  for instance  with driverless public transportation. But most countries don’t have the resources of a place like Singapore  which is among the world’s richest. Without adequate opportunities at home  migrants will still go to where the jobs are  even at the risk of disease. Rakesh Kumar  a construction worker in New Delhi  said that as he set off for his home in Uttar Pradesh  his next meal was foremost on his mind  not some invisible virus that might have been carried by another migrant squeezed in with him on the bus. “Now we are living in a situation where hundreds of thousands of people could be going to bed hungry ” he said. “The rich will always save themselves but disease always hits the poor and leaves them devastated.” Reporting was contributed by Saw Nang from Mandalay  Myanmar; Sameer Yasir from New Delhi; Najim Rahim and Mujib Mashal from Kabul  Afghanistan; and Jason Gutierrez from Manila. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

By Adam Nossiter CLICHY-SOUS-BOIS  France — The young men  immigrants with no papers and nowhere to go  chatted at close quarters outside the shopping strip  social distancing be damned. Above loomed the shabby facade of one of France’s most notorious housing blocks  packed with families waiting out confinement. The pain of the moment is concentrated in this dense  impoverished district of the Paris immigrant suburbs  one of four French areas  including Paris and Alsace  hit by “an exceptional excess” of coronavirus deaths  France’s national health director said this week. Much of Paris — perhaps a quarter of the population — packed up and went off to the countryside when the French government announced strict confinement rules on March 16. But just across the line in Seine-Saint-Denis  France’s poorest department  people didn’t have that choice. Inside the Paris city limits  the streets are now as quiet as any French provincial town on a Sunday; in the suburbs the streets are mostly empty too. But the apartments are full. The grim and tired faces of the residents  lining up to get into the post office or the supermarket in the worn shopping strip  tell the story: small public housing apartments packed with families  jobs that have disappeared and an aggressive police force clamping down on youth restless with the confinement rules. The combination of cramped quarters  acute economic stress and tough policing has made Paris’s poorer suburbs a more dangerous place for the virus to spread  as well as a special source of tension during the epidemic. Relations between residents and the police  with their undercurrent of racial discrimination  are often fraught even in the best of times  and the current lockdown is not one of them. Over and over  residents compared the confinement rules to conditions in a prison  and they charged that the police were taking advantage of their mandate to keep the streets clear by harassing  even beating  youths  no questions asked. Some are warning that the pressures are ripe to explode. “We’ve got a lot of young people in big families  shut up in tiny apartments  and it’s difficult to close them up like that ” said Bilal Chikri  a filmmaker who lives in the neighborhood. “There’s a lot of clashes with the police  lots of police missteps  lots of abuse of power.” The approach has left residents vulnerable to both the police and the virus. Paris had 732 virus deaths compared with 402 in Seine-Saint-Denis as of April 8  but the city has half again the population of the suburb  where many of the metropolis’s cashiers  deliverymen  transit workers  nurses and couriers live. “This is getting really tough ” said Larry Karache  an out-of-work shopkeeper  standing outside Chêne Pointu  the housing project where France’s 2005 urban riots were born  and which was depicted in last year’s hit film “Les Misérables.” “We’re actually in prison here.” “People can’t support their families anymore ’’ he added. “And with the cops now  it’s all about score-settling.” The stresses  from a lack of money and small spaces  were accumulating. “It’s like a prison. There are three of us in two rooms ” said Drissa Fofana  an out-of-work construction worker. “But we’ve got to accept it. If this goes on  the little that we’ve got saved up will be all gone ” he said. Another resident  Mama Traoré  echoed the complaint. “It’s hard ” she said  grimacing as she bent over her shopping cart outside the post office at Chêne Pointu. “I’ve got four kids and three rooms. Too small. With all the noise  I’ve always got a headache.” Outside the apartment blocks  small groups gather  here and there  mostly at bus stops. But the wide streets are largely quiet. “On the whole  people are respecting the confinement rules ” said Hamza Esmili  a sociologist who has studied the Paris suburbs. “There isn’t a sort of collective indiscipline about it.” “But the illness has the potential to continue spreading ” Mr. Esmili warned. The real danger comes not from people congregating outside  but from the cramped apartments where extended families are packed. “On the exterior  the confinement is being observed ” said Frédéric Adnet  head of emergency services in the Seine-Saint-Denis department. “It’s not there that the problem is playing out.” “We’re seeing whole families arrive in the emergency rooms ” he said. “There’s familial contamination. People live  five or six  in little  little apartments.” Paris had its exodus to country homes. “We didn’t see that in the Seine-Saint-Denis ” Mr. Adnet said. “They don’t have country homes here. So we didn’t benefit from that drop in the population.” In the last few days the pressure on the area’s three public hospitals has eased a little  officials said. But the tension inside the tired old apartment blocks is spilling into the streets. The French police have come down hard  in the accounts of several residents  responding to perceived lapses in the confinement rules with beatings  harassment  humiliation and intimidation. A coalition of rights groups  including Human Rights Watch  denounced “unacceptable and illegal behavior” by the police in the Paris suburbs in a March 27 statement  saying the health crisis “doesn’t mean a break with the rule of law and doesn’t justify discriminatory checks or unjustified force.” It noted that these abuses “are common  and rarely punished” in France. A leading police union  in a post on Twitter  called the residents’ accounts “fables ” and blamed them on “little Dzerjinskis” — a reference to a celebrated Bolshevik revolutionary — who are “holed up in the Latin Quarter  or their country homes.” But the accounts are consistent  widespread and tied to the French government’s confinement rules. Since March 17 authorities have demanded a self-signed interior ministry release form giving one of four preapproved reasons for being outside. In the Paris suburbs  if the police catch you without the form  or if there is an error on it  you are in trouble  residents said. “The police just jump in  just like that  with force ” said Fiston Kabunda  who works as a mediator for the city of Clichy-sous-Bois. “There’s no discussion.” “It’s an abuse of power: ‘We’re going to beat up some black and Arab ’” he added. “Look  it’s like this: The police come  and they start to beat up on the kids ” he said. “They’re not even checking them. It’s brutality  no questions asked.” A spokesman for the police prefecture of Paris  which is responsible for Seine-Saint-Denis  said the police would not comment on accusations that were “not specific.” Mr. Chikri  the filmmaker  said he had forgotten his release form in his car when a group of police surrounded him last week  threw him to the ground  handcuffed him  kicked him and squeezed his carotid artery. “You can stuff your release form ” the police told him  Mr. Chikri recalled. “With these guys  it’s all hatred and violence ” he said. The police in Paris did not respond to a specific inquiry about Mr. Chikri’s accusations. In a video widely circulating on French social media  a young man in the suburb of Les Ulis can be heard screaming in pain during a police “check” for a missing release form. “He was savagely beaten with truncheons  fists and kicks until he fell to the ground  but the punishment continued ” said a criminal complaint filed on behalf of Sofiane Naoufel El Allaki  a 21-year-old deliveryman for Amazon  by a Paris human rights lawyer  Samim Bolaky. “The screams of Mr. El Allaki penetrated the whole neighborhood ” the complaint said. “This is not about confrontation ” Mr. Bolaky said. “This is not urban violence. The streets are deserted. They didn’t even ask him for his release form. He didn’t resist at all.” The police in the Essone department  where the incident took place  did not respond to a specific inquiry about Mr. El Allaki’s claims. Mr. El Allaki’s case is one of several involving police violence being investigated by prosecutors. Mr. Esmili  the sociologist  warned that the way the authorities were enforcing the lockdown was only reinforcing the worst expectations of many in France’s poorest areas. “Look  the state is completely ignoring how people live in these neighborhoods ” he said. “Its only response to them is an excess of authoritarianism. And the people are beginning to understand  the only response is police force.” Constant Meheut contributed reporting.

A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces.

Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/europe/northern-ireland-abortion-uk.html, world europe, Legal Abortion Begins in Northern Ireland, Under a threat from women’s groups to take the matter to court  the health authorities confirmed that the procedure could now be carried out by medical professionals in the region., Supported by Under a threat from women’s groups to take the matter to court  the health authorities confirmed that the procedure could now be carried out by medical professionals in the region. By Ceylan Yeginsu LONDON — After a week of mounting legal pressure  Northern Ireland’s Department of Health authorized abortion services in the region late on Thursday  putting into force legislation that overturns one of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws. Last month  abortion rights were extended to Northern Ireland for pregnancies up to 12 weeks  but the introduction of services was delayed by the health minister  Robin Swann  who has been accused of using the coronavirus outbreak to stall the process because of his ideological objections. Abortion is one of the most contentious issues in Northern Irish politics. The legislation legalizing abortion was passed by the British Parliament after the collapse of the region’s power-sharing government. The regional government was restored in January  and has been torn by the abortion issue ever since. Before the laws went into effect on Thursday  women seeking free abortions in Northern Ireland had to travel to England. (Abortion services are available in the Republic of Ireland  but the cost of $500 is prohibitive for many women.) Currently  because of the coronavirus lockdown  the only way to get to England is to take an eight-hour ferry ride from Belfast to Liverpool. Once there  the women meet with a doctor and are required to take an abortion pill in the doctor’s presence. Many of them  unable to afford overnight accommodation  immediately return to the ferry  where they risk miscarrying during the trip home. Outraged by the situation  women’s rights groups threatened the region’s health authorities with action in the courts. After receiving legal advice  the Department of Health said on Thursday that it would authorize medical professionals in hospitals and clinics to provide services. “The confirmation we have received today means that Northern Ireland Health Trusts will now provide early medical abortion in Northern Ireland ” Emma Campbell  co-chairwoman of the Northern Irish reproductive rights group Alliance for Choice  said in a statement on Friday. “This will prevent hundreds of women and pregnant people from having to travel needlessly to clinics in England placing themselves at risk ” she added. “We want to give thanks to dedicated people on the ground and honor those who never got the support of our health system.” Abortion rights groups are now calling on health officials to authorize the provision of telemedicine abortions  recently introduced in the rest of the United Kingdom. That would allow Northern Irish women in the early stages of pregnancy to self-administer abortion medication at home after a remote consultation with a doctor. The issue of telemedicine has been locked up in a debate between the two main parties of the power-sharing government: Sinn Fein  which supports telemedicine abortions  at least during the coronavirus outbreak; and the right-wing Democratic Unionist Party  which supports the old law  which barred abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. Hazal Atay  a sexual and reproductive rights activist  defended the practice. “Telemedicine abortion has been proven to be safe and effective  legal restrictions in Northern Ireland prevent its application and deprive women and pregnant people of safe abortion access ” she said.

11/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-governors-north-carolina-new-hampshire.html, us politics, How the Virus Crisis Could Help a Red-State Democrat Stay in Office, In North Carolina  where the governor’s race is tight  and New Hampshire  where a Republican seeks re-election in a blue-trending state  incumbents could benefit from newfound star power., Supported by In North Carolina  where the governor’s race is tight  and New Hampshire  where a Republican seeks re-election in a blue-trending state  incumbents could benefit from newfound star power. By Trip Gabriel Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire is ideologically limber  a Republican who favors abortion rights but vetoed a bill banning firearms on school property. At 45  he is one of America’s youngest governors  and a member of a well-known political family. He is also seeking re-election in a state increasingly inhospitable to his party. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina is a mild-mannered Southerner who slipped into office in 2016 after a backlash over an anti-transgender rights law. He is a Democrat who has largely been thwarted by the Republican-led legislature  and is in search of a second term in a state with an energized Trump base. Mr. Sununu and Mr. Cooper face two of the most competitive governor’s races in the country this year out of 11 on the ballot. But even as they paddle against the political currents  their handling of the coronavirus outbreak has won bipartisan support. As governors nationwide see their favorability rise for taking charge in a time of crisis  those facing voters in November may benefit beyond the usual blessings of incumbency. In contrast to President Trump  whose approval bump during the health emergency has been modest by historic standards and is rapidly fading  governors are experiencing strong support for providing sober updates of new cases and hands-on guidance like how to apply for unemployment checks. Once dull gray figures to most voters  governors have emerged as political stars thanks to daily news conferences and the gravity of the health emergency. A Monmouth University Poll published Wednesday found that 72 percent of adults nationally thought their governors were doing a good job handling the virus. “I think the governors are closer to the sun  closer to the voters; when you’re leading in a time of crisis it’s very relevant to them ” said Morgan Jackson  Mr. Cooper’s political strategist. The approval may diminish as the election heats up in October and voters retreat to their partisan corners  he said. “But governors are in a better position even than a United States senator and the president to take advantage of this time.” In North Carolina  voters shared in interviews this week the anxieties of Americans everywhere  concerned about dwindling savings  long waits for small-business relief and unemployment benefits  and a lack of testing for the virus. But even people who want to re-elect Mr. Trump praised Mr. Cooper’s stay-at-home order of March 27  which at the time was only the second by a Southern governor. On Thursday  he extended the social distancing mandate  limiting the number of people who can be in stores and placing restrictions on nursing homes. “He’s doing everything in his power to keep everyone as safe as possible ” Matthew Greene  a political independent  said of Mr. Cooper. A small-business owner in Winston-Salem  who voted for Mr. Trump and is likely to again  Mr. Greene  34  added: “I don’t think anybody’s thinking about who to vote for right now. They’re looking for answers and safety and whoever’s going to make them feel safe is who they’ll vote for.” Polls show Mr. Cooper’s job approval has climbed to the mid-50s  up 10 points from the first three years of his administration  which counts as a healthy advantage in a state split down the middle politically. Melissa Spurling  a behavioral therapist in rural Belwood  N.C.  is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump’s but said that Mr. Cooper was doing a good job — because “he’s taking his lead from the president ” in her view. Mr. Trump first advised Americans to keep children home from school and avoid restaurants  unessential travel and gatherings of more than 10 people on March 16. That was 11 days before Mr. Cooper issued his more sweeping stay-at-home mandate backed by the power of law enforcement. Ms. Spurling  49  is open to voting for Mr. Cooper over his Republican challenger  Dan Forest  who has been largely eclipsed by the governor during the crisis. “I haven’t heard anything positive about him ” she said of Mr. Forest  who is the lieutenant governor. “At times like this you don’t really hear about other politicians except for the ones in office.” In New Hampshire  a poll by the University of New Hampshire in mid-March showed only 41 percent of state residents approved of how Mr. Trump was handling the pandemic  but three out of four approved of Mr. Sununu’s handling of the crisis. The governor’s supporters crossed political lines  including 70 percent of independents and 61 percent of Democrats. This week the governor reversed his objections to widespread use of mail-in ballots and said the state would offer them to all voters requesting one in November. “Sununu’s been ubiquitous in terms of giving good information and keeping calm and encouraging people to do takeout and stay home ” said Dave Carney  a Republican strategist in New Hampshire. Partisan views of Mr. Trump  Mr. Carney added  are so hardened that even events as dramatic as the coronavirus outbreak and bitter arguments over whether the president adequately met the threat barely shift public opinion. By contrast  there is less partisanship around governors  who are seen as local problem-solvers. Mr. Carney predicted 2020 would be a good year for incumbents up and down the ballot nationally because challengers will have a tough time breaking through to voters who are deeply concerned about their health and jobs  especially if there is a second wave of infections in the fall. “It’s going to be hard to defeat an incumbent based on normal red and blue teams ” he said. That may be good news for vulnerable Republican senators and Democrats in the House  who have shifted from traditional campaigning to Zooming town halls with health experts and intense constituent service around small-business loans and unemployment benefits. All told  as many as nine incumbent governors will be on the ballot in November. The Cook Political Report  a nonpartisan handicapper  rates three of the Republicans and two Democrats as “solid” for re-election. Three Republicans  including Mr. Sununu  are “likely” to retain seats. There is one open governorship  in Montana  which Cook rates a tossup (while Utah’s open seat is a virtual lock to stay in Republican hands). Mr. Cooper’s race in North Carolina is rated “lean Democrat ” the most competitive of all the incumbents’ contests. His Republican opponent  Mr. Forest  is a social conservative who strongly backed a 2016 law that required people to use public bathrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. After it became a target of national ridicule and boycotts  Mr. Cooper made its repeal a top campaign issue. He narrowly defeated Gov. Pat McCrory  the only Republican governor to lose in 2016. The bathroom law  known as H.B. 2  was tossed out. Many North Carolina voters split their tickets in 2016  voting for both Mr. Trump and Mr. Cooper because of opposition to the bathroom law or a desire to put a check on the Republican legislature. It is unknown how many of those Trump voters will stick with Mr. Cooper this year. One of them  David Lindsay  a mortgage loan officer for a bank in Cabarrus County outside Charlotte  said he would “reluctantly  most likely” vote for Mr. Trump again. “I’m aware he’s an idiot and sticks his foot in his mouth  that’s no shock ” he said. “But I think a lot of the time he does have the United States’ best interest in mind.” He said Joseph R. Biden Jr.  the presumed Democratic nominee  “seems to be stumbling and not knowing what he’s talking about a lot of the time.” Mr. Lindsay  37  was undecided about the governor’s race. “I do think Governor Cooper has done a pretty good job since he’s been in office ” he said  including his handling of the coronavirus. “I almost wish it would have been a little stricter. If this thing is as bad as everybody reporting it thinks  we have to nip it in the bud.” In mid-March  Mr. Forest opposed an order by Mr. Cooper to close bars and restaurants to combat the virus  citing economic fallout. A spokesman for Mr. Forest declined an interview request  saying the candidate has paused campaign activities since the outbreak. “We will continue to monitor the situation and at some point will get back to basics ” the spokesman said. North Carolina is unique among states this year because it is holding highly competitive races for governor  the Senate and the presidency. Although the state has been losing terrain for Democrats in federal elections for a decade  demographic changes are nudging it toward tossup status. Sabato’s Crystal Ball  a nonpartisan political handicapper at the University of Virginia  moved North Carolina this month from leaning Republican in the presidential contest to a tossup. It noted that Mr. Biden has consistently lead Mr. Trump in state polling. In the Senate race  Thom Tillis  a first-term Republican  is regarded as vulnerable. The Senate campaign finance arms of both parties plan to shovel more money into the race than any other in the country: $21.6 million on the Republican side and $25.6 million by Democrats. The Tillis campaign hopes enthusiasm for Mr. Trump  whose approval rating of 50 percent in North Carolina is higher than the national average  sweeps along the senator. It is tying his opponent  Cal Cunningham  a former state lawmaker  to what it calls “radical  liberal” polices embraced by Democrats. In a sign that nasty campaign ads are unlikely to disappear despite a health emergency  the state Democratic Party unearthed old footage of Mr. Tillis saying he had no problem with restaurants not requiring employees to wash their hands  for a suddenly relevant digital attack ad. Since 2016  when Mr. Trump carried North Carolina by 173 000 votes  or 3.6 percentage points  demographic trends have been reshaping the state. Charlotte and the Raleigh-Durham region continue to draw college-educated job seekers from out of state  many of whom import blue-state values. Mr. Jackson  the Democratic strategist  who is advising Mr. Cooper and Mr. Cunningham  said a threshold has been crossed since 2016  with a majority of North Carolina voters in his internal surveys saying for the first time they did not live in the state 20 years ago — either because they have been born since then or moved in from elsewhere. In the March 3 primary  Democratic voters under 40 outnumbered younger Republicans by four to one  according to statistics compiled by J. Michael Bitzer of Catawba College. The imbalance needs to be taken with a grain of salt since there was no competitive Republican presidential primary.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/trump-food-stamps-delay.html, us politics, Trump Backs Off Tougher Food Stamp Work Rules for Now, Under heavy criticism for pressing for food stamp cuts during an economic meltdown  the Trump administration now says it will hold off during the national emergency., Supported by Under heavy criticism for pressing for food stamp cuts during an economic meltdown  the Trump administration now says it will hold off during the national emergency. By Lola Fadulu WASHINGTON — The Trump administration  under fire for pushing food stamp cuts in the middle of a pandemic  has decided to hold off on stricter work requirements for adults without children during the national emergency. “People need food and that’s what U.S.D.A. does ” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said this week in a statement to The New York Times. Initially  the Trump administration planned to appeal a court decision from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  which issued a temporary court injunction on its work requirements rule  which were to go into effect on April 1. But it has since changed its tone. By the Agriculture Department’s own estimates  the change would have led to nearly 700 000 people losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits  formerly known as food stamps. “Especially now  as a global pandemic poses widespread health risks  guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP is essential ” Chief Judge Beryl Howell wrote in the decision that came the same day President Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency. Congress then stepped in  and in one of its economic stabilization packages  waived the work requirement for the duration of the national emergency  in addition to another month. Now the administration has reached agreement with the states that had sued it on a schedule for the remaining events in the case. The agreement is contingent on the department not appealing the temporary injunction  and a final ruling is likely to be issued in the fall. Asked about the department’s plan to appeal the court ruling  Mr. Perdue said the department would “comply with the legislation which really pauses that during this public health emergency.” “While we  in a normal situation  were moving in a way to enforce what the common thinking was regarding food supply  we are going to be as flexible as we can ” he said. The food stamps program stimulates the economy when it needs it most  by expanding when people need help the most  said Lauren Bauer  a fellow at the Brookings Institution and contributor to a new report that looks at the Trump administration’s food stamp rule. The one thing many Americans are leaving their houses to do right now is buy groceries  she said. The money is put directly back into the economy. And because Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can be used for food  people can use their cash for something else such as rent or medical expenses. “In the Great Recession  SNAP was the best stimulator of the economy ” Ms. Bauer said  adding that work requirements hamper the program’s ability to do that. Ms. Bauer said that Americans were in a better place than during the recession of 2007 and 2008. At that time  only 40 percent of all American households lived in places that were eligible to have work requirements waived  Ms. Bauer said. This was because the criteria for waivers were based on economic indicators that lagged behind what was actually happening in people’s lives. For instance  even though unemployment was high across the country  the majority of nondisabled adults without children were still initially subject to a work requirement. State and local governments hoping for work-rule waivers had to secure both executive and congressional action. For the coming recession  Ms. Bauer said  Americans are better positioned because Congress and the courts have already secured those waivers. This fall  if the Agriculture Department decides to appeal and wins  states will find themselves subject to a stricter set of criteria for determining where they can waive requirements. Those requirements mandate that nondisabled adults without children can only receive food stamps for three months in a three-year period before they must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours in order to receive food assistance. That requirement might hit as the United States is trying to lift itself from a deep and sudden recession. “We don’t want to punish people  particularly low-income people  for not working when there are no jobs ” Ms. Bauer said. That sentiment may prove to be bipartisan. Robert Rector  a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a conservative welfare expert  said work requirements are needed  but they should not return for awhile. “I don’t want to have unreasonable requirements  but I do want this requirement to come back once this economy recovers because I believe it is a good thing ” he said. He said that even if the work requirements were put back as soon as the crisis was over  they “wouldn’t be binding in most areas because the unemployment rate is going to remain quite high  even if we have a robust recovery.” Liberal advocacy groups have long said that tying the waivers to unemployment rates is unfair because the rates do not account for the obstacles to employment that face women  people of color  those with minimal education or who lack transportation. Food banks  where demand has increased because of the pandemic  are worried that the final rule going into effect will mean more people coming to their doors. In April  the Greater Cleveland Food Bank had a drive-through distribution in which 2 700 cars passed through in four hours; a third of them had never been to an emergency food program before. In one week  the bank received 2 000 calls. In a typical day  it usually receives 100 calls. “We always stress that SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by food banks  and I suspect SNAP will play a critical role during the pandemic and the recovery ” said Kimberly LoVano  the director of advocacy and public education at the Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/arts/paul-kasmin-dead.html, arts, Paul Kasmin  Gallerist Who Ruled a Mini-Empire of Art  Dies at 60, With his eclectic range and loyalty to living artists  one didn’t know what to expect on walking into one of his New York galleries., Supported by With his eclectic range and loyalty to living artists  one didn’t know what to expect on walking into one of his New York galleries. By Roberta Smith Paul Kasmin  a British-born art dealer who established a small gallery empire in New York that was both loyal to an eclectic cohort of living artists and dedicated to presenting a distinctive range of historical material  died on March 23 at his home in Millbrook  N.Y. He was 60. Kasmin Gallery said the cause was cancer. Mr. Kasmin was known for his independent eye  his genial optimism and his penchant for a spare  subtly British precision of speech. In a 2018 video interview  when asked why he was participating in an Armory Show art fair in Manhattan when his own galleries in Chelsea were only about a mile away  he replied  “As long as people go to art fairs and buy things or look at things  I  too  will go to art fairs.” Over 30 years  Mr. Kasmin built his own version of a mega-gallery  comprising a cluster of exhibition spaces in Manhattan around the intersection of 10th Avenue and West 27 Street. But his was a relatively modest one that lacked the usual blue-chip artists  high-profile auction dealings  global reach  bookstores and so forth that other megas might offer. His exhibitions  having little to do with trends  nevertheless added up to a more singular vision than that of other megas. One often didn’t know what to expect on walking into one of his galleries: New abstractions by Frank Stella or the kitschy  wildly popular paintings of Mark Ryden  whose many fans would render the gallery nearly impassable because of the crowds. A scholarly show about Constantin Brancusi and Marcel Duchamp. The animal paintings of Walton Ford  rendered large in a faux-naturalist style. Mr. Kasmin showed the relatively austere photographs of Andy Warhol and Peter Hujar  but also those of Ron Galella  Jackie Kennedy’s paparazzi bête noire  as well as the showy David LaChapelle. Some of his choices were considered questionable by the selection committee of at least one prominent art fair  which rejected his gallery for years. But Mr. Kasmin’s commitment to all of his shows was never questioned. The breadth of his taste seemed very British  but he often said it reflected the influence of the New York gallerist Robert Miller  who befriended him in the 1980s  when Mr. Kasmin was based in London dealing in vintage modernist photographs. In a series of remembrances published in ARTnews on Mr. Kasmin’s death  the painter Jamie Nares  a Kasmin gallery stalwart  called him “a master at dealing with artists.” Mr. Kasmin put many of his artists on stipends and stubbornly showed their work  regardless of sales. Mr. Ford recounted in ARTnews that once Mr. Kasmin got behind an artist’s career  his advice would be to keep working and he would take care of the rest. “We’ll sort it out ” he often said. Describing Mr. Kasmin on his first visit to Mr. Ford’s studio in upstate New York  the artist wrote that the dealer “wore a snug  wool bespoke suit and was ruddy  plump and sleek at the same time.” He added  “I thought he looked just like a bemused little animal from a Beatrix Potter book.” Paul Foubert Kasmin was born in London on Feb. 19  1960  the older of two sons of John and Jane (Nicholson) Kasmin. Art was an inescapable aspect of the familial terrain. Mr. Kasmin’s father  who was universally known as Kas  was for decades the dean of the London contemporary art dealers; he gave David Hockney his first solo show in 1963. He also showed British artists like Richard Smith and Anthony Caro  and introduced the work of postwar Americans like Helen Frankenthaler  Kenneth Noland  Morris Louis and Frank Stella. Mr. Kasmin’s mother  an expert and dealer in patchwork quilts  comes from a line of distinguished creators  including her father  the architect Christopher Nicholson; her mother  the painter and textile designer EQ Nicholson  to whom Paul was close; her uncle  the modernist Ben Nicholson; and her paternal grandparents  the painters William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde. His parents survive him  as do his brother  Aaron Kasmin  who is also an artist; his wife  Melanie Courbet-Kasmin; and two daughters  Olivia Kasmin and Charlotte Kasmin  from his first marriage  to Alexandra Sutherland  which ended in divorce. Mr. Kasmin enjoyed a privileged  high bohemian childhood in his parents’ homes in London and the Dordogne region of southwestern France. Guests at either residence included various artists represented by his father  especially Mr. Hockney and Mr. Stella  and friends like the painter Howard Hodgkin  the designer and entrepreneur Terence Conran and the writer Bruce Chatwin. Mr. Kasmin spent time in his father’s gallery and traveled with him to New York for the first time at age 10  as well as to New Zealand  India and Morocco. His parents separated when he was 12 and eventually divorced. Mr. Kasmin became a knowledgeable naturalist  gourmand and cook; an impassioned museum visitor and hiker; and a voracious reader and bibliophile who often advertised his gallery in The New York Review of Books. While at boarding school at Bryanston  England  he took up photography and never put it down  capturing striking portraits of family  friends and artists and recording landscapes  meals and interiors. He referred to his camera as “my diary.” His work sometimes appeared in newspapers and magazines with the credit Percy Washington  a name he borrowed from the hero of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novella “The Diamond as Big as the Ritz.” (At his death  a selection of his photographs was posted at kasmingallery.com.) Mr. Kasmin studied art history at University College London and earned his bachelor’s degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art. He also dealt privately in photography  taking  and sometimes selling  his own photographs. In 1981  with two close friends — the future designer Jasper Morrison  Mr. Conran’s nephew; and the future writer-painter Danny Moynihan — Mr. Kasmin established The Space  a gallery of primarily contemporary figurative art in the Kensington Market area of London. He peeled off after a season  returning to private dealing and traveling. In 1985  Mr. Kasmin and Mr. Moynihan opened Credo  an office in Mr. Moynihan’s parents’ house in London  from which they dealt privately in photography. They moved the business to New York in 1988  renting a small gallery-office designed by Mr. Morrison on Broadway and Prince Street  a SoHo address teeming with galleries at the time. Their first show was of Constantin Brancusi photographs  followed by the postcards of the British Conceptualists Gilbert & George  followed by Mr. Hockney’s early drawings. The space then became the first iteration of the Paul Kasmin Gallery  which Mr. Kasmin relocated to 74 Grand Street  also in SoHo  in 1989. He opened with an exhibition of abstract paintings by Peter Schuyff. Within a few years he was staging regular shows of Mr. Nares and Mr. Ford as well as Elliott Puckette  with appearances by the sculptor Nancy Rubins  the painter Santi Moix and the photographer Aaron Rose. In 1999  Mr. Kasmin joined a wave of SoHo galleries in moving to Chelsea  where he eventually opened three spaces. He exhibited historical material  starting on a personal note with shows devoted to his father’s gallery in 2001  and the paintings of William Nicholson  his great-grandfather  in 2004. Other exhibitions focused on Brancusi; the gallerist Alexander Iolas; Henry Geldzahler  the influential curator of 20th-century art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 1960s; and the art of ’80s New York. In 2007  Mr. Kasmin gave the first New York exhibition in nearly 30 years to the furniture-sculpture of the French artists Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne; he went on to show designers like Ron Arad  Mattia Bonetti  David Wiseman and  in 2019  Mr. Morrison. After 2010  he began to represent the estates of neglected artists  most notably William N. Copley  a maker of patterned  cartoonish and sometimes erotic paintings. He would eventually represent the estates of distinguished artists like Stuart Davis  Robert Motherwell  Lee Krasner  Jane Freilicher and Max Ernst. In 2017  he commissioned the architect Markus Dochantschi to design a building at a lot previously occupied by a scrap metal yard on West 27th Street near the High Line. He continued with the project even after he learned he had cancer. It opened in the fall of 2018  and he prepared his staff to carry on without him.

30/03/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/arts/music/edward-tarr-dead.html, arts music, Edward Tarr  Renowned Trumpeter Who Delved Into Past  Dies at 83, Mr. Tarr was a scholar  teacher and performer who helped revive the natural trumpet  a sweet-sounding  valveless version of the modern instrument., Supported by Mr. Tarr was a scholar  teacher and performer who helped revive the natural trumpet  a sweet-sounding  valveless version of the modern instrument. By Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim Edward H. Tarr  a trumpeter and musicologist who became one of the world’s eminent authorities on the instrument  resuscitating long-forgotten repertory and leading the way in historically informed performances of baroque and romantic brass music  died on March 24 in Germany. He was 83. The cause was complications of heart surgery  his wife  Irmtraud Tarr  said. He died in a hospital near Rheinfelden  the town in southwestern Germany where he lived. Mr. Tarr left his mark on every aspect of the trumpet world. As a player he set new standards of lyricism on an instrument long associated with military bravado. As a scholar he hunted for rarities in European archives and created performance editions of hundreds of newly discovered works. He advised instrument makers  curated a trumpet museum  wrote seminal books  edited historical treatises and taught players who went on to become leading concert artists. For a brief period Mr. Tarr dipped into the European avant-garde. He commissioned a work for trumpet and tape  “Morceau de Concert ” from the Argentine-born German composer Mauricio Kagel  and he is among the dedicatees of “Spiral ” by the modernist Karlheinz Stockhausen. Mr. Tarr in 1970 was one of 20 musicians who took turns performing that piece a total of 1 300 times inside the German pavilion at the World Expo in Osaka  Japan. Mr. Tarr’s lasting passion was the recognition of the natural trumpet as a key to unlocking lost sound worlds. That early version of the trumpet — the kind that Bach and other Baroque composers wrote for — lacked the valves that the modern counterpart has. Those valves lend playability  power and range. Mr. Tarr willfully embraced the difficulty of playing without the improvements. “Before Ed we tended to think that they must have been vile-sounding things ” the British trumpeter John Wallace  in a phone interview  said of period brass instruments. “Because of him we came to understand that playing on the real  the natural  instruments was actually essential to understanding baroque and classical music to the full.” Mr. Tarr embraced the dual role of the scholar-performer  immersing himself in theoretical texts from the 17th and 18th centuries in order to shape his playing. The musicologist Steven Plank said that Mr. Tarr’s trademark expressivity and elegant phrasing were rooted in historical ideals. “There’s a kind of vocality that comes along with period tonguings  which he was very adept with ” Professor Plank said. “He was strong in articulating the idea — and this is something period sources make clear — that the trumpet is of two natures  one being the martial instrument of war and the other actually a very sweet and lyrical instrument.” A video from the 1980s shows Mr. Tarr playing Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 on a modern instrument. His tone is radiant yet sufficiently slender to mesh equitably with the solo oboe and violin. Edward Hankins Tarr was born on June 15  1936  in Norwich  Conn. His father  Donald Tarr  was a Methodist minister; his mother Ruth (Wilkinson) Tarr was a teacher who led and sang in a choir. He was 6 when his class was introduced to various musical instruments. He later told his wife that when the teacher held up a trumpet  his own hand rose up as if by reflex  and he blurted out  “That’s mine!” Mr. Tarr received a bachelor of arts degree from Oberlin College in 1957 and a master’s in trumpet performance from Northwestern University in 1959. His main teachers  Roger Voisin of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Adolph Herseth of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra  represented the brilliant and muscular American brass sound that was the envy of orchestras around the world. Mr. Tarr in 1959 obtained a scholarship to travel to Basel  to study with the musicologist and early music specialist Leo Schrade. The move marked a pivot toward the past  and Europe  that would shape the rest of his life. He earned a Ph.D in musicology from the University of Hamburg in 1987. By then he had already established himself as an authority on historical trumpet playing; he would go on to publish more than 70 articles in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. His book “The Trumpet ” published in German in 1977 and in English in 1988  became the definitive guide to the instrument’s history. Landmarks in Mr. Tarr’s reconstruction of that history included his editing of the first critical edition of a youthful work for trumpet and orchestra by Verdi. The score  which assigns to the instrument all the melodic panache of an opera singer  was discovered in 1996 inside the upholstery of a chair in the composer’s hometown  Busseto  Italy. Research in Portugal in the 1970s yielded the glittering music for trumpet ensembles of the Charamela Real  or royal stables. Mr. Tarr edited and published those discoveries and assembled period brass players from across Europe to play them. Mr. Tarr taught trumpet at the Basel Music Academy from 1972 to 2001. He also served on the faculties of the conservatories of Cologne  Karlsruhe and Frankfurt in Germany and Lucerne  Switzerland  and acted as visiting faculty member at universities in Europe and America. From 1985 to 2004 he was the director of the Trumpet Museum in Bad Säckingen  Germany  near the Swiss border. He settled in Rheinfelden  a nearby village  with his second wife  the concert organist and psychologist Irmtraud Tarr  who became his duo partner beginning in 1980. His first marriage  to Madeleine Fiorese  ended in divorce. He is survived by two children from that marriage  Natalie  and Philip  a virologist and baroque timpanist  as well as four grandchildren. The Tarrs had also taken in a young man  Jörg Richter  who was mute and autistic. Ms. Tarr coaxed him back to speech  and Mr. Tarr taught him to carve trumpet mouthpieces out of wood  which are now much sought after by players.

He later collected his advice in a best-selling book. By Daniel E. Slotnik Earl G. Graves Sr.  an entrepreneur who fostered success in the African-American business community by founding the magazine Black Enterprise and writing the book “How to Succeed in Business Without Being White ” died on Monday at a care facility in White Plains  N.Y. He was 85. His son  Earl G. Graves Jr.  Black Enterprise’s current chief executive  said the cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Mr. Graves created Black Enterprise in 1970 with a $175 000 loan and the backing of advertisers he courted himself. The magazine was designed to appeal to newly ascendant African-American professionals  to encourage young people to become entrepreneurs in their own right  and to make black executives a more recognizable part of American corporate culture. The idea of targeting the black business community was novel  but Mr. Graves pitched it with confidence befitting the multimillionaire publisher and businessman he would become. “I was just another entrepreneur who believed in himself ” Mr. Graves told The Post-Standard of Syracuse  N.Y.  in 2005. “The only difference was that I was black.” Mr. Graves set up a board of powerful African-American advisers  including Senator Edward W. Brooke III of Massachusetts  Representative Shirley Chisholm of New York and Julian Bond  the civil rights activist and a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. To build an audience  he sent free copies of Black Enterprise to black professionals  ministers and politicians and many corporations. Black Enterprise  which featured profiles of African-American businessmen and women  advice on navigating the corporate world for young professionals and an annual list of the most successful black-owned companies  proved popular. In time it became a combination of publications like Forbes  Money and Fortune aimed at African-American readers. Earl Graves Jr. said that the magazine’s print circulation peaked at around half a million in the early 2000s. Mr. Graves  instantly recognizable in a power suit with suspenders and thick but meticulous sideburns  also ran a successful soft drink franchise with investors including Magic Johnson and served on several corporate boards  including those of Aetna  American Airlines and what was then DaimlerChrysler. In 1997 Mr. Graves published “How to Succeed in Business Without Being White: Straight Talk on Making it in America ” which he wrote with Wes Smith. The book  a New York Times best seller  included concrete lessons on networking  maximizing career opportunities and building wealth gleaned from Mr. Graves’s lifetime of entrepreneurship. It also emphasized that Mr. Graves saw the goal as an equal chance at success rather than special treatment. “The white-dominated business world needs to understand that we don’t want charity ” he wrote. “We want to do business. We don’t want guaranteed success. We want the opportunity to earn it.” Earl Gilbert Graves was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 9  1935  to Earl Graves  an immigrant from Barbados  and Winifred (Sealy) Graves  who was from Trinidad. He grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father worked in the garment industry and his mother was a homemaker. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn  then studied business at what is now Morgan State University  a historically black institution in Baltimore  where he sold flowers  mowed lawns  worked as a security guard and was on the track team. After graduating  he spent some years in the Army  then returned to Brooklyn  where he worked in law enforcement and real estate. He also volunteered with local government and civic groups  including one dedicated to improving Bedford-Stuyvesant that was founded by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Mr. Graves met Kennedy after organizing a rally for him in Brooklyn in the mid-1960s. Earl Graves Jr. said that Kennedy was so impressed with Mr. Graves’s organizational acumen that he offered him a job on his staff  which he accepted. Mr. Graves worked for Kennedy until he was assassinated in 1968  after which he returned to Brooklyn. Someone in the Bedford-Stuyvesant group suggested that he start a newsletter to publicize advances in the black business community. The newsletter grew into Black Enterprise. In 1960 Mr. Graves married Barbara Kydd. She died in 2012. In addition to his son Earl Jr.  he is survived by two other sons  John and Michael; two sisters  Joan Jones and Sandra Graves; a brother  Robert; and eight grandchildren. In 2006 Mr. Graves retired as Black Enterprise’s chief executive  though he remained chairman until his death. Black Enterprise is still printed periodically  but Earl Graves Jr. said that the company now focuses more on events  social media and its website  which attracts about two million unique visitors a month. In “How to Succeed in Business " Mr. Graves wrote that when he was a student at Morgan State and told acquaintances that he hoped to be a successful businessman  they often reacted with incredulity because “the concept of a black businessman with his own corporation” was “largely a foreign  even a laughable  one to blacks as well as whites.” Times have changed  in part helped by Mr. Graves’s efforts  and his alma mater now trains new generations of African-American entrepreneurs at the Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management. Kitty Bennett contributed research.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-unemployment-small-business.html, opinion, ‘We’re Going Down  Down  Down  Down  Down’, Staggering job losses are not a foregone conclusion. There is still time to fix the federal government’s aid program., Supported by Staggering job losses are not a foregone conclusion. There is still time to fix the federal government’s aid program. By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. The federal government is struggling to deliver financial aid to faltering employers — and workers are suffering the consequences. Roughly 10 percent of American workers filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks  a wave of job losses that has no precedent in modern American history. Millions more are struggling to submit unemployment claims to overwhelmed state agencies. And still more face the loss of their jobs in the coming weeks. The scale of the economic damage is breathtaking. In one recent poll  more than half of all Americans under the age of 45 said that they had lost their jobs or suffered a loss of hours. Some businesses may survive the crisis by shedding workers now  but they face long-term costs  too: the loss of trained and experienced workers  the uncertainties of hiring new ones. The federal government was slow to react to the pandemic. Local officials began ordering businesses to shut down weeks before Congress moved to provide those businesses with the lifeline they so obviously needed. Timely action by itself could have saved millions of jobs. When Congress did act  it failed to grasp the magnitude of the crisis. The aid bill passed at the end of March allocated $349 billion to support small businesses despite warnings from experts that the government needed to provide two or three times as much money to limit job losses. Already Congress is considering $250 billion more in spending  which still is insufficient. And on top of all that  the aid program is poorly designed. The Small Business Administration  tapped to oversee the program  manages a loan portfolio of about $120 billion in normal times. Unsurprisingly  the agency has been overwhelmed by the expansion of its responsibilities. Congress also erred in relying on banks to make the loans. Crisis lending requires a degree of imprudence — the goal is to get money out the door. Banks  on the other hand  are legally required to exercise caution. The result: Banks quickly started imposing new conditions  such as refusing to deal with new customers  leaving many businesses bewildered  frustrated — and unable to get the money they desperately need. It’s not too late for Congress to take a different approach to limit the damage. What’s needed is a blank-check promise to provide the money necessary for employers to pay workers. European nations  including France  Germany and Britain  are fighting mass unemployment by paying companies to hold on to their employees. The government gives money to the companies  which give it to the workers; the workers stay home and get paid. Senator Josh Hawley  Republican of Missouri  has proposed an American version. Under his plan  the government would pay up to 80 percent of payroll costs for each employee up to the median wage — which the Social Security Administration pegged at $32 828 in 2018. Mr. Hawley’s whatever-it-takes plan recognizes the immensity of this crisis. “It’s like  ‘Wow  we’re going down  down  down  down  down.’ Nobody can see the bottom ” he told The Washington Post. “I personally don’t care to find out where the bottom might be!” Crucially  the money would be distributed by a much larger arm of the government  the Internal Revenue Service. (The program is technically designed as a payroll tax rebate.) The plan also would provide a bonus for rehiring workers laid off since the crisis began. And the same aid would be available to larger employers affected by the crisis  too. The most important shortcoming with Mr. Hawley’s program is that it’s still not big enough. It would provide a maximum of about $500 per week per employee  which is less than the $600 per week in extra unemployment benefits that Congress authorized in March. Representative Pramila Jayapal  Democrat of Washington  proposed on Friday that the government pay 100 percent of weekly wages for workers making up to $100 000. That’s overly generous. The payment is basically an unemployment check with the added bonus that people will eventually return to the same jobs. The government doesn’t need to carry workers making $100 000 at their full salaries to get them through the crisis. But it shouldn’t be hard to find a sensible middle ground between the two schemes. There is clear value in preventing unemployment. The loss of a job is traumatic and  in the United States  it often includes the loss of health insurance  too. When the economy revives  both workers and employers will benefit from resuming their former relationships. American businesses and workers urgently need federal help: More  better help.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-political-reform.html, opinion, After the Pandemic  the Big Reset, Some of the greatest advances in American history were birthed by disaster., Supported by Some of the greatest advances in American history were birthed by disaster. By Timothy Egan Contributing Opinion Writer Every crisis opens a course to the unknown. In an eye-blink  the impossible becomes possible. History in a sprint can mean a dark  lasting turn for the worse  or a new day of enlightened public policy. Be still  my heart  but I see the latter. Some of the greatest advances in American history — liberation of slaves  Social Security  robust clean air and water mandates — were birthed by disaster. For now  the coronavirus pandemic is an epic of sorrow  and has many mortal months still to run. But in the midst of our suffering  our grief for loved ones lost  our loneliness in social isolation  we have a chance to re-engineer our world. Here’s a look at what may follow as the pandemic starts to settle: Health Care. Universal medical coverage  whether expanding Obamacare with a public option or some form of Medicare for all  is going to happen. It’s had majority support for some time. The pandemic has just sped up the timetable. One poll found that 41 percent of adults are now more likely than they were before the pandemic to support a government-run care system covering all Americans. When even the most dreadful Republicans — but I repeat myself — say that virus testing and treatment should be free  the door has opened to the obvious next step. Since the outbreak  one in four Republicans have suddenly come around to some version of what most nations already have. Now  try running for office on a platform of taking away people’s health care. Or tolerating the condition that leaves nearly 28 million Americans with no health care at all. Yep  that’s the current Republican policy  led by President Trump’s attempt to gut Obamacare through the courts. Good luck with that in November. Work. Paid family leave. Working at home. Universal sick leave. Subsidized day care. A livable minimum wage. Until about an hour ago  all of the above were considered progressive pipe dreams. But just as World War II brought millions of women into factories  millions of people may settle into another workplace following the world war on coronavirus — their homes. Up to half the jobs in the United States could be done  at least partially  from home  by one estimate. Currently  fewer than 4 percent of jobs allow this. The benefits of telecommuting — in terms of personal time  on the environment  on the psyche and on production — could be enormous. To those who can’t work at home  for one bright and shining moment we all appreciate grocery clerks  truck drivers  nurses  home health care workers and others as heroes. But we’ve never treated them that way with the range of benefits available to those who wear a different collar. Let Trump defend the broken status quo  while Joe Biden goes bold  defining what a people-centered economy would look like. Food. With seven in 10 adults overweight or obese  the poor health and nutrition of most Americans is a horrid and accepted fact. But with the disproportionate number of Covid-19 deaths attributed to diet-related conditions  we are seeing  more rapidly  just how much this societal problem can kill. This doesn’t mean we should turn to fat shaming. But it does mean that  while looking at obesity as a public health problem as deadly as smoking  we can make some big structural changes in the food system. For starters  there should be universal free school meals. Kids who take advantage of this are more likely to eat fruits and vegetables. But under the present system  many poor students feel so stigmatized that they go hungry instead. For adults  the paradox of living in a nation where 40 million people face food insecurity while 40 percent of our food is wasted  makes no sense. One quick solution is to allow all 42 million Americans who receive food stamps to shop online and get their groceries delivered like everyone else. One lasting solution is to standardize date labeling  so that food that may not be perfect quality is still safe to eat and can be used by food banks. And it’s time to recognize the vital value of people who harvest our fruits and vegetables. Up to half of farmworkers are undocumented  and the Trump administration has been harassing and demeaning them. But lo: The Department of Homeland Security has just classified farmworkers as “essential critical infrastructure workers.” Let’s make that permanent through the big immigration fix that awaits a new president. Climate. One byproduct of so many people working at home is clean air. With the global economy in a coma  emissions could fall by the largest amount since World War II. But this could have little impact on the trajectory of climate change if we don’t make larger structural changes. China is already firing up its coal-powered factories. We have only a few years to save ourselves from ourselves. Our trashed and overheated world is a slower pandemic. The good news is that  even with the crash in oil prices  renewable energy use is on an upward course. Coal is yesterday  no matter how much Trump tries to promote it and China drags its heels. More than anything  the pandemic has shown how quickly things can change if they must. Carpe diem. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-FDA.html, opinion, Covid-19 and the Big Government Problem, What happens when bureaucratic dead weight meets a horseman of the apocalypse?, Supported by What happens when bureaucratic dead weight meets a horseman of the apocalypse? By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Katie Wilson  a deputy under secretary at the Department of Agriculture in the Obama administration  is the executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance  a nonprofit that works with the country’s largest school districts to improve the quality of student nutrition. Her topmost concern is with the millions of poorer children and their families for whom school meals are essential to diets and budgets alike. In this pandemic  she has a message for government bureaucrats in Washington and every state capital: Stop getting in the way. I spoke with Wilson on Thursday as the districts she works with were dealing with a crisis that in weeks has cascaded from lockdowns and school closures to mass unemployment and massive food insecurity. Adaptability  responsiveness  improvisation and foresight are of the essence. It’s a big ask of big government. The U.S.D.A. didn’t have any trouble responding to school closures by switching to summer feeding programs. And Congress knew enough to give the department authority to waive some of the regulatory requirements. But  says Wilson  “Every waiver has layers and layers and layers on it.” “To get a waiver each district has to apply to the state ” she notes. “The state has to decide whether to accept it. If they agree  then they have to apply to the U.S.D.A. If the U.S.D.A. says yes  the state can get the waiver  the district can get the waiver  but then the state has to interpret how you do it.” Example: Oregon applied to the U.S.D.A. for an area-eligibility waiver so it could provide food for needy families living in non-poor areas. The department allowed the waiver  with the requirement  Wilson says  that each school district would have to work with a state agency “to develop a plan as to how they are going to target the most-needy students.” But as the economy collapses  the need keeps growing  and nobody can be sure who the “most-needy” students will be. Desperate school districts have their right arm chained to bureaucratic dead weight — and their left to a horseman of the apocalypse. It’s not just U.S.D.A. From 2007 to 2019  the total number of employees in the Food and Drug Administration increased by nearly 80 percent to more than 17 000 employees  according to a Cato Institute report. That includes nearly 500 additional workers to review the safety of medical devices. Has it helped? In March  Julia Ioffe wrote a must-read account in GQ of the F.D.A.’s almost-comical mishandling of an effort to roll out coronavirus test kits. First the F.D.A. approved a flawed test. Then they stymied an effective test by requiring its developer to submit his request not only electronically but also mailed in paper and via thumb drive. Then the F.D.A. demanded that the developer see if his test worked against other coronaviruses. Then the F.D.A. shut down a testing regime developed by the Seattle Flu Study because it lacked the correct licensing requirements. Congress also had to overturn F.D.A. regulations in order to permit hospitals to purchase N95 masks previously approved only for industrial use. The country may need billions of such masks now. But as Reason magazine reported last month  federal regulators have told one would-be manufacturer that certification and approval might take between 45 and 90 days. And this is government operating in an emergency. On Tuesday  New York City’s Health Department sent a stern letter to health providers  warning that there are no approved blood tests for use at point-of-care facilities to check for coronavirus antibodies  and that use of such tests “may result in regulatory action.” Everyone knows tests are far from perfect. But they are urgently needed to track the disease and could have been widely available in the U.S. weeks ago. Approval is now expected in a few days  which should at least raise a question about the point of delay. Does all of this mean that we would have been better off without any government regulation at all? Obviously not. But it says something that among the most important steps taken in recent months to advance public safety has been to waive regulations enacted in the name of public safety. The effectiveness of government is rarely correlated to its size. In this crisis  the correlation has often been inverse. Philip K. Howard  author of “Try Common Sense ” has the right idea for turning this around  both for the pandemic and the arduous economic recovery that will follow. In City Journal  he proposes a Recovery Authority at both the federal and state levels. The aim is to reduce paperwork burdens  enable one-stop permit shopping  pare uneconomical work rules  provide permanent legal approval to crisis measures that work  and otherwise lift the burdens of “thousand-page rulebooks dictating precisely how to achieve public goals.” Cutting back on big government is not an end in itself. The goals are to give individuals the chance to take responsibility  local initiatives the chance to flourish  and common sense the chance to reign. In the fight against Covid-19 and its aftermath  we also have a chance to get government to work better — starting by getting it out of the way.

By Nancy Coleman For 16 years Jennifer Pascual  the music director for St. Patrick’s Cathedral  has arrived early on Easter Sunday  often at 6:30 a.m.  just after sunrise  when she could still manage to find parking on East 51st Street. At 9 a.m.  she would try to squeeze in one more rehearsal with the choir. By 10:15  with more than 2 000 worshipers filling the church  she would lead the singers  the organist  a brass quintet  a percussionist  musicians on the harp and the flute in an exultant liturgical performance that is the musical pinnacle of the cathedral’s year. But not this year. The doors of St. Patrick’s are now locked to the public. The coronavirus pandemic means that this Easter Sunday there will be no congregants in the pews  no choristers to conduct  no sharp retorts from the brass to herald the New Testament’s recounting of the resurrection of Christ. This year  the roster of musicians is now down to two — a cantor and an organist — and there will only be two Masses on Sunday  not the usual eight or nine. But the 10 a.m. Mass  to be led by the Cardinal Timothy Dolan  will be televised and streamed live  a broadcast that is likely to draw a significant audience. Fewer than 600 people would tune in to watch the cathedral’s Sunday Mass streams before the pandemic  said Joe Zwilling  a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York — and that number was up to more than 100 000 on Palm Sunday. “We are doing it for broadcast  yes  but we do miss the people in the pews ” said Dr. Pascual  who came to St. Patrick’s in 2003 as its first female music director. “It’s kind of odd to be doing Mass and doing it to an empty cathedral. You look out there and there’s nobody there.” Even Dr. Pascual may just stay home on Sunday  as her two associate organists will be on hand to lead “Jesus Christ Is Risen Today” and other traditional hymns and ancient chants. It will be that kind of Easter for congregations and their music directors across the country. In South Carolina  a Presbyterian choir in Columbia is planning to keep only a few members on hand  all spaced apart for appropriate social distancing  The Post and Courier reported. And in Georgia  a pastor is planning to hold an in-person service — drive-in style  with churchgoers staying inside their parked cars. At St. Patrick’s  a historic landmark that attracts more than five million visitors a year  the preparations for Easter begin months ahead  and involve music for several liturgies. On Holy Thursday  the music is a bit quieter and more introspective  said Jeanne Holcomb  a member of the choir for 17 years. On Good Friday  she said  they move on to Joseph Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Christ.” By Saturday and Sunday: “Lots of hallelujahs ” she said. “It’s really  really fun to sing. You really let it all loose after those solemn services.” The highlight of her week  though  usually comes well before Masses begin  at the final rehearsal on Wednesday night. “We’d go for hours and hours  because we have to rehearse everything for Thursday  Friday  Saturday and Sunday ” Ms. Holcomb said. “And everybody’s like  ‘Oh my Lord  this is taking so long.’ But at the end of it  we just feel so accomplished.” “It’s a lot of music ” she added. “But it’s all so good.” In past years  Ms. Holcomb  who lives in Brooklyn  would usually cap off the weekend at the cathedral with a visit to her sister in New Jersey on Easter Sunday. But she will spend this year’s holiday the same way as everyone else  following Mass from afar. “I’ll watch the live stream  but otherwise  I’m singing by myself just for fun ” she said. “It’s a bummer  but then so many people have it worse. I just miss it  that’s all.” For her part  Dr. Pascual will still play the organ on Saturday night for the Easter vigil  which will also be streamed live online. Dr. Pascual has always felt a particularly strong attachment to the vigil  and to the weekend as a whole — her last name has roots in the Latin word for Easter. But this year no one will be baptized or confirmed at the cathedral during the Saturday vigil  as is usual  and the deacon who typically leads a portion of the liturgy is stuck in Portugal because of the virus. Dr. Pascual ordinarily spends most of her Easter at the church  playing the cathedral’s towering pipe organ herself for the Masses at noon and 1 p.m. “Sometimes they would throw in a 2 p.m. ” Dr. Pascual said  “if there’s really still thousands of people waiting.” Later there would be desk work to be done before finally heading home to Wood-Ridge  New Jersey. After she left  typically  there would still be two more Masses to go — one in Spanish at 4 p.m.  another in English at 5:30 — when her two associate organists would usually take the reins. “We normally have thousands and thousands of tourists coming through the door  and sometimes a line that wraps around the cathedral for people trying to get into Mass ” Dr. Pascual said. “It’s kind of sad that we don’t have that this year.” Dr. Pascual  who earned her doctorate in organ performance from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester  said she has missed the presence of the choir in services this week the most. “Not having them help provide the music is a huge loss ” she said. Still  she predicted  even reined in a bit by the necessities of public health  the music of Easter will be a great balm to many souls. “St. Augustine said  ‘He who sings prays twice ’” she said. “So hopefully what we do helps people to get through this pandemic and gives them some sense of faith and hope.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/arts/12VIRUS-ORGANIST-4/merlin_120931685_c1fec74a-e446-4021-8198-be33e5ba003d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Now  many banks want to deal only with existing customers when making loans through the government’s $349 billion aid package.

But Bank of America  one of the biggest banks participating in the program  refused to consider her application. Because Ms. Young had a credit card from Capital One  Bank of America said  Capital One was her primary bank. And Capital One was not yet accepting emergency relief loan applications. As of Friday  a week after the program was started  Capital One’s website still advised borrowers to keep checking back for updates and said its online application would be available “shortly.” Ms. Young is among the thousands of small-business owners at risk of being shut out of the government effort  known as the Paycheck Protection Program  because of limits set by lenders grappling with overwhelming demand. These loans  which do not have to be repaid if the money is used for payroll  rent or mortgage expenses  could be a lifeline for struggling businesses — if they can get them. And for small-business owners like Ms. Young  who is black  the hurdles could be much higher. That’s because minority-owned businesses often have weaker banking relationships than their white-owned counterparts — one legacy of the practice of redlining  or refusing to lend to people in communities of color. Research shows that black and Latino business owners are denied loans at higher rates. Anticipating that minority business owners could struggle to tap federal aid  some lawmakers are proposing ways to earmark additional funds specifically for minority-owned businesses. And on Wednesday  a group of prominent black investors  including John W. Rogers Jr.  the billionaire co-chief executive of Ariel Investments  a mutual fund manager  sent a letter to lawmakers expressing concern that the emergency loan program was already leaving black borrowers behind. A 2016 study by economists at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research found that only 1 percent of black business owners get a bank loan during their first year of business compared with 7 percent of white owners. Twice as many white business owners — 30 percent of the total — use business credit cards during their inaugural year  compared with black owners  among whom only 15 percent rely on a credit card. Black businesses also start out with far less capital — whether from investments or bank loans — than white businesses  the study found. “Black-owned businesses continue to rely on family loans to a greater degree than white-owned firms in the three years following the firm’s founding ” the researchers found. “This suggests that access to formal debt channels remains limited for minorities.” The institutions that frequently lend to minority-owned businesses  especially those in low-income neighborhoods  are nonprofit organizations called Community Development Financial Institutions. They rely on government funding and charitable donations to make loans  and grew out of earlier efforts to help African-Americans build wealth in the wake of slavery and segregation. However  only 78 of 950 such organizations are participating in the government program  according to a Treasury spokesman. The rest do not have authorization to participate because they have not previously been approved by the Small Business Administration to make loans backed by the agency. Their representatives say they do not yet have clarity from the government on how to get that approval quickly enough to participate in the emergency program. On Monday  the leaders of the Opportunity Finance Network  a group that represents the community development organizations  met with Treasury officials to suggest ways that the government could quickly approve the lenders for the program. But later  in a statement posted on its website  the group said that Treasury officials were “noncommittal” about what  if any  actions they would take in response to the group’s recommendations. A Treasury spokesman did not provide a timeline for when more community organizations might be approved to participate. In their letter  the group of black investors  including Ariel’s co-chief executive Mellody Hobson  who serves on the board of JPMorgan Chase  proposed that a quarter of the $250 billion in additional money for small businesses that Congress is considering adding to the program be set aside for black businesses. “This roughly $68 billion will only begin to address the disparities within capitalism brought into relief by coronavirus ” they wrote. “By prioritizing clients that already have existing lines of credit  black businesses and nonprofits find themselves yet again excluded from live-saving relief.” Some federal lawmakers have proposed that part of the second stimulus could be directed to local business development organizations that focus specifically on helping minority businesses so that they can hire lawyers and offer advice to minority-owned businesses about how to get help during the pandemic. The $2 trillion CARES Act allotted $10 million for minority chambers  but some lawmakers say that is far from enough. During a call on Wednesday with Vice President Mike Pence  members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern that funds from the program were not reaching black business owners  according to Representative Emanuel Cleaver II  Democrat of Missouri and a caucus member who was briefed on the call after it took place. Mr. Pence said that the program had gotten off to a shaky start in general  Mr. Cleaver said. “He did admit that they had had some difficulty ” Mr. Cleaver said. “The fear now is that if we don’t act quickly  by the time we get the help for minority businesses by way of having advisers through minority chambers  the fear is the money will be exhausted.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not return a call seeking comment. Racial discrimination in banking is outlawed on paper  but it continues in practice — often in subtle forms. In 2018  for instance  the National Community Reinvestment Coalition  a nonprofit organization that works with banks to increase the flow of private capital into poor and underserved communities  sent “mystery shoppers” to 32 different banks in Los Angeles. It found that potential borrowers with identical financial profiles were treated differently by bankers based on their race. Black and Latino borrowers were asked for more detailed financial documents and were given less information about many banks’ available products than white borrowers. Some minority business owners have avoided dealing with banks entirely. When Carlos Swepson  a chef in New York  wanted to start a restaurant  he borrowed $240 000 from his parents  who mortgaged their house to lend him the money. Later  when he wanted to expand  Mr. Swepson raised $400 000 from friends  one of whom also took out a mortgage. Another borrowed against a retirement account to fund him. “I never had a loan from a bank ” Mr. Swepson said  adding that he does not feel comfortable dealing with banks. “The big ones  I was getting lost with them ” Mr. Swepson said. His business checking account is at Infinity Federal Credit Union  a small credit union based in New Jersey from which he is also seeking an emergency loan under the government program. The paperwork  while routine for banking customers  is complicated and unlike anything Mr. Swepson is accustomed to filling out. He has sought help from a patron of his restaurant who happens to be a lawyer. Ms. Young  too  started Diaspora without any kind of bank loan  going so far as to learn plumbing techniques from her uncle so that she could install her own shampoo bowl. Her mother helped her paint and decorate the space. She built her own website. When she had to hire an assistant  she researched employment law. Money she earned doing customers’ hair went right back into the salon to pay for things like another styling station  a janitor and a contracted bookkeeper. “I just built myself up ” she said. “I kept building  building  building  saving  saving  saving.” Two years after she gave up trying to get a credit card through Bank of America in 2016  a friend told her about the Capital One Spark Card  explaining what terms like “cash back” and “rewards” meant  and helped her apply. (Ms. Young  now 35  had one credit card for three years during college but had canceled it when her financial situation worsened. Because she had not taken out any kind of loan since  Ms. Young said she had no recent credit history.) “We have received and are processing more than 250 000 applications from small businesses around the country ” said Bill Halldin  a Bank of America spokesman. He said the bank’s position was that Ms. Young had a lending relationship elsewhere and that it was “unfortunate” that the lender had not started taking applications under the program when Bank of America turned her away. This week  Ms. Young joined a lawsuit against Bank of America filed by borrowers whom the bank turned away because they had credit cards from other banks. By joining the lawsuit  which is seeking class-action status  she met another Baltimore-based business owner  Amy Elias  who helped her apply for a government-backed loan through Fundera  online loan marketplace. She is awaiting the outcome of the application. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/business/10virus-minoritybiz1/10virus-minoritybiz1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/19/reader-center/author-emily-flitter/author-emily-flitter-thumbLarge.png 
10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/coronavirus-workplace-automation.html, business, Robots Welcome to Take Over  as Pandemic Accelerates Automation, Broad unease about losing jobs to machines could dissipate as people focus on the benefits of minimizing close human contact., Supported by Broad unease about losing jobs to machines could dissipate as people focus on the benefits of minimizing close human contact. By Michael Corkery and David Gelles The recycling industry was already struggling before the pandemic. Now  an increasing number of cities are suspending recycling services  partly out of fear that workers might contract the coronavirus from one another while sorting through used water bottles  food containers and boxes. One solution: Let robots do the job. Since the coronavirus took hold in the United States last month  AMP Robotics has seen a “significant” increase in orders for its robots that use artificial intelligence to sift through recycled material  weeding out trash. “Some facilities that were looking at getting one or two robots are now saying  ‘We need quite a bit more ’” said the Colorado company’s chief executive  Matanya Horowitz. “It’s all moving quite fast.” Before the pandemic  automation had been gradually replacing human work in a range of jobs  from call centers to warehouses and grocery stores  as companies looked to cut labor costs and improve profit. But labor and robotics experts say social-distancing directives  which are likely to continue in some form after the crisis subsides  could prompt more industries to accelerate their use of automation. And long-simmering worries about job losses or a broad unease about having machines control vital aspects of daily life could dissipate as society sees the benefits of restructuring workplaces in ways that minimize close human contact. “Pre-pandemic  people might have thought we were automating too much ” said Richard Pak  a professor at Clemson University who researches the psychological factors around automation. “This event is going to push people to think what more should be automated.” The grocery industry is leaning more on automation to free up employees to deal with the crush of demand during the pandemic. Brain Corp  a San Diego company that makes software used in automated floor cleaners  said retailers were using the cleaners 13 percent more than they were just two months ago. The “autonomous floor care robots” are doing about 8 000 hours of daily work “that otherwise would have been done by an essential worker ” the company said. At supermarkets like Giant Eagle  robots are freeing up employees who previously spent time taking inventory to focus on disinfecting and sanitizing surfaces and processing deliveries to keep shelves stocked. Retailers insist the robots are augmenting the work of employees  not replacing them. But as the panic buying ebbs and sales decline in the recession that is expected to follow  companies that reassigned workers during the crisis may no longer have a need for them. The role of a cashier is also changing. For many years  retailers have provided self-checkout kiosks. But those machines often require intervention by workers to help shoppers navigate the often fickle and frustrating technology. The pandemic is prompting some stores to adopt even more aggressive “contactless” options. From farm stands to butchers  merchants are asking customers whenever possible to use mobile payment services like PayPal or Venmo. Banking regulators in Europe last week increased the amount of money that shoppers can pay through their mobile devices  while reducing some authentication requirements. While fully automated stores  such as Amazon Go  might have seemed like a technological curiosity a few months ago  they are likely to become a more viable option for retailers. “No one would probably have thought of a cashier’s job as being dangerous until now ” Mr. Pak said. Mark Muro  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies labor markets  said that with companies hurting for cash  the pressure to replace humans with machines becomes even more intense. “People become more expensive as companies’ revenues decline ” he said. A new wave of automation could also mean that when companies start hiring again  they do so in smaller numbers. “This may be one of those situations when automation does substantially depress rehiring ” Mr. Muro said. “You may see fewer workers when the recovery does come.” Even some conversations are being automated away. With closed offices keeping many of its workers away  PayPal has turned to chatbots  using them for a record 65 percent of message-based customer inquiries in recent weeks. PayPal is also using automated translation services so its English-speaking representatives can help customers who don’t speak English. “The resources we are able to deploy through A.I. are allowing us to be more flexible with our staff and prioritize their safety and well-being ” PayPal said in a statement. YouTube said in a blog post that with fewer people in its offices around the world  machines are doing more content moderation. “We will temporarily start relying more on technology to help with some of the work normally done by reviewers ” the company said. “This means automated systems will start removing some content without human review.” Recycling is one industry that may be altered permanently by the pandemic. Some workers  who earn as little as $10 an hour  have been concerned about coming to work during the crisis and some cities have been scrambling to find enough protective gear for all of their employees. Federal health officials have assured them that the risks of transmission from household refuse is low. But workers in recycling facilities often work side by side sorting material  making social distancing difficult. At AMP Robotics  executives like Mr. Horowitz say their robots will enable recycling facilities to space out their employees  who stand at conveyor belts weeding through the used plastic and paper. Another benefit of the bots: “They can’t get the virus ” Mr. Horowitz said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/sports/soccer-secrets-hacker-rui-pinto-football-leaks.html, sports, Soccer Secrets Hacker Leaves Prison  Enters Lockdown, Rui Pinto  the hacker whose revelations shook soccer by shining a light on its darkest secrets  is released from prison and put under house arrest., Supported by Rui Pinto  the hacker whose revelations shook soccer by shining a light on its darkest secrets  is released from prison and put under house arrest. By Tariq Panja For Rui Pinto  it is a measure of a return to normal life. All the more so because much of the rest of Portugal’s 10 million inhabitants are also confined to their homes under restrictions imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In recent years  Pinto  the Portuguese computer hacker  has garnered almost as much attention as the country’s most famous soccer stars. He revealed some of their secrets in a startling series of leaks that shook the global soccer industry and beyond for almost four years until he was apprehended in Budapest and extradited to Portugal to answer 147 charges. Until Wednesday  Pinto  31  had languished in preventive custody in a Lisbon jail for more than a year awaiting trial. An international coalition  including his lawyers and others  believed he should be granted whistle-blower status for the crimes and wrongdoing his leaks had exposed. Pinto’s lawyers have since announced that he had been released and placed under house arrest on the condition that he not use the internet. New details of Pinto’s situation have emerged. He is staying in a small apartment owned by Portugal’s judicial police  and the release is linked to the possibility of Pinto sharing the passwords of 10 encrypted hard drives that were seized when the apartment in Budapest in which he was tracked down was raided. The hard drives may hide a trove of new investigative material for the authorities in Portugal and beyond. The information Football Leaks made public — including player contracts  internal team financial documents and confidential emails — pulled back the curtain on the murky world of soccer finance  led to criminal tax prosecutions of several top players and even helped prompt officials in the United States to reopen a sexual assault investigation involving the Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo. (Officials in Las Vegas eventually decided not to pursue charges against Ronaldo.) Pinto also burrowed into the servers of several Portuguese entities  including the top-division soccer team Sporting Clube de Portugal  the national soccer federation  a well-known law firm and even the country’s attorney general’s office. The coronavirus crisis played a direct role in allowing Pinto to leave prison. On one hand  the judge said  Pinto had shown willingness to work with the police; on the other  the pandemic had meant Portugal’s borders were subject to heightened controls  reducing the opportunity for Pinto to flee the country. The repercussions of Pinto’s efforts continue to roil the soccer industry. Players and clubs have faced punishment from sporting and state authorities  and investigations into tax avoidance continue in several European countries. His material was also responsible for European soccer’s governing body opening an investigation and then punishing English soccer champion Manchester City with a two-season ban from European competitions like the Champions League for breaching financial regulations. City is appealing. Most recently  and most dramatically  in January  Pinto was revealed to be the source behind leaked documents and emails that revealed how Isabel dos Santos  Africa’s richest woman and the daughter of Angola’s former president  had amassed her $2 billion fortune. Last month  a Portuguese judge ordered the seizure of all of dos Santos’s assets in the country  and in January Angolan prosecutors accused her of embezzlement and money laundering. Dos Santos denies all the allegations against her. The revelations were dubbed “Luanda Leaks” and were published by a consortium of international media outlets that included The New York Times. William Bourdon  a Paris-based lawyer on Pinto’s legal team  said he believed Pinto’s link to the dos Santos case has helped to change perceptions of Pinto in Portugal  where his supporters portray him as a genuine whistle-blower and his opponents paint a darker character. Bourdon has represented other high-profile people who leaked sensitive information into the public domain  including the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. One of the charges Pinto faces involves a soccer agency which Pinto is accused of attempting to extort by offering to delete confidential and highly damaging information in exchange for as much as 1 million euros. “I do think Luanda Leaks has been an earthquake ” Bourdon told The Times. “I do think it’s opened the eyes of the Portuguese people to his serious contribution.” Still  the charges against Pinto remain serious. The trial  despite the impact of the ongoing coronavirus crisis  is scheduled to take place later this summer. And there remains uncertainty over what Pinto’s cooperation with the Portuguese authorities can bring him. Portugal law does not allow cooperation agreements with criminally accused individuals  something that is commonplace in the United States. There are also concerns that the information gleaned by Pinto would be inadmissible in a Portuguese court because it was illegally obtained. For now  Pinto’s lawyers said  the plan is to try and get him moved to a larger  more comfortable accommodation than he currently finds himself in. As for what might be revealed next  Bourdon said there are likely to be a number of anxious individuals and institutions. “If we reach a point where all the data is used in Portugal  it will be a source of worry for those who are scared of being held to account ” he added.

10/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/sports/mike-leach-mississippi-state-racism.html, sports, Football Coach Undermines Racial Progress at Mississippi State, By tweeting an image of a woman knitting a noose  Mike Leach undercut the university’s reputation for broad-mindedness on matters of race connected to sports., Supported by By tweeting an image of a woman knitting a noose  Mike Leach undercut the university’s reputation for broad-mindedness on matters of race connected to sports. By Jeré Longman Mike Leach has not yet coached a football game at Mississippi State  but he has already undermined the university’s long-held reputation for progressivism through athletics in a state with a painful racial history. After sharing a meme on Twitter of a woman knitting a noose  Leach  59  this week was ordered by university officials to undergo sensitivity training  including museum visits and “listening sessions” with students  alumni and community groups. At least one player has said he will transfer because he considers Leach’s apology insincere and the university’s response insufficient. “That’s the prime example of why I need to leave Mississippi ” the player  Fabien Lovett  said. Leach  who was hired from Washington State in January  ignited the controversy last week with a coronavirus-related meme — which he later deleted — that featured a black-and-white image of an older white woman with knitting needles. The caption read  “After 2 weeks of quarantine with her husband  Gertrude decided to knit him a scarf.” But the woman was knitting a noose  not a scarf  evoking the Deep South’s brutal history of lynching black people. Leach apologized the next day with a tweet that said: “I sincerely regret if my choice of images in my tweets were found offensive. I had no intention of offending anyone.” The apology did not sway Lovett  20  a defensive tackle from Vicksburg  Miss. Lovett said on Wednesday that he planned to transfer to another school. “We’re in the South ” Lovett said. “We’re in Mississippi. Stuff like that plays a huge role in our family  especially black men. Our ancestors were lynched.” Mississippi State declined to make its president  Mark Keenum  available on Thursday and did not respond to requests to interview Leach and Mississippi State’s athletic director  John Cohen. Cohen said in a statement this week that the university was disappointed in Leach. “No matter the context  for many Americans the image of a noose is never appropriate  and that’s particularly true in the South and in Mississippi ” Cohen said. Leach’s tweet conflicted with a history of broad-mindedness at Mississippi State on matters of race and sports  sometimes amid tension and unease over desegregation. In 1963  its all-white men’s basketball team famously sneaked out of the state  defying Mississippi’s segregationist governor  to play an N.C.A.A. tournament game — now known as the Game of Change — against Loyola of Chicago  which started four black players. In 2003  Mississippi State became the first university in the Southeastern Conference to hire a black head football coach  Sylvester Croom. Its powerful women’s basketball team  with a coaching staff and a roster consisting mostly of women of color  reached the national championship game two of the past three years. The team was highly ranked again when the 2020 N.C.A.A. men’s and women’s tournaments were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mississippi State responded exactly as it should have in condemning Leach’s remarks and insisting on sensitivity training for him  said Daniel W. Jones  a former chancellor of the University of Mississippi during a period when several school leaders barred Confederate symbols and the song “Dixie” from sporting events there. “I don’t think that a single coach coming from outside of the Deep South  who doesn’t have an appreciation for how sensitive lynching is here  is going to put a black eye on the university ” Jones said. “I think it puts a black eye on that coach. He’s going to have to be sensitive to those issues. And being sensitive is not one of his strengths  on the record at least.” Jones said Leach had always been known as a lax speaker. “And being loose with words about some things in Texas and Washington State are very different than the mistake he made here in Mississippi ” he said. Leach previously coached at Texas Tech as well as at Washington State. He is known for his innovative passing offense and his infatuation with pirate lore. His offbeat  garrulous nature has produced humorous remarks but has also landed him in hot water with university officials as he clumsily balanced his public position as a football coach with his private political views. In February  weeks after being hired at Mississippi State  Leach made critical remarks on Twitter — and then deleted them — about Senator Mitt Romney of Utah  the only Republican to vote to convict President Trump during his impeachment trial. One tweet from Leach  who is a Trump supporter  said  “As an American  does ANYONE  REALLY want Mitt Romney on their side?!” In 2018  while at Washington State  Leach tweeted a doctored video that falsified remarks by President Barack Obama. University officials ultimately said the incident cost the school as much as $1.6 million in lost donations. And now Leach has undercut Mississippi State’s efforts to combat racism through classroom instruction  a lecture series and diversity workshops and training  said Margaret A. Hagerman  an assistant professor of sociology who studies race at the university. “I think to not understand the symbolic racial violence of an image of a noose in Mississippi reflects either a lack of education about racism or a lack of concern ” Hagerman said. “I hope it’s the former  because that can be changed.” Neil Vigdor contributed reporting.

By Stella Tan Our producer Stella Tan on today’s episode: I first heard about it from my roommate. As coronavirus cases climbed in the United States  she’d seen reports of Asian-Americans being targeted in New York City. Should she  a daughter of Chinese immigrants  wear a mask in public or not? She wasn’t sure which would draw more attention. I noticed the personal stories and articles picking up on social media. In wading through comments and in conversations with people around me  I felt a hunger both within and outside the Asian-American community to talk about this discrimination. But with the coverage came a lot of questions. What was reasonable caution  and what was bias? Did the severity of an attack change its newsworthiness? What was the right way to talk about these incidents when they felt newly threatening to some  but were already daily realities for others? Several of the articles mentioned a tweet from Jiayang Fan  whose writing I’ve admired for a long time. When our team decided to tackle the story of racism against Asian-Americans  I called her up  along with Michael Barbaro and producers Lynsea Garrison and Neena Pathak. What struck me about our conversation was how openly Jiayang grappled with her complicated feelings  and the many ways she turned over in her mind what had happened to her. She spoke of the paralysis she felt when a stranger looked directly at her and verbally assaulted her outside her apartment. But she also looked at herself in the eyes of her mother — an immigrant whose religion was survival  as Jiayang put it — who might shake her head at her daughter for making a big deal out of so little. And she imagined herself in the place of the stranger who accosted her. Had he lost a job  or a loved one  because of the pandemic? Was his anger just waiting for a target? She didn’t have answers. But she had a lot of memories — of how her earliest beliefs about identity were formed  of watching her mother pretend to be in on the joke when someone made fun of her pronunciation  of the pride she felt when she could say  “C’mon!” to a friend in English without thinking about it first. There’s one part of her story in particular where I saw a piece of myself. In today’s episode  you may have noticed warbly  dreamy sounds of a tiny voice speaking Mandarin. That comes from a cassette tape that Jiayang’s mother made with her in China in the 1980s. Jiayang told us that her mother would mail these cassettes overseas to her father in the U.S. in lieu of phone calls  which were too expensive. In the cassette tape  a 3-year-old Jiayang recites lines of Tang Dynasty verse that Chinese parents love to teach their children (sort of like “Humpty Dumpty ” but from 700 A.D.). As I listened to the tape  I realized that I’d heard recordings of myself reciting the same verses as a kid  but in Cantonese. When my mom and dad  as immigrants  found it difficult to take care of an infant while setting up their lives in a new country  my grandparents brought me back to Guangzhou  China  and raised me until I was 4. They did what Jiayang’s mom did  recording my early fumblings and sending them across the ocean. Those sonic postcards helped my parents hear my first words. Jiayang’s story is her own  but you might find echoes of yourself in it  too. Listen here. Talk to Stella on Twitter: @stellatan. A couple of weeks ago  Andy Mills helped produce an episode about the songs that are bringing a bit of relief to Jody Rosen  a writer for The Times Magazine. That got him thinking about his own coronavirus playlist. Here  Andy shares the artists and albums that are helping him during these uncertain times: Over the past several weeks of coronavirus confinement  I’ve been reaching deeper into my favorite records than I have in years. I’ve rediscovered “The Suburbs” by Arcade Fire  “The Age of Adz” by Sufjan Stevens and “Teen Dream” by Beach House. I’ve been bowled over by Sam Cooke  Smokey Robinson and Aretha Franklin. I’ve slow-danced in my room by myself to Benny Goodman. I’ve gone on walks with Merle Haggard  Hank Williams and Jackson Browne  and I’ve sung too loudly to every word by my beloved Fleetwood Mac (and  yes  maybe a little Jimmy Eat World  too). I’m surprised by the amount of pleasure I’ve found in spending Saturday mornings slowly alphabetizing my albums  placing Tom Petty just ahead of Tom Waits and Washed Out just behind The War On Drugs. These artists have helped me find escape in their anthems about finding your place in the world  about surviving hardships  and about love  which feels particularly therapeutic in these times when we cannot be embraced by our friends or surrounded by others. Monday: “You wake up two weeks later  and not only does your industry not have a job for you  your industry doesn’t really work anymore.” Jim Tankersly on how we got to the worst unemployment crisis in U.S. history. Tuesday: How and why do you hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic? Astead Herndon explains the “partisan bloodbath” in the lead-up to Wisconsin’s primary. Wednesday: The coronavirus pandemic pitted a captain of an aircraft carrier against the head of the Navy. Eric Schmitt on the crisis inside the service. Thursday: “It’s such a lonely  lonely virus. And people are dying by themselves.” We hear from Yanti Turang  an E.R. nurse on the frontlines in New Orleans. Friday: As the coronavirus crisis has escalated  so too have reports of verbal and physical attacks against Asian-Americans. Writer Jiayang Fan shares her story  and how it has helped reframe her conception of the U.S. Have thoughts about the show? Tell us what you think at thedaily@nytimes.com.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/climate/coronavirus-pollution-race.html, climate, Race  Pollution and the Coronavirus, Also this week: How to be ready for overlapping disasters, Supported by Climate FWD: Also this week: How to be ready for overlapping disasters By Lisa Friedman and Zoë Schlanger Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. New this month  for the 50th anniversary of Earth Day  The New York Times is bringing you The Greenhouse  a digital event series on climate change. Join us on our first live video call this Friday at 11:30 a.m. Eastern  where Times climate journalists Hannah Fairfield  Somini Sengupta  Nadja Popovich and John Schwartz will discuss climate in the age of the coronavirus. By Lisa Friedman Two important pieces of coronavirus research came out yesterday. One showed that African Americans are getting infected and dying from Covid-19 at disproportionately high rates. The other found that counties with higher levels of pollution are seeing greater numbers of coronavirus deaths than cleaner ones. The data in both reports is preliminary. But environmental experts said that together  the statistics pointed to a troubling story of vulnerability in communities of color. Multiple studies  including from Environmental Protection Agency scientists  have found that African Americans and other people of color tend to live in closer proximity to coal plants  refineries and other sites responsible for emitting fine particulate matter than whites. That microscopic pollution  which passes through the lungs and enters the bloodstream  has been linked to a variety of serious health problems  including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Those chronic health conditions  scientists say  increase vulnerability to the coronavirus. Sign up here to get the Climate Fwd: newsletter in your inbox. “Communities of color  they’ve always been the sacrifice zones ” Mustafa Ali  vice president of environmental justice  climate and community revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation  said in a video posted online Tuesday. “They’ve been the places where we’ve pushed things that nobody else wants.” Mr. Ali  who led the environmental justice program at the E.P.A. under President Barack Obama  connected the two pieces of independent research  saying long-term exposure to industrial pollution “makes us more susceptible to the pandemic.” There is much more to be learned. Many cities and states still are not reporting coronavirus data by race  and experts note that other factors  like income  also are in play. The pollution study  from the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health  looks at aggregated data from counties  not individual cases  so it offers little insight into the role pollution plays in susceptibility to the coronavirus. But when I spoke to Dr. John R. Balmes  a pulmonologist and spokesman for the American Lung Association  he said there was one immediate lesson: the urgency of ensuring that hospitals in the neighborhoods most at risk are prepared. As the coronavirus spreads  he said  “We need to make sure that hospitals taking care of folks who are more vulnerable and with even greater air pollution exposure have the resources they need.” By Zoë Schlanger Here’s something we might not want to think about right now  but probably should: The hurricane and wildfire seasons are just around the corner. That means some people wisely following advice to stay at home might have to leave those homes  fast. If you live in a wildfire  hurricane or flood zone  it’s always good to be ready for an evacuation order. But now  amid the coronavirus pandemic  it’s especially important — to protect yourself and others by minimizing the pressure on an already overburdened emergency response system. “Every citizen should understand what the specific risks might be to their individual communities ” said Dr. Irwin Redlener  director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. One of the most basic precautions is to make sure you can move when you need to. If your gas gauge is in the red  you won’t be going far. Try to make sure your vehicle has at least half a tank of fuel at all times. And  familiarize yourself with the evacuation routes around your community. They’re typically available on state emergency services websites  like this one for Florida. Next  make sure you can quickly grab the things you’ll need  like important documents and medication. Crucial papers include identification  insurance information and the deed to your home. If you take medication  maintain your supply. “Studies have shown that when you have a wildfire you definitely get an increase in asthma  pneumonia  COPD exacerbations  acute bronchitis ” said Dr. Mary Prunicki  the director of air pollution and health research at Stanford University’s center for allergy and asthma research. That makes it especially important to keep enough medication on hand if you have a condition like asthma. It’s also a good idea to have basic emergency supplies in your car if you live in a danger zone. They should include water  nonperishable food and a flashlight. The American Red Cross has more detailed guidelines on its website. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends stocking your kit with enough food and water for three days. If you have pets  you’ll need food and water for them  too. There are also home maintenance precautions you can take  depending on the risks in your area. If you live in a wildfire zone  clear the area within 30 feet of your house of brush and debris that could ignite and accelerate a fire. If you’re in a hurricane zone  now is a good time to unclog your rain gutters. No matter where you live  for homes that have gas  you should know where the valves are and how to shut them off. Hurricane season in the Atlantic is set to begin June 1  and experts predict four major Atlantic hurricanes this year. There’s an above-average chance that one of those will make landfall in the United States. While no individual storm can be attributed definitively to climate change  scientists know that global warming has made them more frequent and more ferocious. Meanwhile  the West is gearing up for wildfire season  which has begun earlier in recent years and lasted longer. In addition to the risks posed by quarantined firefighters and the difficulty of social distancing under potential evacuation orders  wildfires exacerbate lung conditions — something that we all want to avoid while the coronavirus is hanging around. The pandemic  Dr. Redlener said  is “not going to stop other disasters from happening.” We’d love your feedback on this newsletter. Please email thoughts and suggestions to climateteam@nytimes.com.

And be sure to check out our full assortment of free newsletters from The Times. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/climate/08CLI-NEWSLETTER/08CLI-NEWSLETTER-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-lisa-friedman/author-lisa-friedman-thumbLarge.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html, business economy, ‘Sudden Black Hole’ for the Economy With Millions More Unemployed, , Jobless claims now exceed 16 million as shutdowns from the coronavirus pandemic widen and problems with getting benefits persist. Credit... Supported by By Patricia Cohen and Tiffany Hsu With the coronavirus outbreak shutting businesses in every state  fresh evidence of the economic devastation was delivered Thursday as a government report showed that 6.6 million more workers had lost their jobs. The Labor Department announcement  reflecting last week’s filings for unemployment benefits  meant that more than 16 million people had been put out of work in just three weeks  an unheard-of figure. Two years of job losses from the last recession produced barely half that total. Many economists say the actual job losses so far are almost certainly greater  and there is wide agreement that they will continue to mount. It’s as if “the economy as a whole has fallen into some sudden black hole ” said Kathy Bostjancic  chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. The Federal Reserve redoubled its effort to break that fall on Thursday with an ambitious plan to help companies and state and local governments gain access to funding. The Fed said its new and expanded programs could pump $2.3 trillion into the economy. The central bank’s intervention was welcomed in financial markets  with the S&P 500 stock index ending the day with a gain of almost 1.5 percent. But additional relief from Washington hit a Senate roadblock over what to include. Republicans have proposed $250 billion to replenish a loan program for distressed small businesses  while Democrats want $250 billion more to assist hospitals and state and local governments dealing with coronavirus-related expenses and revenue shortfalls. What it will take to stabilize the economy is no more than guesswork  many analysts say. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent  and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce enacted to slow infections will be lifted. 6 million 16 780 000 5 Claims were filed in the last three weeks 4 Initial jobless claims  per week Seasonally adjusted 3 2 RECESSION 1 0 ’04 ’08 ’09 ’12 ’16 ’20 6 million 16 780 000 5 Claims were filed in the last three weeks 4 3 RECESSION 2 Initial jobless claims  per week Seasonally adjusted 1 0 ’04 ’08 ’09 ’12 ’16 ’20 16 780 000 6 million Claims were filed in the last three weeks 5 Initial jobless claims  per week 4 Seasonally adjusted 3 RECESSION 2 1 0 ’04 ’08 ’09 ’12 ’16 ’20 16 780 000 6 million Claims were filed in the last three weeks 5 4 3 RECESSION 2 Initial jobless claims  per week Seasonally adjusted 1 0 ’04 ’08 ’09 ’12 ’16 ’20 Source: Department of Labor By The New York Times Several economists expect that by the end of the month  more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work  pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 percent. In February  it was 3.5 percent  a result of 113 straight months of job growth. The country’s gross domestic product  the broadest measure of the goods and services produced  could fall this quarter at an annual rate of as much as 35 percent from the preceding three months. It is clear that this quarter will be “really terrible ” Ms. Bostjancic said. “We just don’t know the degree of terribleness.” Despite feverish efforts in many states to expand staffing and upgrade technological capacity  unemployment offices have been vastly overpowered by demand. Applicants in several of the hardest-hit places  like New York and California  say they’ve made dozens of attempts — even hundreds — to get through online or by telephone. Some have still not succeeded. Kendall Clark  an information technology recruiter in The Woodlands  Texas  said she had not managed to file despite more than 1 200 attempts  some at 1 a.m. “I’m stuck  I’m frustrated  and I don’t really know where to go from here ” said Ms. Clark  who lives with her husband and two sons. “The plan is that we don’t pay some bills  but pay the mortgage so we don’t lose the house.” Although each state sets the level and duration of its unemployment benefits  the federal $2 trillion emergency relief act passed two weeks ago expanded the program  widening eligibility and extending the period for compensation. Those payments will be crucial in helping families survive the crisis  said Robert G. Valletta  senior vice president and associate director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. “It’s exactly the kind of bridge that we need to make sure people are able to maintain some level of household stability and come out of this without complete devastation ” he said. Once the epidemic recedes  the hope is that many laid-off workers will be rehired. Even with a check from the government  though  covering bills can be a struggle. Lyn Douglass and her husband  William Hickey  who live in the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood  are feeling the pinch  even though California has relatively generous unemployment benefits. Mr. Hickey  40  who worked at an events planning company for the past 14 years  was furloughed at the end of March and has no idea when he will get his job back. “I’m in a bit of a limbo state right now ” he said. “It’s terrifying.” Ms. Douglass  a casting producer and a wedding videographer  said her work started to dry up a few weeks earlier. Now nearly all of her spring gigs have been canceled. They filed unemployment claims and have started receiving benefits  but said they had lost 75 percent of their average income. The state’s benefits can replace 60 to 70 percent of wages up to a maximum of $450  but  Ms. Douglass said  “it’s gotten to be so financially dire  I’m going to have to sell some of my cameras to pay rent.” The couple spent a day calling creditors asking for more lenient payment terms on their Target card  their cable bill and other expenses. Most were understanding  they said. “We have to prioritize what we’re purchasing — our cat food  our own food ” Ms. Douglass  40  said. “We would usually rent a movie on Vudu  but now that’s out the window. Every dime is important to us.” More than 925 000 new claims were filed in California alone last week. New York  Michigan  Florida  Georgia and Texas also saw big jumps in the number of new applicants. Although the national figures are seasonally adjusted  the state totals are not. Getting money immediately into the hands of people who need it not only helps households buy groceries and pay rent during an acute crisis but also aids in the economy’s recovery. “That helps to keep establishments open and running ” said Cathy Barrera  founding economist of the Prysm Group  and that could help prevent a short  sharp shock from turning into a prolonged slump after the epidemic ebbs. The government’s relief package — which includes low-interest loans and grants for businesses  ready cash for individuals and expanded unemployment insurance — was enacted with that goal in mind. Individuals should soon start receiving $1 200 emergency assistance checks. But Ms. Barrera worries that the expanded unemployment benefits won’t come through rapidly enough. “I am concerned that the way this relief has been channeled through the existing unemployment insurance system — which can be difficult to access in an expedient way — can be causing us some problems ” she said. Several states  including Connecticut  have warned that checks could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others  like Florida  start benefits only when a claim is filed  regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance  for example  allows workers who don’t normally qualify — like independent contractors  part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others  Kandy Thomas  a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City  found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that “these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs.” “There’s nothing for someone like me ” Ms. Thomas said. “As soon as you say you’re self-employed  you’re done.” Ms. Thomas  who lives with three rescue dogs and has five chickens  said she usually earned $5 000 to $6 000 a month and sometimes as much as $10 000. She was booked solid during the spring and had to turn some clients away  she said  but over three days last month  everyone canceled. She has no money coming in now. “This is the first time in 20 years I’ve had to worry ” she said. “I was like  oh  my God  my whole world’s falling apart. The first week  I was a mess. I was so depressed  so sickened. But you can’t worry about what you can’t control. I’m strong  and I always have been.” Normally  most states offer roughly half of a worker’s previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment  but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019  the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $215  and just 9 percent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments  according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts  the average weekly benefit was $550  and 57 percent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina  benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law  jobless workers will get an additional $600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks. Many states have yet to send out the $600 supplement. New York started issuing the additional money this week. The Texas Workforce Commission is working to start the payments by Sunday  a spokesman said. Other states estimate longer delays. In Utah  Ms. Thomas said she was not counting on receiving any jobless benefits  but plans to use the $1 200 stimulus check — when she receives it — to help cover some bills  including her business and health insurance. “Thank God for my chickens ” she said. “They’ve been giving me eggs when I can’t find any in the store.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/coronavirus-unemployment-washington.html, business, Virus Throws Millions More Out of Work  and Washington Struggles to Keep Pace, Federal efforts to keep businesses operating and workers employed have so far failed to stop the bleeding as the coronavirus tears through the economy in devastating ways., Supported by Federal efforts to keep businesses operating and workers employed have so far failed to stop the bleeding as the coronavirus tears through the economy in devastating ways. By Jim Tankersley WASHINGTON — When the federal government began rushing trillions of dollars of assistance to Americans crushed by the coronavirus pandemic  the hope was that some of the aid would allow businesses to keep workers on the payroll and cushion employees against job losses. But so far  a staggering number of Americans — more than 16 million — have lost their jobs amid the outbreak. Businesses continue to fail as retailers  restaurants  nail salons and other companies across the country run out of cash and close up shop as their customers are forced to stay at home. There is a growing agreement among many economists that the government’s efforts were too small and came too late in the fast-moving pandemic to prevent businesses from abandoning their workers. Federal agencies  working in a prescribed partnership with Wall Street  have proved ill equipped to move money quickly to the places it is needed most. An analysis by University of Chicago economists of data from Homebase  which supplies scheduling software for tens of thousands of small businesses that employ hourly workers in dining  retail and other sectors  suggests more than 40 percent of those firms have closed since the crisis began. The pandemic could cost the United States a quarter of its restaurants  said Cameron Mitchell  who owns and runs a chain of 21 restaurants in Ohio and has more across the country. He has furloughed all but six of the company’s 4 000 workers. “I’m not asking for a handout ” Mr. Mitchell said  but “we need some additional help  or else America’s not going to have a restaurant industry to come back to.” His chain  Cameron Mitchell Restaurants  had applied for a $10 million loan through Huntington National Bank but was awaiting confirmation from the Small Business Administration in Washington. Policymakers have tried to head off the economic devastation that businesses like Mr. Mitchell’s are now experiencing  but it has proved complicated. Congress and President Trump have already approved nearly $3 trillion in economic rescue packages aimed at countering the effects of the virus  including aid to companies that explicitly tries to keep workers tied to their jobs. The Federal Reserve has also created a flurry of new programs to keep the financial system from seizing up  including one effort announced Thursday that seeks to help nearly 19 000 businesses that have not otherwise obtained federal assistance. But the federal government is not equipped to quickly establish or manage complex funding programs  and by the time policymakers began those efforts  it was already too late for some businesses. Some companies have chosen to lay off workers  viewing that as a better option for them than keeping them on part time or paying just a fraction of their salaries. An expansion of unemployment benefits added $600 per week to the amount received by every laid-off American for the next four months  giving some companies an incentive to direct their workers to federal assistance. For many workers — those who earn up to $1 200 a week  depending on the state — that additional benefit means their unemployment pay could exceed what they were earning on the job. The discrepancy could encourage some companies to furlough workers. Small-business aid from an initial $349 billion pot has been slow to arrive for many companies already staring down the possibility of bankruptcy  with bureaucratic and technological hurdles bedeviling the program. The Paycheck Protection Program — which offers companies forgivable loans to continue covering their payroll — began taking applications only on April 3  weeks after many merchants had been ordered to close their doors. Very little of the more than $100 billion committed through it so far has actually made it into borrowers’ hands. Banks  which are expected to front the money for the program  are still battling bottlenecks at the overwhelmed Small Business Administration and are waiting for technical information they need to close and fund the loans. Smaller banks are on the verge of running out of cash to lend. They are relying on the Federal Reserve to quickly repurchase their paycheck program loans  which the Fed has said it will do  but it has not yet provided details on its plan. A program aimed at keeping airline employees on the payrolls is also in a holding pattern  as the Treasury Department vets applications from airlines and prepares to negotiate what the government will receive in exchange for bailing them out. And individual checks to help millions of Americans continue to pay bills are not expected to arrive until April 15  at the earliest Even the Fed’s “Main Street” lending program  announced Thursday  may prove insufficient for business needs. It operates through banks  so it still requires lenders to feel comfortable extending credit. And while they can sell most of the loans they originate — the Fed will buy 95 percent of eligible loans  up to $600 billion worth — the banks will still have to hang onto a tiny slice of risk. There is no clear date when the program will be up and running. Policymakers have moved faster  and appropriated far more money to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic  than American leaders did during the 2008 financial crisis  said Tony Fratto  who served in the George W. Bush administration during that crisis. But the response came too late to save many of the businesses that now face bankruptcy. “There’s creativity and there’s scale  and they’re trying to do it quickly ” Mr. Fratto said  “but they weren’t early enough  and there’s going to be a lot of damage because of that.” Lawmakers have agreed they will need to approve larger sums of money to help smaller businesses. But an effort by Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  to speed an additional $250 billion through the Senate failed on Thursday when Democrats objected because they wanted Mr. McConnell to tack on assistance to hospitals and local governments. Senators and advocacy groups have begun to push additional measures to bolster companies through the pandemic. Senator Josh Hawley  Republican of Missouri  wrote on Thursday that “the federal government should cover 80 percent of wages for workers at any U.S. business  up to the national median wage  until this emergency is over.” Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  said the government should provide cash assistance of up to $75 000 each for businesses that employ 50 workers or less. The Economic Innovation Group  a think tank in Washington that has pushed lawmakers to aid small businesses during the crisis  called on Congress to amend the program by adding more money to it  allowing individual businesses to borrow more and removing limits on spending from the loans for expenses other than payroll — like rent. Mr. Mitchell  the restaurant owner  also said he would like to see the spending limits for loans tweaked and the timeline for spending loan funds relaxed. Other countries have taken more direct steps to prevent the type of mass unemployment and widespread collapse of companies now facing the United States. France  Germany and a number of other European countries are paying employers not to lay people off by footing the bill for 80 to 90 percent of a furloughed worker’s salary. The idea is to limit layoffs and company closures  so that when the coronavirus is finally under control  Europe’s businesses and economies can rebound from the recession with less pain than if unemployment had been allowed to soar. More than seven million employees in France have been put on paid furlough directly financed by the government  which is spending 45 billion euros to keep workers employed and companies afloat. Use of Germany’s paid furlough program is also soaring  with nearly a half-million firms filing for support in March  including Daimler  Volkswagen and Lufthansa. Congress seems unlikely to adopt a similar program  or even something akin to what Mr. Hawley proposed on Thursday. And while Mr. Trump has promised a “boom” in the economy in the weeks to come — foreshadowing a push to lift the restrictions officials have placed on activity — many economists disagree. Forecasters at Moody’s Analytics warned on Thursday that some 45 million Americans were at risk of losing their jobs amid the pandemic  including three-quarters of the workers in the hospitality and construction industries. They warned it was a “conservative estimate.” “Most businesses are struggling with reduced demand ” the forecasters wrote  “as consumers shift their spending to necessities and cut back on the rest.” Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport  Emily Cochrane and Jeanna Smialek from Washington; Liz Alderman from Paris; Patricia Cohen  Stacy Cowley and Emily Flitter from New York; and Noam Scheiber from Chicago. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/business/09DC-VIRUS-RESCUE-01/09DC-VIRUS-RESCUE-01-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbLarge.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/coronavirus-equipment-rich-poor.html, world, In Scramble for Coronavirus Supplies  Rich Countries Push Poor Aside, Developing nations in Latin America and Africa cannot find enough materials and equipment to test for coronavirus  partly because the United States and Europe are outspending them., Supported by Developing nations in Latin America and Africa cannot find enough materials and equipment to test for coronavirus  partly because the United States and Europe are outspending them. By Jane Bradley Crates of masks snatched from cargo planes on airport tarmacs. Countries paying triple the market price to outbid others. Accusations of “modern piracy” against governments trying to secure medical supplies for their own people. As the United States and European Union countries compete to acquire scarce medical equipment to combat the coronavirus  another troubling divide is also emerging  with poorer countries losing out to wealthier ones in the global scrum for masks and testing materials. Scientists in Africa and Latin America have been told by manufacturers that orders for vital testing kits cannot be filled for months  because the supply chain is in upheaval and almost everything they produce is going to America or Europe. All countries report steep price increases  from testing kits to masks. The huge global demand for masks  alongside new distortions in the private market  has forced some developing countries to turn to UNICEF for help. Etleva Kadilli  who oversees supplies at the agency  said it was trying to buy 240 million masks to help 100 countries but so far had managed to source only around 28 million. “There is a war going on behind the scenes  and we’re most worried about poorer countries losing out ” said Dr. Catharina Boehme  the chief executive of Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics  which collaborates with the World Health Organization in helping poorer countries gain access to medical tests. In Africa  Latin America and parts of Asia  many countries are already at a disadvantage  with health systems that are underfunded  fragile and often lacking in necessary equipment. A recent study found that some poor countries have only one equipped intensive care bed per million residents. So far  the developing world has reported far fewer cases and deaths from the coronavirus  but many experts fear that the pandemic could be especially devastating for the poorest countries. Testing is the first defense against the virus and an important tool to stop so many patients from ending up hospitalized. Most manufacturers want to help  but the niche industry that produces the testing equipment and chemical reagents necessary to process lab tests is dealing with huge global demand. “There’s never really been a shortage of chemical reagents before now ” said Doris-Ann Williams  chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association  which represents producers and distributors of the lab tests used to detect coronavirus. “If it was just one country with an epidemic it would be fine  but all the major countries in the world are wanting the same thing at the same time.” For poorer countries  Dr. Boehme said the competition for resources is potentially a “global catastrophe ” as a once-coherent supply chain has rapidly devolved into an arm-twisting exercise. Leaders of “every country” are personally calling manufacturing chief executives to demand first-in-line access to vital supplies. Some governments have even offered to send private jets. In Brazil  Amilcar Tanuri cannot offer private jets. Dr. Tanuri runs public laboratories at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro  half of which are “stuck doing nothing ” instead of testing health workers  because he said the chemical reagents he needs are being routed to wealthier countries. “If you don’t have reliable tests  you are blind ” he said. “This is the beginning of the epidemic curve so I’m very concerned about the public health system here being overwhelmed very fast.” Brazil is Latin America’s hardest hit country so far  with more than 10 000 confirmed cases and a testing backlog of at least 23 000. It is also the region’s most controversial player in the pandemic  with a president  Jair Bolsonaro  who has been an outspoken skeptic of the risks posed by the coronavirus. But below the political noise  the country’s scientists began trying to ramp up testing hours after the country’s first case was announced. Yet within weeks  Dr. Tanuri was left to frantically call private firms on three continents  trying to source the chemical reagents needed for the 200 testing samples his labs receive every day — only to be told that the United States and Europe had already bought up months of production. “If we purchase something to arrive in 60 days  it’s too late ” he said. “The virus goes faster than we can go.” The situation is similar for some African countries. After reporting its first death on March 27  South Africa moved swiftly  introducing a strict lockdown and announcing ambitious house-to-house canvassing that has already seen 47 000 people tested. South Africa has more than 200 public labs  an impressive network that surpasses wealthier countries like Britain and was developed in response to past outbreaks of H.I.V. and tuberculosis. But  like Brazil  it is reliant on international manufacturers for the chemical reagents  and other equipment  needed to process the tests. Dr. Francois Venter  an infectious diseases expert who is advising the South African government  said the struggle to acquire the reagents was endangering the country’s overall response. “We have the capacity to do large testing  but we’ve been bedeviled by the fact the actual testing materials  reagents  haven’t been coming ” he said. “We’re not as wealthy. We don’t have as many ventilators  we don’t have as many doctors  our health system was in a precarious position before coronavirus.” “The country is terrified ” he added. To address the problem  South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Services has set up a “war room” of around 20 people who are continuously calling different suppliers — yet running into problems sourcing the test kits and protective equipment they need. “The suppliers are basically saying their production output does not meet the needs ” said Dr. Kamy Chetty  the director of the agency. “They are working flat out.” Experts say that the industry that produces test kits is quite small. Ms. Williams  the industry representative in Britain  said there was no shortage of chemical reagents but that delays were arising in the production process  including the necessary checks and approvals  because the huge demand was overwhelming the system. “Manufacturers don’t just want to sell to rich countries ” said Paul Molinaro  head of supply and logistics for the World Health Organization. “They want to diversify  but they’ve got all this competing demand from different governments.” He added: “When it comes to the sharp end of a hypercompetitive environment with price rises  these low- and middle-income countries are going to end up at the back of the queue.” Last week  President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to prohibit the export of face masks to other countries and demand that American firms increase production of medical supplies. One American company that makes masks  3M  responded by warning of “significant humanitarian implications” if it stopped supplying masks to Latin America and Canada. This week  the company and the Trump administration reached a deal that allows 3M to continue exporting to developing countries  while also providing the United States with 166 million masks over the next few months. Last month  Europe and China introduced their own export restrictions on tests and protective equipment. Some private firms  however  are putting profit aside to help developing countries with more fragile health systems. A British testing manufacturer  Mologic  has received government funding to develop a 10-minute home coronavirus test in partnership with Senegal that  if approved  would cost less than $1 to produce. It would not be reliant on labs  electricity or sourcing expensive supplies from global manufacturers. Mologic agreed to share its technology with Institut Pasteur de Dakar  a flagship lab in Dakar  to help produce the kit “at cost.” While the goal is to make it widely available  it is predominantly aimed at slowing the spread of the virus in Africa. For poorer countries  the supply problem is bigger than just testing. Zambia is at the very beginning of its epidemic curve with only one death so far  but it is already struggling to source masks  as well as testing materials like swabs and reagents  says Charles Holmes  a board member of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia and the former chief medical officer for the Obama administration’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  known as PEPFAR. When Zambia tried to place an order for N95 masks  Dr. Holmes said  the broker tried to sell them for “five to 10 times” more than the usual cost  despite checks revealing the masks expired in 2016. “It’s difficult for countries or governments having those conversations with manufacturers  when much wealthier countries are having those same conversations ” he said. “The private sector is likely to respond to the highest bidder for many of these supplies  that’s just business.” He said manufacturers have told Zambian officials that they cannot guarantee a delivery date for supplies because “most of them are being snapped up by the U.S. and Europe.” While few would criticize governments for looking out for their own people  health experts believe that it is in everyone’s interest to help poorer countries get the supplies they need. “An infection with a highly transportable respiratory virus anywhere in the world puts all countries at risk ” Dr. Holmes said. “Wealthy nations not only have an obligation to look out for countries that are going to struggle  but they should also have some self interest in ensuring that the pandemic is contained in developing countries.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

Credit... Supported by By Annie Correal and Andrew Jacobs Photographs by Ryan Christopher Jones Anil Subba  a Nepali Uber driver from Jackson Heights  Queens  died just hours after doctors at Elmhurst Hospital thought he might be strong enough to be removed from a ventilator. In the nearby Corona neighborhood  Edison Forero  44  a restaurant worker from Colombia  was still burning with fever when his housemate demanded he leave his rented room  he said. Not far away in Jackson Heights  Raziah Begum  a widow and nanny from Bangladesh  worries she will be ill soon. Two of her three roommates already have the symptoms of Covid-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus. Everyone in the apartment is jobless  and they eat one meal a day  she said. “We are so hungry  but I am more terrified that I will get sick ” said Ms. Begum  53  who has diabetes and high blood pressure. In a city ravaged by the coronavirus  few places have suffered as much as central Queens  where a seven-square-mile patch of densely packed immigrant enclaves recorded more than 7 000 cases in the first weeks of the outbreak. Across New York  there was a relatively encouraging sign on Thursday: Hospitalizations remained nearly flat for the first time since the lockdown began. Still  officials cautioned that it was too early to tell if the trend would hold. Deaths have continued to climb  and the state reached a new one-day high of 799  according to figures released Thursday. Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey  which has had more deaths than any other state besides New York  also said the curve of infection seemed to be flattening in his state. He and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that social distancing measures would need to stay in place to keep up the early progress. In the month since the virus exploded in New York  it has claimed rich and poor  the notable and the anonymous. But as the death toll has mounted  the contagion has exposed the city’s stubborn inequities  tearing through working-class immigrant neighborhoods far more quickly than others. A group of adjoining neighborhoods — Corona  Elmhurst  East Elmhurst and Jackson Heights — have emerged as the epicenter of New York’s raging outbreak. As of Wednesday  those communities  with a combined population of about 600 000  had recorded more than 7 260 coronavirus cases  according to data collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Manhattan  with nearly three times as many people  had about 10 860 cases. Health officials have not released data on the race or ethnicity of the people who are sick  and officials from the Department of City Planning cautioned against drawing broad conclusions based on ZIP codes  which is how the city has released limited information about positive cases. Yet health care workers and community leaders say it is indisputable that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic day laborers  restaurant workers and cleaners who make up the largest share of the population in an area often celebrated as one of the most diverse places on earth. Latinos comprise 34 percent of the deaths in New York City  the largest share for any racial or ethnic group  according to data released by state officials on Wednesday. The neighborhoods also have large communities of Indian  Bangladeshi  Chinese  Filipino and Nepali people  and a score of other ethnicities that have been devastated by the pandemic. The city-run Elmhurst Hospital Center was one of the earliest and hardest-hit by the virus. Dozens of Covid-19 patients have clogged hallways as they wait for beds  terrified  alone and often unable to communicate in English. “We’re the epicenter of the epicenter ” said Councilman Daniel Dromm  who represents Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. He became emotional as he took stock of losses that included five friends and more than two dozen constituents. “This has shaken the whole neighborhood ” he said. In their daily toll of the fallen  city and state health officials have not disclosed where exactly deaths are occurring. But community leaders and organizers have kept their own tallies  providing a window into the virus’s disproportionate impact on immigrant communities. Some of the more prominent names in Queens include the Rev. Antonio Checo  a pastor at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights; Lorena Borjas  a transgender activist; and Kamal Ahmed  the president of the Bangladesh Society. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance said 28 drivers had died — the vast majority of them immigrants living in Queens — and Make the Road New York  an advocacy organization that serves the area’s working-class Latinos  said eight of its members in Queens had died. “A tragedy is unfolding ” said the co-director  Javier H. Valdés. The crisis has transformed the neighborhood. Roosevelt Avenue  the vital commercial artery that normally bustles with taquerias  arepa stands  threading salons and shops selling newspapers in dozens of languages  has all but shut down. The eerie silence is intermittently broken by sirens and the clattering of trains on elevated tracks. A handful of street vendors have returned  but now they sell masks and dress in Tyvek suits. With churches and mosques closed  families of the dead can mourn only at home. The chockablock density that defines this part of Queens may have also have been its undoing. Doctors and community leaders say poverty  notoriously overcrowded homes and government inaction left residents especially vulnerable to the virus. “I don’t think the city communicated the level of danger ” said Claudia Zamora  the interim deputy director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment  an advocacy group and worker center in Jackson Heights. In early March  she said  city health officials sent out fliers with hand-washing tips  but not the outreach workers and multilingual posters that might have conveyed the looming peril. The sick now include laborers like Ángel  39  a construction worker from Ecuador who asked that only his first name be used because of his immigration status. Like many  he said he worked at a Manhattan construction site until he fell ill. He said he was turned away from Elmhurst Hospital because his symptoms were not deemed life-threatening and had been suffering in the apartment in Corona he shares with three other workers. “I don’t have anyone to help me ” he said. City officials rejected the suggestion that they left the city’s immigrant neighborhoods to fend for themselves. The Department of Health  officials said  created coronavirus fact sheets in 15 languages. Officials mounted multilingual public service campaigns in subways and on television  and have provided continuous updates to the ethnic media including on the need for social distancing. Ronny Barzola  a 28-year-old Ecuadorean-American from nearby Kew Gardens who works for the food delivery service Caviar  is one of the lucky few to still have a job. He slathers his hands with sanitizer throughout the day but worries about his mother and sister  both of whom are sick at home but have been unable to get tested. “It’s impossible to isolate when everyone is sharing the same apartment ” he said. Mr. Subba  a longtime driver for services including Uber and Via  had stopped driving last month after picking up a sick passenger  said a cousin  Munindra Nembang  who added that Mr. Subba  49  had been diabetic. His wife and two of his children were also infected. Hundreds of other Nepali immigrants are sick  too  he said  including another Uber driver  who died on Wednesday. “Some are in I.C.U.  some are on ventilator  some are in the queue ” Mr. Nembang said. “We feel very sad.” Many residents struggled with poor health long before the coronavirus arrived. Dr. Dave Chokshi  chief population health officer for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation  said rates of diabetes  high blood pressure and other chronic conditions in central Queens were considerably higher than the city average. Compounding the crisis  many residents lack health insurance and depend on public hospitals for even routine procedures  said Diana Ramírez Barón  a doctor at Grameen VidaSana  a clinic in Jackson Heights for undocumented women. “They tell them to stay home and call your physician ” she said  referring to public health guidelines for people believed to have the coronavirus. “But they don’t have a physician. They get scared and they go to the E.R.” The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has begun a special Covid-19 relief campaign. All proceeds will go to nonprofits that provide assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation via GoFundMe. Patricia Rivera  a Mexican immigrant  said she had kept her distance from her mother’s household in East Elmhurst as the virus ripped through its seven members last month  infecting all but one. But then her mother  who was struggling to breathe  needed to be taken to the hospital. Ms. Rivera  38  took her to Flushing Hospital Medical Center  but came home worried she would infect her own crowded household  which includes a 70-year-old uncle. She found some N95 respirator masks given to a son on a construction job  and handed them out to her family. “Fear is what we’re all feeling ” said Ms. Rivera  who is working for a laundromat  carrying laundry to and from quarantined homes. For many  the fear of getting sick is heightened by the prospect of becoming homeless. Johana Marin  33  a waitress from Jackson Heights  said she spent several days in the hospital. “I thought I was going to die and never see my family in Colombia again ” she said. When she was discharged  she said  the woman who rented her a room refused to let her stay. Ms. Marin found refuge in the apartment of an aunt who she said was now pressing her to leave. Mr. Dromm  the councilman  said such stories were increasingly common and he urged the city to convert empty hotel rooms into temporary housing for those discharged from the hospital or patients with mild symptoms who were at risk of infecting others. City officials say they are working to address the problem. The challenges of dealing with the dead are becoming clear  as officials discuss digging temporary graves and families call on consulates to help them repatriate the deceased to their home countries. In the meantime  the needs of the living keep growing. Thousands have lost jobs  and the undocumented have so far been excluded from federal government aid. At a food pantry run in nearby Flushing by the nonprofit organization La Jornada  the vast majority of visitors were  until recently  single mothers. Now two-thirds are men trying to feed their families  said the director  Pedro Rodríguez  who worried the number of jobless residents would soon prove overwhelming. “A tsunami is coming ” he said. Despite the growing despair  many are finding ways to help others. Mexican grandmothers share recipes for traditional herbal fever remedies  Pakistani drivers deliver home-cooked meals and Nepali volunteers — including Mr. Nembang  the cousin of the driver who died — are distributing protective gear to those who must keep working. For thousands of people  however  life has been reduced to the dimensions of tiny rented rooms. Ms. Begum  the former nanny from Bangladesh  said she was riddled with fear. She spends her days compulsively cleaning the apartment’s bathroom and steering clear of her ailing roommates. The landlord has been demanding April rent and threatening eviction. For succor  Ms. Begum turns to the Quran she keeps beside her bed. “I am praying every day ” she said. “Praying that the coronavirus leaves America.” Somini Sengupta  Paula Moura  Jo Corona and Ryan Christopher Jones contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.

If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.

Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-press-briefing.html, us politics, Trump Keeps Talking. Some Republicans Don’t Like What They’re Hearing., Aides and allies increasingly believe the president’s daily briefings are hurting him more than helping  and are urging him to let his medical experts take center stage., Supported by Aides and allies increasingly believe the president’s daily briefings are hurting him more than helping  and are urging him to let his medical experts take center stage. By Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — In his daily briefings on the coronavirus  President Trump has brandished all the familiar tools in his rhetorical arsenal: belittling Democratic governors  demonizing the media  trading in innuendo and bulldozing over the guidance of experts. It’s the kind of performance the president relishes  but one that has his advisers and Republican allies worried. As unemployment soars and the death toll skyrockets  and new polls show support for the president’s handling of the crisis sagging  White House allies and Republican lawmakers increasingly believe the briefings are hurting the president more than helping him. Many view the sessions as a kind of original sin from which all of his missteps flow  once he gets through his prepared script and turns to his preferred style of extemporaneous bluster and invective. Mr. Trump “sometimes drowns out his own message ” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  who has become one of the president’s informal counselors and told him “a once-a-week show” could be more effective. Representative Susan Brooks of Indiana said “they’re going on too long.” Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said the briefings were “going off the rails a little bit” and suggested that he should “let the health professionals guide where we’re going to go.” Even the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board chastised the president for his behavior at the briefings. “Covid-19 isn’t shifty Schiff ” it wrote in an editorial on Thursday  using Mr. Trump’s nickname for Representative Adam Schiff. “It’s a once-a-century threat to American life and livelihood.” With only intermittent attempts to adapt to a moment of crisis  Mr. Trump is effectively wagering that he can win re-election in the midst of a national emergency on a platform of polarization. In interviews  Republican lawmakers  administration officials and members of his re-election campaign said they wanted Mr. Trump to limit his error-filled appearances at the West Wing briefings and move more aggressively to prepare for the looming recession. Some even suggested he summon a broader range of the country’s leaders  including former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama  in an all-hands-on-deck moment to respond to the national emergency. The consternation reflects a new sense of urgency over Mr. Trump’s re-election efforts as Joseph R. Biden Jr. emerges as his likely Democratic challenger. Three new polls this week show Mr. Biden leading the president  and the Trump campaign’s internal surveys show he has mostly lost the initial bump he received early in the crisis  according to three people briefed on the numbers. Public polls show he badly trails the nation’s governors and his own medical experts in terms of whom Americans trust most for guidance. “I told him your opponent is no longer Joe Biden — it’s this virus ” Mr. Graham said. One of Mr. Trump’s top political advisers  speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger the president  was even blunter  arguing that the White House was handing Mr. Biden ammunition each night by sending the president out to the cameras. Vice President Mike Pence  this adviser said  should be the M.C. because he projects more empathy than the president  rarely makes mistakes and  as a former governor and the chief of the coronavirus task force  has a better grasp on the details of the response. Yet the publicity-obsessed president is unlikely to relinquish his grip on the evening sessions: Mr. Trump has told aides he relishes the free television time and boffo ratings that come with his appearances  administration officials say. He also views it as an opportunity to put forth his version of events and rebut the negative coverage he is receiving  as he showed in a tweet Thursday afternoon. On a day that New York State reported 799 deaths from the coronavirus in a 24-hour period  Mr. Trump’s focus was on himself  and his feuds. There is some preliminary evidence that Mr. Trump is heeding the Republicans’ concerns. On Wednesday and Thursday  Mr. Trump made what were for him relatively brief appearances before leaving the room and turning the podium over to Mr. Pence and Drs. Anthony S. Fauci and Deborah Birx. Whether it lasts remains to be seen. Deep divisions remain in the White House and the Republican Party over how quickly to ease social distancing orders and urge Americans to return to school and work. Some who have Mr. Trump’s ear  like Mr. Graham  are urging prudence. But a number of Republican lawmakers and Fox News personalities are lobbying the president to reopen the economy as quickly as possible. Amid the conflicting advice  the president’s gut instincts and fondness for showmanship have won out  prompting him to frequently contradict or simply obscure the scientists who polls show are most trusted by voters. And it’s not just an overwhelming majority of voters who believe the medical experts should be center stage: Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  personally urged Mr. Trump at the start of the crisis to let Drs. Fauci and Birx be the face of the response  according to a Republican official familiar with their conversation. Judd Deere  a White House spokesman  said: “Any suggestion that President Trump is struggling on tone or message is completely false. During these difficult times  Americans are receiving comfort  hope and resources from their president  as well as their local officials  and Americans are responding in unprecedented ways.”  Some of Mr. Trump’s aides have quietly suggested to him that he ratchet back his public attacks on the governors who have emerged as leaders in the response to the virus. But they acknowledge their efforts can be something of a fool’s errand; the president has his style and he won’t change  they say. His attacks on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan  a popular Democrat and potential vice-presidential pick for Mr. Biden — whom Mr. Trump called a “half-Whit” and “that woman” — were of particular concern to some aides and political advisers  who believe he risked alienating voters in a pivotal state. Representative Paul Mitchell  a Michigan Republican  said he had contacted a senior White House official  as well as Ms. Whitmer herself  to express his unhappiness about their mutual sniping. “It is not helpful to hurl names and talk about badly about people ” Mr. Mitchell said. “We need to focus on the problem.” At Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign  staff members have closely monitored internal polling data showing an erosion of the gains Mr. Trump made immediately after he put social distancing guidelines in place. Advisers are torn between knowing that a less abrasive approach would help Mr. Trump and their awareness that he can’t tolerate criticism  regardless of the setting. Mr. Trump’s limited gains in the polls are all the more striking when compared with those made by governors in both parties; many are enjoying double-digit gains in their approval ratings. And Mr. Trump’s penchant for ad hominem attacks  Republicans say  illustrates why he has little room for growth among the electorate. “He can’t escape his instincts  his desire to put people down  like Mitt Romney  or to talk about his ratings ” said former Representative Carlos Curbelo  a Florida Republican. “That’s why he’s not getting the George W. Bush post-9/11 treatment. A leader in this sort of crisis should have a 75-to-80-percent approval rating.” That would prove difficult for even a more conventional president at a time the country is so politically divided  but a number of prominent Republicans believe Mr. Trump has hurt himself by making only the most halting attempts at demonstrating an above-the-fray unity. For example  aides to both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama said that neither had been asked by the White House to do anything to aid the response to the crisis. “The model of Obama asking Bush and Clinton to work on Haiti is a really good model ” said former Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee  recalling how Mr. Obama deployed Mr. Bush and former President Bill Clinton to lead the United States’ assistance to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake there. But Mr. Haslam and other Republicans believe Mr. Trump needs to go much further. Mr. Haslam called for creating a recovery team and installing “the economic equivalent of Dr. Fauci” as its leader. Asked whom he had in mind  Mr. Haslam suggested Mitch Daniels  who previously served as the governor of Indiana  the head of the Office of Management and Budget and as a top executive of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. A number of senators  including Mr. Graham  are also pushing for a sort of economic task force to complement the virus task force. “The administration needs to be thinking through what does it look like to get back to business ” said Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania  suggesting that it should “give a lot of thought to how we scale back up economically  because that’s going to be the next big challenge for us.” The health of the economy may pose the biggest challenge to Mr. Trump’s re-election. Mr. Toomey said he “won’t be surprised if we have 25 percent unemployment ” which would match the height of the Great Depression  by the start of the summer. But he said that if voters believed “the president has handled this well under the circumstances  and we’re on a good path  he has a shot.” Other Republicans are more skeptical that Mr. Trump can win if he’s still saddled with double-digit unemployment in November. “I think that makes it really hard ” said Tony Fratto  a former Bush administration official. And then there’s the matter of Mr. Trump and his conduct at the daily briefings. Mr. Toomey has been outspoken about the need for Americans to wear masks when they leave home. Last week he had a 20-minute conversation with the president  whom he described as “thoughtful and engaged.” By week’s end  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidelines: People should wear “cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” The agency’s decision was based in part on recent studies showing that people without symptoms can give the virus to others. But in the same briefing where he announced the guidelines  Mr. Trump diminished the move as “a recommendation.” “I just don’t want to wear one myself ” he said  explaining that he had no symptoms. “I am feeling good.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-chicken-meat-processing-plants-immigrants.html, us, Poultry Worker’s Death Highlights Spread of Coronavirus in Meat Plants, Some employees are coming in sick  and one woman died after being ordered back to work. “Our work conditions are out of control ” a longtime Tyson employee said., Supported by Some employees are coming in sick  and one woman died after being ordered back to work. “Our work conditions are out of control ” a longtime Tyson employee said. By Miriam Jordan and Caitlin Dickerson Annie Grant  55  had been feverish for two nights. Worried about the coronavirus outbreak  her adult children had begged her to stay home rather than return to the frigid poultry plant in Georgia where she had been on the packing line for nearly 15 years. But on the third day she was ill  they got a text from their mother. “They told me I had to come back to work ” it said. Ms. Grant ended up returning home  and died in a hospital on Thursday morning after fighting for her life on a ventilator for more than a week. Two other workers at the Tyson Foods poultry plant where she worked in Camilla  Ga.  have also died in recent days. “My mom said the guy at the plant said they had to work to feed America. But my mom was sick ” said one of Ms. Grant’s sons  Willie Martin  34  a teacher in South Carolina. He said he watched on his phone as his mother took her last breath. The coronavirus pandemic has reached the processing plants where workers typically stand elbow-to-elbow to do the low-wage work of cutting  deboning and packing the chicken and beef that Americans savor. Some plants have offered financial incentives to keep them on the job  but the virus’s swift spread is causing illness and forcing plants to close. Smithfield Foods’ pork plant in Sioux Falls  S.D.  announced Thursday that it would close temporarily  after more than 80 employees tested positive for the coronavirus. Workers have come down with Covid-19 in several poultry plants in Alabama  Georgia and Tennessee. JBS USA  the world’s largest meat processor  confirmed the death of one worker at a Colorado facility and shuttered a plant in Pennsylvania for two weeks. Cargill this week also closed a facility in Pennsylvania  where it produces steaks  ground beef and ground pork. Tyson halted operations at a pork plant in Iowa after more than two dozen workers tested positive. Industry analysts said the plant closures were unlikely to result in serious disruptions to the food supply. But if the pandemic keeps plants shuttered for an extended period  some products could become harder to find in stores  said Christine McCracken  a meat industry analyst at Rabobank in New York. “If workers don’t feel safe  they may not come back  and we don’t have a large pool of people that are lining up to work in these plants ” she said. At some plants  workers have staged walkouts over concerns that they are not being properly protected. But an untold number remain on the job  most of them African-Americans  Latinos and immigrants. The Trump administration has urged food-supply workers to step up to meet growing demand. “You are vital ” Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday. “You are giving a great service to the people of the United States of America and we need you to continue  as a part of what we call critical infrastructure  to show up and do your job.” Mr. Pence said the administration would work “tirelessly” to ensure the workers’ safety. There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food  but public health experts have advised consumers to wipe down packaging because the virus could survive on those surfaces for days. Several major meat-processing outfits are offering workers cash incentives to continue showing up for work. At the Tyson plant in Camilla  the company offered its 2 100 workers a $500 bonus if they worked in April  May and June without missing a day. Many of the employees live a 15-minute drive away in Albany  Ga.  which has emerged as one of the epicenters of the coronavirus outbreak. “How many more have to fight for their life  how many more families got to suffer before they realize we are more important than their production ” said Tanisha Isom  36  a deboner on line four at the Camilla plant. She recently learned that she had bronchitis and missed two weeks of work. She has continued to cough  she said  with a low-grade fever and fatigue — and hopes to finally get tested for the coronavirus later this week. “We are crying out for help but no one is listening ” said Ms. Isom  who has worked at Tyson for years and earns $12.95 an hour. “Our work conditions are out of control. We literally work shoulder to shoulder daily ” she said. She said that two people she works closely with are currently fighting for their lives. Gary Mickelson  a spokesman for Tyson Foods  said the company was taking the temperature of workers before they entered and had implemented social-distancing measures. These included dividers between work stations and slower production lines to widen the space between workers. If there is a confirmed case at one site  “we notify anyone who has been in close contact with the person and instruct them to go home and self-quarantine ” he said. He noted that workers who are sick continue to be paid while off the job. He also said that Tyson was coordinating with federal agencies to secure “an adequate supply of protective face coverings for production workers” and other protective coverings. But workers and union leaders said the response by Tyson and other chicken companies  which produce the bulk of the nation’s meat supply  has been inadequate. The Retail  Wholesale and Department Store Union  which represents thousands of poultry processing workers in the South  said that it had been “imploring” producers to take steps to protect workers’ safety while securing the nation’s food supply chain. “Day after day we hear reports of our members contracting the Covid-19 virus and even succumbing to it ” said Stuart Appelbaum  the union’s president. “The poultry industry can and must do better to swiftly protect workers.” “Saying you are still scrambling for protective supplies when much of the supply chain has been protecting workers for weeks is a pathetic excuse for companies that make billions in profits annually ” he said. Fatalities among workers have lent urgency to the demands for protection. Cameron Bruett  a spokesman for JBS  confirmed that an older man who had worked for 30 years at its beef plant in Greeley  Colo.  recently died from complications of Covid-19. Operations have been halted at a plant the company operates in Souderton  Pa.  until April 16  after several managers displayed “flulike symptoms ” he said. In at least seven states  workers at Cargill  the nation’s third-largest meat producer  have tested positive for the virus  according to Dan Sullivan  a company spokesman. Mr. Sullivan confirmed that Cargill had closed a plant in Hazleton  Pa.  after several employees tested positive. The federal government has deemed food-industry workers essential  and Cargill has encouraged employees to stay on the job through the pandemic with extra pay and bonus offers. Workers are eligible for up to 80 hours of paid leave for any virus-related absence. But some employees say they  like Ms. Grant in Georgia  feel pressure to come to work  and others say they cannot afford to remain at home past any paid sick leave. Jose Aguilar  a representative of the union in Alabama  said many immigrant workers might not be eligible for unemployment benefits or payments from the federal stimulus package. “For the immigrant population  it’s really sad because right now  there are a lot of people who don’t have a choice ” he said. “Almost everybody is going to work because they need money.” A woman who has worked for 20 years at Pilgrim’s Pride in Guntersville  Ala.  said that the virus was spreading in the meat packing area  where employees work side by side and social distancing is nearly impossible. Recently  the company took measures to bolster safety  she said. “There are people cleaning the plant; they are checking our temperatures every time we come in the morning; they’re doing all that. They’re starting to give us masks ” said the woman  who asked not to be named for fear of retribution from her employer. “But of course we’re worried because the truth is we don’t know if more people are going to get sick ” she said. Pilgrim’s Pride did not respond to a request for comment. The company’s Facebook page said that workers who show symptoms were being told to stay home. On Facebook  several employees of the Tyson plant in Camilla questioned why those who had been working alongside people who tested positive had not been told to stay away. Others expressed frustration that the facility remained open at all. Shynekia Emanuel  who works nights on the deboning line in Camilla  said that his shift supervisors — the same people who had been checking workers’ temperatures — had tested positive for the virus. A company spokesman said Tyson would not discuss specific employees. Mr. Emanuel  who said that he was particularly vulnerable to the virus because he has Crohn’s disease  will not report to work again until the pandemic has passed. “Enough is enough ” he said. “Nobody wants to risk their lives over some chicken. Sorry. My life and my son’s life is way more important.” Before checking herself into a hospital  Ms. Grant had told her children that several co-workers on her line had been absent. “If they had taken proper precautions  they would have prevented people from getting it ” her son said. “This just isn’t right. It’s about saving multiple lives.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/energy-environment/opec-saudiarabia-russia-oil-coronavirus.html, business energy-environment, OPEC and Russia Agree to Cut Oil Production, The reductions for May and June were smaller than some investors and analysts had expected  and oil prices gave up earlier gains., Supported by The reductions for May and June were smaller than some investors and analysts had expected  and oil prices gave up earlier gains. By Stanley Reed The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  Russia and other countries reached a tentative agreement on Thursday to temporarily cut production. OPEC and the other oil-producing countries agreed to cut 10 million barrels a day — about 23 percent of their production levels — in May and June  they said in a statement on Friday. Possible further trims could come from a meeting of the Group of 20 nations on Friday. Negotiations hit a snag late Thursday over Mexico’s reluctance to cut its share of oil  reportedly 400 000 barrels a day  leaving the deal in limbo. In the statement  the group said the deal was conditional on Mexico’s consent. Even before that happened  oil prices fell because analysts and traders had hoped for a bigger reduction to prevent the buildup of a glut of oil. On Thursday afternoon  the West Texas Intermediate crude future contract  the American benchmark  was down more than 7 percent to $23.28 a barrel. Amrita Sen  chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects  a research firm  said markets would not be impressed by the deal. “In a nutshell  the demand declines are going to be greater than the production declines ” said Ms. Sen. She estimated that demand would be down 25 million barrels a day  or about one-quarter of normal consumption  in April. In addition  the new cuts won’t begin until May  allowing oil supplies to increase. There are also doubts about whether some of the countries party to the cuts  like Iraq  which often produces whatever it can  will really observe them. Ms. Sen said that OPEC and its collaborators were largely doing what they would be forced to do anyway. “With the sharp decline in demand ” global producers will be forced shut down some production “because we will run out of storage space  “ she said. “OPEC-plus is simply codifying what they would have had to cut anyway.” Still  the meeting appears to be at least a start at tackling the most serious problem the oil industry and OPEC countries have encountered in decades. The decision to cut might go some way toward assuaging growing tensions between members of the cartel and the United States. The meeting was called by Saudi Arabia  OPEC’s de facto leader  after President Trump spoke to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  the kingdom’s main policymaker. Mr. Trump said Thursday afternoon that he thought the oil cartel would soon reach a deal  noting that he had just spoken to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. He said it was in the interest of all oil-producing countries  including the United States  to rein in production. “The numbers are so low that there will be layoffs all over the world ” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference  in an apparent reference to oil prices. “There will be certainly layoffs in this country  and we don’t want that to happen.” The Saudis have been engaged in a price war with Russia after Moscow refused to go along with a Saudi proposal in early March to trim output to address a sharp drop in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. The spat threatens to swamp oil markets  including those in the United States  with excessive supplies of crude. OPEC’s secretary general  Mohammad Barkindo  acknowledged in his introductory remarks that the glut of oil had put his organization in a weak position. The Saudis  for instance  have loaded huge volumes of crude onto tankers but are said to be having trouble finding buyers for all the oil. “Our industry is hemorrhaging; no one has been able to stem the bleeding ” he said  according to text of his remarks posted on the OPEC website. “It is imperative we take urgent action.” Some producers in the United States also face difficulty selling and storing oil. Analysts from Wood Mackenzie  a research firm  said during a webinar on Thursday that storage tanks at Cushing  Okla.  probably the most important such location in the United States  were filling at record speeds  putting pressure on prices. With the industry in the United States threatened with job losses and bankruptcies  the Trump administration has been pushing the Saudis and Russians to cut. In an interview Thursday on CNBC  the energy secretary  Dan Brouillette  said that OPEC and its allies “can easily get to 10 million  perhaps even higher  and certainly higher if you include the other nations that produce oil  nations like Canada  Brazil  others.” The U.S. oil industry and the Trump administration have so far brushed off the idea of engaging in coordinated cuts with OPEC and Russia  but American producers are already contributing to production trims. Mr. Brouilette said that the steep fall in demand because of the pandemic would lead to a reduction of production in the United States of two million barrels a day by the end of the year. With storage space “running out  at some point everyone is going to cut production ” he said.

Backs Half-Trillion Euro Stimulus  but Balks at Pooling Debt, While E.U. finance ministers approved a plan to spend 540 billion euros to lift their economies  they couldn’t agree to take the unprecedented step of issuing joint bonds., Supported by While E.U. finance ministers approved a plan to spend 540 billion euros to lift their economies  they couldn’t agree to take the unprecedented step of issuing joint bonds. By Matina Stevis-Gridneff BRUSSELS — European Union finance ministers agreed Thursday night to a plan calling for more than half a trillion euros worth of new measures to buttress their economies against the onslaught of the coronavirus  but dealt a blow to their worst-hit members  Italy and Spain  by sidestepping their pleas for the bloc to issue joint debt. Even in the face of an unprecedented economic crisis caused by a virus that has killed more than 50 000 bloc citizens and infected over a half million  wealthier northern European countries were reluctant to subsidize cheap debt for the badly hit south. And while Germany  the Netherlands and others showed greater generosity than they had in previous crises  the details of the measures announced showed they had gone to great lengths to limit and control the way the funding is used. The programs the finance ministers agreed to recommend to their countries’ leaders for final approval included a €100 billion loan plan for unemployment benefits  €200 billion in loans for smaller businesses  and access to €240 billion in loans for euro-area countries to draw on from the eurozone bailout fund. One euro is equal to about $1.09. But the ministers were not able to reach an agreement on issuing joint bonds  known as “corona-bonds ” despite pleas from the leaders of Italy and Spain  which are bearing the brunt of the crisis  after staunch resistance from Germany  the Netherlands and others. And  in a victory for the Netherlands which was lobbying to restrict how the bailout funds can be used  the ministers decided they should be limited to health-related programs. Throughout its history  the European Union has refused to issue joint bonds  but the size and scope of the current crisis had led some analysts to think the bloc might be willing to back the idea this time  which would have represented a major step in bringing it closer to becoming a United States of Europe. Pooling debt was foundational to the creation of the United States  and it would be considered a momentous step in the bloc’s governance structures moving toward federalism. But the need for unanimous backing of major measures — always a brake on swift and bold decisions by the European Union in times of crisis — derailed the bond idea and meant that negotiations for the shape of the economic package were fraught. It took a second meeting to build consensus  after an attempt on Tuesday ended in acrimony. The finance ministers were well aware of the dramatic toll the virus was taking on all the bloc’s economies and that a failure to produce an agreement would be disastrous for the confidence of both the bloc’s citizens and for financial markets. As the United States moved to announce stimulus measures  there was a growing sense that Europe was once again doing too little too slowly. “The most important thing for the finance ministers was to sign off on a deal and a €540 billion tagline ” said Mujtaba Rahman  the head of Europe practice at Eurasia Group  a consultancy. “But despite everyone patting themselves on the back  there are lots of substantive gaps in the deal that will only become apparent later down the line ” he added. At stake is the recovery of the world’s richest bloc of nations  including the eurozone’s 19 members whose currency is one of the most important globally. A failure by the European Union to help its most affected members would hurt not just its economies  but also affect regional politics and societal attitudes  and cause the bloc to lose clout on the world stage. While the half-trillion euro figure  together with each individual country’s national stimulus programs  is a sizable sum  it is still hard to assess whether it will be nearly enough to help European economies withstand the fallout from the health crisis and achieve any sort of growth as economic activity is gradually resuscitated. The bloc’s wealthier countries may have thwarted the joint bonds  but  inevitably  rescue packages for the worst-hit economies will involve subsidies from the richer north to the poorer south  a recurrent  toxic theme in the bloc’s history. While all countries agreed on Thursday that there should be “solidarity” with the worst-hit countries  and that the European economies are so deeply integrated that rescue packages are helpful to all  the shape of that solidarity proved deeply contentious. For Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy  the deal Thursday will be a tough sell: He has passionately advocated joint debt issuance and demanded easier access to the eurozone bailout fund to support his country’s recovery. He got neither. The joint bonds would raise borrowing costs for the wealthier  more frugal northern countries  whose leaders worry such a move could fuel anti-E.U. populist forces within their borders. They argue that  by treaty  every member nation of the European Union is responsible for its own finances. But anti-European sentiment is also on the rise in Italy and Spain  the bloc’s third- and fourth-largest countries and economies  and the two E.U. nations hit hardest by the virus. Outrage and despair over thousands of deaths have fueled a feeling that Europe is not helping them in their hours of need. The political infighting among the bloc’s leaders and ministers  roughly tracking the battle lines of previous crises that cast northern members against southern ones  is threatening to spawn another wave of euroskepticism and populism. The European Union  already battered over the past decade or so by a major financial crisis  the migration crisis and Brexit  can ill afford failing its members and letting questions over its usefulness spread deeper. The recession that the eurozone will experience because of the coronavirus is set to be brutal: Economists predict the bloc’s output is likely to shrink this year by around 10 percent. By contrast  the recession that followed the last financial crisis was  at its worst year in 2009  4.5 percent in the eurozone. This week brought home just how bad things are getting in some of the region’s most important economies. New data released Wednesday showed that the French economy  the region’s second-largest  shrunk by 6 percent between January and April compared with the last quarter of 2019  the worst performance in half a century  and is now formally in a recession. And in Germany  the Continent’s leading economy  five major institutes predicted the second quarter of this year would bring a 10 percent recession. For Italy and Spain  things could be worse still  with UniCredit predicting a 15 percent recession in each. Paolo Gentiloni  the European commissioner for the economy and a former Italian prime minister who is an advocate for a special coronavirus fund and joint corona-bonds  said that Thursday’s measures were not the final word in Europe’s collective economic response. The fund was mentioned vaguely near the bottom of the ministers’ conclusions as a “recovery fund” to be discussed further by European Union leaders next week. “This is not the end of the road. Thousands of European citizens are still fighting for their lives ” Mr. Gentiloni said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

The Cost: $1 Billion., , A neighborhood of Denham Springs  La.  which suffered heavy flooding in 2016.Credit...Bryan Tarnowski for The New York Times Supported by By Christopher Flavelle and John Schwartz WASHINGTON — It’s a simple rule  designed to protect both homeowners and taxpayers: If you want publicly subsidized flood insurance  you can’t build a home that’s likely to flood. But local governments around the country  which are responsible for enforcing the rule  have flouted the requirements  accounting for as many as a quarter-million insurance policies in violation  according to data provided to The New York Times by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  which runs the flood insurance program. Those structures accounted for more than $1 billion in flood claims during the past decade  the data show. That toll is likely to increase as climate change makes flooding more frequent and intense. Local governments are responsible for enforcing the requirements  but almost none have been penalized for failing to do so. “There’s no negative consequences for violating the rules ” said Rob Moore  a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Rachel Sears  director of FEMA’s floodplain management division  said her office’s strategy was to avoid “immediately pursuing” penalties  and to instead encourage towns and cities to do better. “We work with the communities and property owners to directly remedy the specific violations ” she said. The National Flood Insurance Program covers homeowners in flood-prone towns and cities  often at rates below what private insurers charge  if they offer it at all. In return  FEMA requires local officials to ensure that the ground floor of every new or repaired building is at least as high as the expected peak of a major flood. Coastal states like Florida have the most buildings that don’t meet FEMA’s elevation requirements. But some inland communities have a greater share of buildings that don’t meet those requirements.

The second map shows the percentage of buildings with flood insurance that don’t meet FEMA’s requirements (only counties that have at least 50 structures with flood insurance are included). Source: Data provided by FEMA  analyzed by Naomi Kalman at the University of California  Davis By The New York Times Yet as many as 112 480 structures nationwide fail that test despite being built after the rules took effect  typically decades ago  according to FEMA data analyzed for The Times by Naomi Kalman  a geographic information specialist at the University of California  Davis  and her colleagues. Those structures account for 249 049 flood insurance policies  each representing a separate household or business. (Some buildings  like condominiums  have several units.) More than 2 000 counties nationwide have buildings on the list. The greatest numbers are in Ocean County  N.J.; Pinellas County and Monroe County  both in Florida; Charleston County  S.C.; and Galveston County  Texas. Each has more than 3 000 structures with ground floors that are too low  despite being built after the rules took effect. Another 18 counties have at least 1 000 structures that are listed as being in violation of the rule. Taken together  the owners filed 29 639 flood insurance claims between 2009 and 2018. Those claims led to federal payouts of more than $1 billion  an average of $34 940 per claim. It’s not just a coastal problem. Many counties with a high share of properties are well inland  a reminder that flooding is a nationwide threat. FEMA said some of the properties on its list were probably incorrectly categorized  though it doesn’t know which ones or how many. For example  local building inspectors might have recorded a ground floor as lower than it actually is. Or a home might have been outside the flood zone when first built  but the zone later expanded. “Not all minus-rated policies represent a failure to comply with local floodplain ordinances ” Ms. Sears said  using FEMA’s term for properties that are too low. The only way FEMA can verify which places are breaking its rules  and why  is to conduct a local audit. Of the more than 22 000 communities that participate in the insurance program  FEMA audited just 610 last year  or fewer than 3 percent  according to the agency. That’s down from about 1 500 a year in the early 1990s. “Every federal program has to use the resources available to them ” Ms. Sears said. “We have a set budget.” Roy Wright  who ran the insurance program until 2018  offered another explanation: FEMA is hesitant to enforce its own rules because its only enforcement tools are so severe. In short  punishment can make the homes all but unsellable. The first punishment is to put a city or town on probation  a step that entails a $50 annual surcharge on insurance policies. But the next step is the big one: suspension. That amounts to expulsion from the program — preventing homeowners or businesses from getting federal flood insurance. Without flood insurance  a homeowner in a floodplain can’t obtain a federally backed mortgage  which is what can make a property hard to sell. Throwing a community off the program also means people would lose a valuable tool for rebuilding after a flood. And that would make the other part of FEMA’s job  helping communities recover from disasters  even harder. “People aren’t in a hurry to suspend an entire community  and make flood insurance unavailable to all of them  if only 1 percent of them are bad actors ” said Mr. Wright  who now runs the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety  an industry-funded research group. Even if FEMA did want to jettison a community for breaking the rules  it would prompt hard questions from its representatives in Congress  he added. But letting communities off the hook for breaking the rules sends a signal to other officials around the country that they can follow suit  said Chad Berginnis  head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. Other towns might decide  “FEMA didn’t do anything” when other cities didn’t enforce the rules  Mr. Berginnis said. In the five decades since the program was started  only 77 communities had been put on probation as of last November  according to FEMA. Only 12 have been suspended for failing to enforce the rules. Ms. Sears said communities that fail to enforce the minimum-elevation rules are already penalized  because homeowners in those structures have to pay higher insurance premiums. “These premiums can be quite high ” she said. “The individual policyholder  not the taxpayer or the NFIP  pays for this additional risk.” And throwing communities off the program won’t reduce that risk  Ms. Sears said. “The goal is not to remove communities ” Ms. Sears said. “Our goal is to make sure that they’re enforcing the requirements.” In interviews  officials from places nationwide that have run afoul of the requirements defended themselves  describing the myriad ways a community can end up on the wrong side of FEMA’s rules. In Kirkland  Ill.  Ryan Block  the village president  said a resident in the 1990s who owned marshland filled it in to build houses  ignoring warnings from FEMA and state officials. “They continued to build homes until the subdivision was basically done ” Mr. Block said. FEMA spent more than 20 years warning Kirkland to fix the problem  Mr. Block said  before putting the village on probation in 2016. He said he doesn’t know why the agency waited so long to act  but once it did  local officials began making the fixes that FEMA requested  spending $600 000 to restore the wetlands. Other places have faced no consequences. In many cases  local officials reported having never even been told by FEMA that they were doing something wrong. In Chesapeake  Va.  which  according to FEMA’s data  has 650 structures built below the flood level  permit director Jay Tate said he didn’t know which homes were in violation of the rules. He said the city joined the program in the late 1970s  but didn’t start enforcing the rules for perhaps a decade or more. “It probably wasn’t until about 1990 that we had a robust review of building plans to make sure it was in accordance with that ” Mr. Tate said. In nearby Poquoson  Va.  which FEMA shows as having 469 homes that fail to meet its provisions  about 10 percent of all homes in the city  floodplain manager Ken Somerset said the agency hadn’t alerted him to the issue. “I would be interested to see that list ” Mr. Somerset said. In Pinellas County  Fla.  which has almost 4 000 structures that are too low  floodplain manager Lisa Foster said there were different possible explanations  including inaccurate elevation measurements. She said the county would have no way of knowing how many structures were built in violation of the rules “without doing a detailed analysis of the data for each ” and said she wasn’t aware of FEMA contacting the county about the problem. “Pinellas County has a very active floodplain management program ” Ms. Foster said in a statement. In the Florida Keys  Christine Hurley  assistant administrator for Monroe County  likewise said she had no knowledge of FEMA warning officials about the county’s more than 3 000 structures that are too low. One of the counties with the greatest number of affected properties in the country is Cape May  N. J.  where FEMA data says 3 308 structures are too low. When asked about the figures  Martin Pagliughi  the county’s emergency management director  said he had never heard the term “minus-rated” that FEMA uses to describe structures that are too low. When told what it meant  he said FEMA must be wrong. “I don’t believe the numbers ” Mr. Pagliughi said. “That’s way out of whack.” FEMA’s reluctance to impose penalties has become apparent most recently in Livingston Parish  a part of Louisiana just east of Baton Rouge that was hit hard by flooding in 2016. Thousands of homes were severely damaged. Under the rules of the insurance program  homes that are badly damaged must be rebuilt according to the latest floodplain rules  including elevating the ground floor to at least the height of an expected flood. But more than 3 000 homes in Livingston Parish were built back to their too-low original height  according to Ms. Sears. It’s not clear if local building inspectors gave people permission to break those rules  or simply didn’t know the rules were being broken  Ms. Sears said. Either way  FEMA is now pushing officials for a plan to get each of those homes elevated. That hasn’t happened. The chief penalty so far has been the $50 annual surcharge. “We’re continuing to assess their status ” Ms. Sears said  when asked why the parish was still in the program. “It’s in the interest of everyone to have communities that are enforcing strong floodplain management requirements — and that we have insured survivors.” Layton Ricks  the president of Livingston Parish  said he understood FEMA’s concerns. “I’m not stupid ” he said. And he also appreciates the work local FEMA representatives have done to help people after the floods  which left more than 80 percent of the parish under water. “My goal was to get people back in their homes ” he said. “Did we violate some FEMA rules and regulations? I guess maybe we did ” Mr. Ricks added. “I also know what it’s like to look at that 70-  75-  80-year-old couple trying to get back in their homes  and they don’t give a flip about FEMA regulations.” For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/wisconsin-election-absentee-coronavirus.html, us politics, Inside Wisconsin’s Election Mess: Thousands of Missing or Nullified Ballots, As Wisconsin scrambled to expand voting by mail for its election on Tuesday  many absentee voters said their ballots went undelivered., Supported by As Wisconsin scrambled to expand voting by mail for its election on Tuesday  many absentee voters said their ballots went undelivered. By Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul Three tubs of absentee ballots that never reached voters were discovered in a postal center outside Milwaukee. At least 9 000 absentee ballots requested by voters were never sent  and others recorded as sent were never received. Even when voters did return their completed ballots in the mail  thousands were postmarked too late to count — or not at all. Cracks in Wisconsin’s vote-by-mail operation are now emerging after the state’s scramble to expand that effort on the fly for voters who feared going to the polls in Tuesday’s elections. The takeaways — that the election network and the Postal Service were pushed to the brink of their capabilities  and that mistakes were clearly made — are instructive for other states if they choose to broaden vote-by-mail methods without sufficient time  money and planning. More than 860 000 completed absentee ballots had been returned by Tuesday  already a record for Wisconsin spring elections. But for thousands of other voters  who never received their ballots  there was only one recourse: putting their health at risk and defying a stay-at-home order to vote in person during the coronavirus pandemic. Many chose not to show up. Federal health officials have suggested that expanding voting by mail could help reduce crowds at polling places and therefore make elections safer amid the outbreak. The issues that have arisen in Wisconsin offer a warning for other states of the potential pitfalls of a rapid  last-minute expansion of absentee balloting  particularly one marred by a flurry of court challenges and 11th-hour rulings that created confusion and chaos. The mix of missing and mismarked ballots suggests that thousands of Wisconsin voters were effectively disenfranchised  an issue that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned of in her dissent to a Supreme Court decision on Monday that blocked extended absentee balloting in the state. Tens of thousands of people who did not receive their ballots in time  Justice Ginsburg wrote  “will be left quite literally without a vote.” But many Republicans  and even some Democrats  have continued to cast concerns on the security and veracity of vote-by-mail systems  especially ones expanded so rapidly. “It’s a harder system to administer  and obviously it’s a harder system to police writ large ” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  Democrat of New York  said in a radio interview on Thursday  when asked about the downsides to expanding voting by mail. “People showing up  people actually showing ID  is still the easiest system to assure total integrity.” In Wisconsin  the missing votes could also portend a long legal battle over the results; one race on Tuesday’s ballot was a hotly contested State Supreme Court seat that  in a normal election  was expected to be extremely close. The margin in the state’s 2019 Supreme Court race was about 6 000 votes. “This has all the makings of a Florida 2000 if we have a close race ” said Gordon Hintz  the Democratic minority leader in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Mr. Hintz  who lives in Oshkosh  was one of the voters who never received his absentee ballot — even though the state’s website said it had been mailed to him. He chose not to vote in person. Others in Mr. Hintz’s district may have encountered the same problem. On Tuesday  calls began flooding the office of Dan Feyen  the state senator whose district includes Oshkosh  from voters saying they never received their ballots  even though they were told their ballots had been sent out. Nearly every one of those voters had requested their ballots on one of three dates: March 18  March 22 and March 23  more than two weeks before the election. Mr. Feyen  a Republican  filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission  asking it to investigate. He also wants those voters to be given a chance to fill out and return ballots. On Wednesday  the commission received a phone call from a postal worker in Milwaukee who said three bins of absentee ballots had been located that had never reached their destinations  mostly in Oshkosh and nearby Appleton. The number of ballots in the bins was not clear. A spokeswoman for the Postal Service  Martha Johnson  said Thursday that officials were “aware of potential issues with absentee ballots in Wisconsin and are currently conducting an investigation into the claims.” Meagan Wolfe  the elections commission’s administrator  said she did not think the U.S. Supreme Court decision left any room for ballots to be counted if they were not postmarked by Tuesday’s deadline. “There really isn’t any additional things for this election that a voter could do if their ballot didn’t make it by the deadline ” she said in a news conference on Wednesday. Many of the complaints from voters came from the Oshkosh and Appleton areas  but voters from all over the state said they had not received the absentee ballots they requested. Dianne Ostrowski of Waukesha  about 20 miles west of Milwaukee  said she had filed an online request for an absentee ballot but never received one. “I’m talking via Facebook with my family in Madison. Same thing. They never got their ballot either ” said Ms. Ostrowski  who is retired from the financial services industry. Madison  the capital  is more than an hour west of Waukesha. Tamera Goodwin and her husband  who live in Madison  also said they hadn’t received ballots. “I was looking all over the place  I was looking on the news  Facebook  my state assemblyman’s page  talking to neighbors at a distance  but everyone was confused ” Ms. Goodwin said. “None of us has gotten our ballots and none of us had clarity of where to go.” Lacking other options  Ms. Goodwin and her husband went to vote in person on Tuesday. In Racine  about 40 minutes south of Milwaukee  Dawn and Jeff Loken  also retired  complained that they did not receive their ballots. The two Democrats finally trudged to the polls Tuesday night  not to be deterred by what Mr. Loken  who describes himself as a “die-hard Democrat” viewed as an intentional effort by Republicans to suppress his vote. (State Republican lawmakers rebuffed the Democratic governor’s request to postpone the election.) Some absentee voters who received their ballots and mailed them back in time are running into a separate issue: postmarking. After much legal wrangling over this year’s absentee ballot deadlines  the Supreme Court’s decision held that ballots must be postmarked by Election Day to count. But in at least one city  Madison  a number of ballots received by the clerk were never even postmarked to begin with. “We are still receiving mail now from the post office  and about half of it is postmarked ” said Maribeth Witzel-Behl  the city clerk. “It’s probably by now a couple thousand that we’ve received from the post office with no postmark.” She said her office is dating the ballots with its own stamp as soon as they arrive  and is working with the city attorney to determine what to do with them. Even when postmarks are applied  they can prove problematic  particularly for some rural voters. Michelle Schwenneker  who lives in rural Jackson County  said that the mail truck in her town comes once a day  at 7:30 a.m.  so if she put her ballot in the mailbox on Election Day it wouldn’t be postmarked in time. “For me  basically  mailing your ballot and having it postmarked are basically two different things ” said Ms. Schwenneker. With ballots still trickling in and results yet to be released  there has been no major legal challenge to Tuesday’s election. But activist groups and election lawyers in Wisconsin are still reviewing their options and monitoring reports of missing ballots. Even in states that already vote entirely by mail  lost ballots can plague a system. In Colorado  Secretary of State Jena Griswold excoriated the Postal Service last November after 828 ballots arrived in Denver-area mailboxes on the afternoon of a tight mayoral race in suburban Aurora — too late for many people to vote. But perhaps nothing presented as great a challenge for Wisconsin as the vast expansion of the absentee system in such a short period of time. More than 1.2 million ballots were requested this year; only about 250 000 were issued in Wisconsin’s 2016 spring election. Kim Wyman  the secretary of state in Washington  a mail-voting state  said it is important for elections officials to work with local postal systems to make sure they can handle the sudden increase in volume. “These states are going from 0 to 100 ” she said.

A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/us/politics/09wisconsin/merlin_171407025_a354ea0c-f063-46bb-b20c-70e3bbd0e33c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-nick-corasaniti/author-nick-corasaniti-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/reader-center/author-stephanie-saul/author-stephanie-saul-thumbLarge.png

By Ben Hubbard BEIRUT  Lebanon — The coronavirus pandemic may help end one of the world’s nastiest wars. That hope appeared this week when the main combatants in Yemen  the poorest Arab country  laid out their visions of the path toward peace. Saudi Arabia on Wednesday announced a unilateral cease-fire to allow for talks and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Almost simultaneously  the Houthi rebels who control the Yemeni capital unveiled their own eight-page peace plan. The United Nations  which has been struggling for years to quell Yemen’s violence  hopes to convene talks between them as early as next week. It all sounds like progress  but analysts and diplomats who track Yemen said the distance between the warring sides’ positions and the barriers that need to be cleared are so great that the new moves were — at best — opening gambits. The war has generated incalculable human suffering since the Saudi-led bombing and blockading of Yemen began in 2015. Tens of thousands of people have died  towns and cities have been destroyed  poverty has spread and diseases like cholera have proved hard to beat because the country’s medical system has been dismantled and many people lack clean water. That reality would leave Yemen’s 30 million people dangerously vulnerable should the coronavirus take hold  and the country reported its first case on Friday. The infected man  a 60-year-old heavy smoker  is a laborer at the port in the town of Al-Shihir in Hadramout Province  where he is believed to have caught the virus from foreign sailors. He is being treated in a hospital  and the authorities have locked down the town and dispatched soldiers to keep residents in their homes. The Saudi cease-fire announcement came five years after the kingdom and a number of its Arab allies launched a military intervention in Yemen to try to push back the Houthis  who are aligned with Iran  Saudi Arabia’s regional rival. The Houthis had stormed the Yemeni capital  Sana  and sent the government into exile. Now  the Saudis have many reasons to look for a way out  analysts said. The war’s cost has been tremendous  and at a time when the kingdom’s de facto ruler  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  wants to push through expensive efforts to diversify the Saudi economy. More recently  the worldwide drop in demand for oil  because of coronavirus lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia  has exacerbated the fiscal strains  reducing the price of oil to less than half of what the kingdom needs to balance its budget. Saudi Arabia has long faced international censure for contributing to Yemen’s humanitarian collapse  criticism that would probably intensify if many Yemenis started dying of Covid-19. But the kingdom may be stuck with an enemy who prefers to keep fighting. Within hours of the cease-fire’s start time of noon Thursday  there were reports of breaches. The Saudis had told the Houthis in advance that the cease-fire announcement was coming  according to a diplomat with knowledge of the exchange. But Houthi leaders have yet to issue an official response to the initiative. In a telephone call  Muhammad al-Bukhaiti  a senior Houthi leader  dismissed the Saudi announcement as “more of a continuation of the war than a cease-fire.” “Saudi Arabia is mobilizing its air  navy and armed forces to continue blockading Yemen  which has a far greater impact than the continuation of air bombing ” he said. Another senior Houthi official  Mohammed Ali al-Houthi  released the group’s own peace proposal. It included  among other things  the end of the Saudi-led blockade  the reopening of Yemeni airports  long-term Saudi financial commitments to Yemen’s reconstruction and direct talks between the Saudis and the Houthis about Yemen’s political future — with no direct mention of the Yemeni government. Those demands indicated that after standing in the face of the Arab world’s richest country and keeping the Yemeni capital for five years  the Houthis were in no mood to offer concessions  analysts said. “The Saudis are trying to wiggle out of the conflict  and the Houthis are grabbing them by the neck ” said Abdulghani Al-Iryani  senior researcher at the Sana Center for Strategic Studies. The Houthi position is strengthened by military gains in recent months against the kingdom’s Yemeni allies in key provinces in central Yemen. “The only thing they are good at is fighting ” Mr. Al-Iryani said of the Houthis  “and they are not going to abandon this comfortable terrain without a comprehensive agreement.” Other analysts raised other issues that could affect the success of the Saudi cease-fire. For one  who else will honor it remains unknown. “It is unilateral  so it is not clear what the Houthis reaction is  nor how much buy-in there is from the Yemenis fighting the Houthis on the ground ” said April Longley Alley  deputy program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group. “Are other Yemenis on board with this?” A number of leaders in Yemen’s internationally recognized government said on Thursday that they supported the cease-fire  and Yemen’s president  Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi  was reported to have called on loyalist troops to stop fighting. But Mr. Hadi and many of his ministers are in exile in Saudi Arabia and have little control over the fighters on the ground at home. If the warring parties do decide to engage in talks  which would be conducted via phone and computer linkups  the United Nations has laid the diplomatic groundwork through months of discussions with both sides. But whether they would participate is far from clear. “Implementing a cease-fire is no small matter  and the first test of this is going to be whether the parties show up for this virtual meeting ” Ms. Alley said. Even if they do  the cease-fire is unlikely to endure unless it is tied to a larger process aimed at addressing the many issues that have kept Yemenis fighting. “Without a political process undergirding a cease-fire  without a way out and without very tangible economic and humanitarian confidence-building measures  the cease-fire cannot be durable ” Ms. Alley said. Saeed Al-Batati contributed reporting from Al Mukalla  Yemen  and Shuaib Almosawa from Sana.

No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/07/world/09yemen/merlin_145723368_e1545c1d-aa5c-41d4-a11a-273f5e63a843-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/multimedia/author-ben-hubbard/author-ben-hubbard-thumbLarge.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/arts/mort-drucker-dead.html, arts, Mort Drucker  Master of the Mad Caricature  Is Dead at 91, His illustrations of celebrities for Mad magazine’s movie and television satires inspired countless cartoonists. Actors  politicians and others knew they had made it when he drew them., Supported by His illustrations of celebrities for Mad magazine’s movie and television satires inspired countless cartoonists. Actors  politicians and others knew they had made it when he drew them. By J. Hoberman Mort Drucker  a longtime contributor to Mad magazine known for his caricatures of actors  politicians and other celebrities  died on Thursday at his home in Woodbury  N.Y. He was 91. His death was confirmed by his daughter Laurie Bachner. Mr. Drucker  who specialized in illustrating Mad’s movie and television satires  inspired several generations of cartoonists. “To me  he’s the guy ” the caricaturist Drew Friedman said. “I used to imitate his work in Mad when I was a kid. I wanted to be Mort Drucker; I even loved his name.” Mr. Drucker’s facility was best expressed in multi-caricature crowd scenes. His parody of the 1986 Woody Allen film  “Hannah and Her Sisters ” opened with a panel depicting a Thanksgiving dinner that  in addition to most of the movie’s ensemble cast  included caricatures of Mr. Allen’s former wife  Louise Lasser; the film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel; Mayor Ed Koch of New York; and Mad’s mascot  Alfred E. Neuman. His drawing for a 1970 Time magazine cover  “Battle for the Senate ” now in the National Portrait Gallery  featured a pileup of 15 individually characterized political figures  including President Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. Mad’s takeoff on the MGM retrospective feature “That’s Entertainment ” published in 1975  required Mr. Drucker to caricature more than two dozen stars. “I think I’ve drawn almost everyone in Hollywood ” he told The New York Times in 2000. Some of Mr. Drucker’s most inventive works were double satires. The 1963 Mad piece “East Side Story ” written by Frank Jacobs  is a parody of “West Side Story” as played out by prominent international figures. Nikita Khrushchev  Fidel Castro and Charles de Gaulle are among the many world leaders drawn cavorting against photographed backdrops of New York City streets. “It’s a Blunderful Life ” written by Stan Hart and published in 1996  updated “It’s a Wonderful Life” to star Richard Nixon as Bill Clinton’s guardian angel. A self-taught freelance cartoonist who had worked on war  western  science fiction and romance comic books as well as personality-driven titles like The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and The Adventures of Bob Hope  Mr. Drucker came to Mad in late 1956  soon after Al Feldstein succeeded Harvey Kurtzman  the magazine’s founder  as editor. Mad had run only occasional TV and movie satires  but Mr. Drucker’s arrival “changed everything ” the pop-culture critic Grady Hendrix wrote in a 2013 Film Comment appreciation of Mad’s movie parodies. “No one saw Drucker’s talent ” Mr. Hendrix wrote  until he illustrated “The Night That Perry Masonmint Lost a Case ” a takeoff on the television courtroom drama “Perry Mason ” in 1959. It was then  Mr. Hendrix maintained  that “the basic movie parody format for the next 44 years was born.” From the early 1960s on  nearly every issue of Mad included a movie parody  and before Mr. Drucker retired he had illustrated 238  more than half of them. The last one  “The Chronic-Ills of Yawnia: Prince Thespian ” appeared in 2008. Mr. Drucker compared his method to creating a movie storyboard: “I become the ‘camera ’” he once said  “and look for angles  lighting  close-ups  wide angles  long shots — just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can.” Mr. Hendrix called Mr. Drucker “the cartoonist’s equivalent of an actor’s director” and “a master of drawing hands  faces and body language.” Mr. Friedman praised Mr. Drucker’s restraint: “He wasn’t really hung up on exaggerating. He was far more subtle and nuanced — interested in how people stood and so on.” Morris Drucker was born on March 22  1929  in Brooklyn. His father  Edward  was a businessman who repaired jukeboxes and ran a bar  among other things. His mother  Sarah (Spielvogel) Drucker  was a homemaker. He attended Erasmus Hall High School  where he met his future wife  Barbara Hellerman. In addition to his daughter Laurie  he is survived by his wife; another daughter  Melanie Amsterdam; and three grandchildren. Mr. Drucker began his professional career at 18 when  recommended by the cartoonist Will Eisner  a family friend  he got a job assisting on the comic book Debbie Dean  Career Girl. He also worked on a syndicated single-panel strip  “The Mountain Boys ” before finding steady work with National Periodical Publications  now known as DC Comics. He continued to freelance for DC even after joining Mad’s “usual gang of idiots.” Working in a studio at his home in Woodbury  on Long Island  he also drew magazine illustrations  album covers  movie posters and advertisements. Mr. Drucker was modest about his gifts. “When I started working for Mad  they assigned me TV satires and asked me to draw famous people ” he recalled. “So I just did it. It took me a long time to learn the skills I have  and it was time-consuming. With me  everything is trial and error.” Mr. Drucker also illustrated children’s books and contributed to the vogue for adult coloring books  collaborating with the comedy writer Paul Laikin on “The JFK Coloring Book ” which sold hundreds of thousands  if not millions  of copies in 1962. Between 1984 and 1987  he collaborated on the syndicated newspaper strip “Benchley ” which revolved around a fictional assistant to President Ronald Reagan. Reagan  whom Mr. Drucker once caricatured as the Godfather  Moses  Scrooge and a slavering Mr. Hyde in a 1982 Mad story  “Ronald Reagan — Now Starring at the White House ” written by Stan Hart  was evidently a fan of the strip and treated Mr. Drucker and his wife to a private tour of the White House. (There would be a Ronald Reagan coloring book as well.) In 2015  Mr. Drucker was the first winner of the National Society of Cartoonists’ Medal of Honor for lifetime achievement. In 2017  he was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. Mr. Drucker not only satirized popular culture; he also became a part of it. Appearing on “The Tonight Show” in 1985  the actor Michael J. Fox told Johnny Carson that he knew he had made it in show business “when Mort Drucker drew my head.” The director Joe Dante wrote that “there are few thrills in life quite like seeing your own movie parodied in the pages of Mad.” But not everyone was so pleased. According to Mr. Hendrix  Mad’s 1981 parody of “The Empire Strikes Back ” “The Empire Strikes Out ” prompted the Lucasfilm legal department to send a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the issue be recalled. “Mad replied by sending a copy of another letter they had received the previous month — from George Lucas  offering to buy the original artwork for the ‘Empire’ parody and comparing Mort Drucker to Leonardo da Vinci.” Mr. Lucas knew Mr. Drucker’s work well. He had commissioned one of Mr. Drucker’s classic multicharacter pileups as the poster for his first hit  “American Graffiti” — a nostalgic movie set in the same summer “The JFK Coloring Book” was a best seller. And  of course  Mr. Drucker had illustrated Mad’s sendup  “American Confetti.” Julia Carmel contributed reporting.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/coronavirus-health-workers-speak-out.html, business, Nurses and Doctors Speaking Out on Safety Now Risk Their Job, Hospitals have warned  disciplined and even fired staff members who went public with workplace concerns about coronavirus precautions., Supported by Hospitals have warned  disciplined and even fired staff members who went public with workplace concerns about coronavirus precautions. By Noam Scheiber and Brian M. Rosenthal It was the fliers bearing his photo that made Adam Witt suspect something had gone deeply wrong. Last week  Jersey Shore University Medical Center  where he worked as a nurse  posted the fliers at two security stations  declaring that he was persona non grata. “Mr. Witt is not allowed on property at JSUMC ” the writing said  beneath a picture of him looking tired and pained. “If he is seen on property please contact your supervisor immediately.” The troubles had started when Mr. Witt  the local nurses’ union president  learned that a fellow nurse had been disciplined for raising concerns on a private Facebook page about coronavirus exposure at the hospital. Mr. Witt told his manager that he would be taking a day off to defend the nurse at a disciplinary hearing  a task that he and other union officials had carried out numerous times under their contract. The hospital says a supervisor suggested that Mr. Witt skip only part of the day because of the surge in patients. A week later  on March 31  the hospital said he was being suspended because the day he took was unauthorized. The fliers soon followed. “It’s not what they normally do in these cases ” Mr. Witt said in an interview. “You don’t get ‘wanted’ posters.” He was fired after a disciplinary hearing on Monday. His employer cited the absence  but he believes that the firing stemmed from his persistent questioning of the administration during the pandemic  including his own social media posts. As the coronavirus crisis has escalated  workers as varied as grocery cashiers  customer-service representatives and flight attendants have clashed with the employers they accuse of failing to protect and properly value them. Amazon drew attention when it fired a worker who had led a protest over health concerns at a Staten Island warehouse. But perhaps the most curious and persistent management-labor tension has arisen between health care providers like doctors and nurses  who are at the forefront of the virus battle  and the administrators they report to. In New York City  the epicenter of the crisis in the United States  every major private hospital system has sent memos in recent weeks ordering workers not to speak with the media  as have some public hospitals. One system  NYU Langone Medical Center  which has more than 30 000 employees at six inpatient centers  dozens of outpatient facilities and the New York University School of Medicine  sent an email on March 27 warning that staff members speaking to the media without permission “will be subject to disciplinary action  including termination.” The email was reported earlier by Bloomberg. Administrators suggested “appropriate” posts on social media instead. “Please share positive and uplifting messages that support your colleagues and our organization ” they said in another email. Similar lines are being drawn nationwide. A doctor in Washington State was removed from his hospital position after speaking publicly about a shortage of protective equipment and testing; the staffing firm that employs him said he was being reassigned. Nurses in Detroit recently walked off the job to protest critically low staffing after a colleague who had spoken up on the issue was fired. A union representing an Oregon nurse says she was told she would face disciplinary action after being quoted in the media  though the hospital did not follow through. “They’re very protective of their reputation in the community ” said Jhonna Porter  a nurse who was suspended from West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles after raising safety concerns in a private Facebook group and publicly on her own page  including appeals for equipment. “If anything seems like it might make them look bad  they’re going to stomp on it quick.” Ms. Porter was reinstated on Wednesday after media reports about the conflict. In a statement  the hospital said she had created privacy concerns by posting about “specific information  including room numbers of possible Covid patients  to a Facebook group that included former employees.” It said it had determined that the violation of policy was inadvertent and that she had been reinstated with no disciplinary action taken or loss of pay. Philip Martin Rosoff  an emeritus professor at Duke University School of Medicine who headed the hospital ethics committee there  said that hospitals had become more corporate over the decades and that their executives consequently had the same impulses as other executives to “control the narrative.” However  he said  hospital officials have other reasons to be wary of doctors and nurses who take matters into their own hands  such as patient safety. He cited the refusal of some surgeons to treat H.I.V.-positive patients at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Perhaps nowhere is the friction between health workers and management more palpable than in the New York area. Health systems including Northwell Health  NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center have barred workers from speaking to reporters  though not always with the explicit threat of termination. “Do not respond or speak to any reporters  as well as current or former employees  regarding a pending news story ” wrote David A. Feinberg  the chief marketing and communications officer at the Mount Sinai Health System  in an email to all faculty and students on March 26. Mount Sinai has more than 40 000 employees. There has been internal dissent as well. Tasha Smith  a Mount Sinai nurse  said she had been fired after complaining to her boss that she was uncomfortable treating coronavirus patients without proper equipment  and said she had brought a doctor’s note attesting to her anxiety. Mount Sinai said in a statement that Ms. Smith had been fired because “without any notice  she walked off the job.” It also said it always provided its medical staff with the equipment needed “to safely do their job.” Ms. Smith  who had worked at the hospital for three years  said the abrupt firing frightened fellow nurses. “They’re afraid to speak up ” she said. “I was made an example of.” On Friday  several New York City Council members announced plans for legislation to prohibit firing health care workers for speaking publicly about hospital conditions. “They have the guts to speak up to improve the larger issue  and the reward that their employers give them is to be fired or sent gag orders or threats — it’s unconscionable ” said Councilman Brad Lander  a Brooklyn Democrat  who is a primary sponsor. Few health systems appear to have gone to the lengths of Mr. Witt’s employer  Hackensack Meridian Health  a New Jersey-based chain of 17 hospitals and a variety of other facilities that reported $6 billion in revenue in its 2018 annual report. Mr. Witt  who retrained midcareer to become a nurse after seeing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005  said labor relations at the hospital had been strained for several years. But he and two other Jersey Shore nurses said tensions had escalated substantially since the onset of the pandemic  in which New Jersey has been one of the states hardest hit. More than 150 patients with the virus have been taken to the medical center so far. Mr. Witt and his colleagues said they previously had direct access to senior hospital officials  including the chief nursing officer. In recent weeks  however  the administration has stopped responding to direct inquiries  requiring them to communicate through a human resources official  they said. “As they built these walls  we have less ability to bring concerns forward ” Mr. Witt said. “It’s like they decided it was martial law in a crisis.” A hospital spokeswoman said that “as a result of senior leadership’s need to be on the front line during this unprecedented pandemic  we knew unfettered access was not tenable  so we offered this alternative.” The issue of protective equipment has been particularly fraught. Mr. Witt and other nurses said the administration had kept N95 masks — which block most airborne particles — locked in an office  rationing them tightly and making them difficult to obtain in an emergency. “In a time like this  we need honesty ” Mr. Witt said. “‘This is how many N95s we have. We can give you this many for your shift. You all decide what makes sense.’” Instead  he added  “they stopped answering us.” Daniel Varga  the chain’s chief physician executive  said in an interview that the masks had been locked down because they were disappearing from hospitals on a regular basis  which “puts front-line caregivers at risk.” Mr. Witt also took to social media to talk about shortcomings in personal protective equipment  hazard pay and other issues  including one Facebook post that was shared more than 400 times. Mr. Witt said that by the time he was suspended  the hospital appeared to have lost its patience and was “sort of throwing the book at me.” He provided documentation showing that he emailed his manager informing her of the union day  and shared language from the contract that provides for 26 such days per year. He said that he had never been told he couldn’t take the day off and that even if the day had been unexcused  it would not typically merit a suspension or termination. A Hackensack Meridian spokeswoman said that the hospital had the right to deny a request based on patient needs and that in addition to his absence  Mr. Witt “showed abusive behavior” by threatening to text the chief nursing officer hourly in late March after a human resources official did not respond to a query. “For the safety of staff and patients  security had to be alerted to not let him on the premises ” the spokeswoman said  alluding to the flier featuring his picture  which she said had been posted out of public view. Mr. Witt said he had filed an appeal of his termination  which will require another administrative hearing. The case could end up before an arbitrator. In the meantime  he will remain president of the local union  across the bargaining table from management in a coming contract negotiation. “I don’t know if that occurred to them that I’ll be union president  still representing people ” he said. “Now this is all I have to do.” Somini Sengupta  Rod Nordland and Ashley Southall contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/seismographs-lockdown-coronavirus.html, science, Coronavirus Turns Urban Life’s Roar to Whisper on World’s Seismographs, Geoscientists are getting a clearer picture of what’s going on beneath our feet as lockdowns keep many of us at home., Supported by Geoscientists are getting a clearer picture of what’s going on beneath our feet as lockdowns keep many of us at home. By Robin George Andrews Seismometers may be built to detect earthquakes  but their mechanical ears hear so much more: hurricanes thundering hundreds of miles away and meteoroids exploding in the skies on the other side of the planet. Even the everyday hum of humanity — people moving about on cars  trains and planes — has a seismically detectable heartbeat. But coronavirus has upended our lives. Hoping to curtail the pandemic’s spread  nations have closed their borders  cities have been shut down and billions of people have been instructed to stay home. Today  in cities large and small  the thumping pulse of civilization is now barely detectable on many seismograms. “It did make the scale of the shutdowns a bit more real to me ” said Celeste Labedz  a graduate student in geophysics at the California Institute of Technology. In person  you can see only your neighborhood’s dedication to remaining home. With seismometers  Ms. Labedz said  you can see the collective willingness of millions of the world’s urban dwellers to hunker down. As a result  the planet’s natural quavering is being recorded with remarkable clarity. This seismological experiment began with Thomas Lecocq  a seismologist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels. He wanted to see what happened to his city’s anthropogenic hiss after its lockdown began in mid-March. His finding  that it had declined precipitously  was shared on Twitter and via news organizations  prompting seismologists elsewhere to look at their own city’s lack of shakes. Many used Dr. Lecocq’s bespoke coding to eke out the human noise in their seismic data. It quickly became apparent that the roar of urban life had turned into a whisper all over the world  in places as far-flung as California and Croatia. “It’s crazy ” Dr. Lecocq said. London is no longer buzzing. Paula Koelemeijer  a seismologist at Royal Holloway  University of London  said the seismometer in her suburban house was clocking a 20 to 25 percent reduction in average weekly noise  compared with the week before Britain began its lockdown. Another seismometer nearer the city center registered a 30 percent drop. In both areas  the cacophonous rhythm of the morning rush has nearly evaporated. Noise levels on some seismic stations in Los Angeles have dropped to below half of what they normally are  Ms. Labedz said. Weekdays sometimes have a quieter seismic signal than pre-pandemic weekends. Claudio Satriano  a seismologist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics  detected a 38 percent drop in the average daytime noise in his city. The oscillation of commuting workers has faded  and thundering nightlife on the weekends has fizzled. Stephen Hernandez  a seismologist at the Geophysical Institute in Quito  Ecuador  said that a seismic station in the northern part of the city had previously recorded noise declines during times of upheaval  including during perilous social unrest in October 2019. That station is now registering a staggering 60 percent decline in noise  with any peaks during the city’s lockdown barely surpassing the minimum noise levels observed during normal times. The bustle of college students the world over has gone. David Cornwell  a geophysicist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland  has been watching the seismometer in a colleague’s office. Compared with peak noise during a normal day  the noise levels on the university’s King’s College campus have dropped by 60 percent since its students were sent home. The pitter-patter of children has also been quieted. A seismic station in a Nepalese school that Dr. Lecocq has observed normally reverberates with the pandemonium of children running to and from their place of learning. Now  he said  “those noise levels have completely vanished.” The characteristic cultural fingerprints of some cities are notable by their absence on seismograms. For example  the vibrations generated in Barcelona by enormous crowds leaping up and down at Camp Nou — the stadium home to the F.C. Barcelona soccer team — have disappeared. “No more ‘Messiquakes’ for a while ” said Jordi Díaz  a seismologist at the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera in that city  referring to little temblors set off by fans celebrating the goals of the soccer star Lionel Messi. Seismograms also have shown how some cities quieted down even before mandatory lockdowns took effect. New Zealand’s national order was put in place just before midnight on March 25  but people were advised that a lockdown was imminent two days beforehand. Seismographs in Auckland  a city of 1.6 million people  show a clear decline in noise before the first day that the mandate took effect  said Geoff Kilgour  a volcanologist at GNS Science  a geoscientific research organization. On March 22  a 5.4-magnitude earthquake rocked Croatia  the most severe the capital city of Zagreb has experienced in 140 years. Aftershocks have been shaking the city ever since  and people would usually be able to feel only the more potent ones. But temblors typically imperceptible to humans are now being reported by hundreds of residents  said Rémy Bossu  the secretary general of the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center. This uptick in individual seismic sensitivity may be explained by the fact that the city’s residents are being cooped up at home. Scientists  too  are now able to better hear the planet’s natural tectonic soundtrack. With the volume of humanity reduced  “we can detect smaller earthquakes  just like how it’s easier to hear a phone ring in a library than at a rock concert ” Ms. Labedz said. Mr. Hernandez has also been able to hear more rumblings from the active volcano that Quito straddles  something attributed to the reduction of city noise. And on Dr. Koelemeijer’s household seismometer  earthquakes of middling magnitudes emanating from distant continents  no longer buried by the rumble of rush hour traffic  are now showing up in the day. A cleaner and more frequent detection of Earth’s seismic activity grants seismologists a less filtered look into the planet’s interior. Although many seismometers are purposefully located far from cities  plenty of urban areas — especially those in seismically hyperactive parts of the planet — are peppered with seismometers. In this time of human quiescence  the creaking of some potentially dangerous faults may be detected better than ever. Academic benefits aside  many scientists are heartened to see that the lockdowns’ seismic signatures are visible in dozens of populous cities across the world. Noise levels in many of them show no sign of increasing  and in some places  like London  they have dropped over time. That “indicates more and more people are taking it seriously and thus doing their best to flatten the curve ” Dr. Koelemeijer said. But footsteps are far quieter than traffic  so seismometers won’t necessarily betray people who are evading the lockdown measures. “Whenever I look out onto the balcony these days  I still see too many people walking around ” Dr. Satriano said. Don’t be tempted by sunnier days ahead. “Stay home  stay safe ” he added. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/science/08VIRUS-SEISMIC-print/merlin_170792763_a5eb6aab-3f0f-4497-a6e1-35092132bca8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Its history since then traces a more complex path., Supported by Wheels A French automaker  an American heiress and a French-Jewish racer formed a team that beat Germany’s far more powerful cars in a 1938 Grand Prix. Its history since then traces a more complex path. By Jim Motavalli To put it mildly  all three were underdogs. It was the 1930s  and the French automaker Delahaye was struggling to stay afloat. Compared with the Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union teams generously financed by the Third Reich  Delahaye’s entries into racing competitions were underfunded and underpowered. Then  as it is now  auto racing was dominated by men  but the American heiress Lucy O’Reilly Schell had a passion for it. And a bank account to back it up. And René Dreyfus  a French racer who had notched key victories  and a Jew  was losing opportunities as Nazi-bred anti-Semitism spread across Europe. But together  these unlikely elements — financed by a highly determined Ms. Schell — formed a team that not only won a million-franc race for French automakers in 1937 but beat Hitler’s much more powerful cars in a celebrated Grand Prix event the next year  at least temporarily restoring French pride. Their story is told in “Faster ” a new book by Neal Bascomb that also delves into an enduring mystery — which of two American collectors owns the winning car today. “Lucy Schell was an absolute force of nature ” Mr. Bascomb said in an interview. “She and her husband were top-ranked Monte Carlo rally drivers. She was the first woman to fund the development of her own Grand Prix racing team  in the 1930s. Imagine what that took.” Their racing team  Écurie Bleue  fielded just four Delahaye 145 Grand Prix racers. The cars were powered by a new 4.5-liter  245-horsepower V-12 engine with a functional alloy body that Dreyfus said in his autobiography was the “most awful-looking automobile I ever saw.” They weren’t expected to win  but did  taking that so-called Prix du Million in 1937. Only French automakers were eligible  and Delahaye won the timed trial  in a lightened 145  by defeating Bugatti (which suffered mechanical problems) at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry outside Paris. The next year  the same team and quite likely the same car won the Pau Grand Prix on the Pyrenees’ northern edge  beating the hard-charging Germans Rudolf Caracciola and Hermann Lang in a Silver Arrow Mercedes-Benz W154 with more than 400 horsepower. The French course was twisty  which cut into the Germans’ power advantage. Also  the two Mercedes-Benz cars were less fuel-efficient than the Delahaye  which meant more frequent pit stops. When Caracciola pitted on Lap 52  Dreyfus took the lead  and won the race with a lead of almost two minutes over Mercedes. There was pandemonium in France  Mr. Bascomb wrote  though it didn’t last: “Throughout the rest of the 1938 season  Mercedes dominated.” But Dreyfus was named the Racing Champion of France. Hitler was furious  and was rumored to have sent a team to France to find and destroy the winning Delahaye. The book has been optioned to be made into a movie  and it is certainly a cinematic read  made more so by a contemporary addendum. The four Delahaye 145s are all in the United States  three in California owned by Peter Mullin  a premier collector of French cars. But the fourth  and possibly the Pau and Million Franc winner  is in Englewood  N.J.  and owned by a similarly respected collector and frequent Pebble Beach and Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance winner  Sam Mann. The history of racecars  with their frequent swapping of parts and even bodies  can be confusing. Mr. Mullin is convinced he owns the star car  and has amassed considerable documentation. And Mr. Mann has not one but two relevant cars — the chassis he believes belongs to the French race winner  but with an elegant art-deco cabriolet body by the French coachbuilder Franay  and a Delahaye 135M chassis with a timeworn but relatively recent racing body that once graced the other car. One looks the part  but it’s the other that is the actual competition contender. The New Jersey cars occupy pride of place in a second-floor display area that includes many other French marques  including Voisin  Bugatti and Delage. The cabriolet looks like a Champs-Élysées cruiser  and was displayed at Pebble Beach in 2015 — where it won its class and was chosen “most elegant convertible.” It also won prizes at the Amelia Island concours in 2017  where its history plaque identified it as the former V-12 Grand Prix winner  adding that it was sold to a private client in 1945  rebodied by Franay  then seized by the French government when the client was charged with wartime collaboration. Bought back by Franay  it was then sold to its first owner  “rumored to be Prince Rainier of Monaco ” but quite possibly someone less famous. This is not in dispute: In 1987  Dreyfus drove this car onto the Montlhéry track to commemorate the famous race’s 50th anniversary. The sports car body then on it  put there by a previous owner  was transferred to the 135 chassis after Mr. Mann’s purchase circa 1997. To complete the swap  Mr. Mann restored the Franay cabriolet coachwork to the 145. In New Jersey  Mr. Mann lifted the hood and showed the triple-carbureted V-12 that  he believes  carried Dreyfus to victory. Started up and driven out of its resting place  the car sounds nothing like a boulevardier  with the popping and spitting and pouring out smoke and brimstone. Mr. Mullin talked about the provenance of his car  with chassis number 48711  in an interview. There’s more in the Mullin Automotive Museum’s book  “French Curves ” written by the board member Richard Adatto. It is  understandably  a convoluted tale  but Mr. Mullin said: “The car was buried in France during the war  then it was on the grounds of the Montlhéry racetrack  then at the owner’s chateau. That this was the Million Franc car was unambiguously confirmed by the Department of Mines in France after I bought it in 1987.” A handwritten document from that agency  after a test at Montlhéry  says  “The vehicle tested (the Millionth vehicle) is chassis and engine number 48.711.” Mr. Mullin paid $150 000 for a car in pieces  with the front part of the bodywork missing  and had it restored in England over four years. “It’s very well balanced and a dream to drive ” he said. The Delahaye  with what Mr. Mullin said turned out to be a later Type 155 engine  is now one of many prizes permanently housed at the Mullin museum in Oxnard  Calif. That collection includes two other ex-Lucy Schell 145s that were later bodied for road use by the well-known coachbuilder Henri Chapron. Mr. Mullin said that Dreyfus  who settled in New York and became the celebrity owner of Le Chanteclair French restaurant in Manhattan  was “an extraordinarily talented driver” and a gentleman who “was not aggressive  except on the track. I was lucky to know him.” Dreyfus’s New York Times obituary in 1993 noted that he placed 10th at the Indianapolis 500 in 1940  and added that his restaurant “for 25 years was one of the more popular stops for international auto racers.” Despite their competing claims to the star car  the two collectors are longtime friends. “I know Peter thinks he has the correct car  and he cares more about it than I do  but we’re relying on documentation from the Delahaye club ” Mr. Mann said. “It’s a lifelong exploration  and at the end of the day it’s almost impossible to tell which car is the real one.” André Vaucourt  who has served as historian/archivist for Club Delahaye  established a timeline that traces the car through the Million Franc win  the victory at Pau  another win (without any German entries) in the Cork Grand Prix  an appearance at the Paris Auto Salon in 1946 and eventually through several owners to Mr. Mann. “It’s a war fought to a stalemate ” Mr. Bascomb said. “Both sides have advanced their experts. Both sides have produced reams of material — photographs  archival documents  supporting testimonies. Neither side has given an inch.” He added that it was common practice  especially in small operations such as Écurie Bleue  for parts to be swapped between cars — engines  brakes  even steering wheels. “If I was to bet ” Mr. Bascomb said  “I’d say they both own a piece of the car that beat Hitler.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/business/09wheels1/merlin_170921262_6bfa4015-1344-4bd0-8723-3c614eff5a05-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

In the present pandemic moment  there’s plenty to learn from standing still. Walden Pond  where Henry David Thoreau settled in semi-seclusion for nearly two years while working on his journals and on “Walden; or  Life in the Woods.”Credit...Cody O'Loughlin for The New York Times Supported by By Holland Cotter During most of his life Henry David Thoreau was  by conventional standards of success  a failure. He rarely left the farm town of Concord  Mass.  where he was born in 1817. There he was viewed by at least some of his neighbors as a marginal figure  standoffish  politically radical  a loner  a crank. As a member of the New England literary world he cut a graceless figure and had an inauspicious professional start. His first book  “A Week on the Concord and the Merrimack River ” self-published in 1849  was a bust. He sold a mere fraction of its 1 000-copy press run. When the printer dumped the remainders on him  Thoreau stacked them up in his bedroom and wrote in his journal: “I now have a library of nearly nine hundred volumes  over seven hundred of which I wrote myself.” His second book  “Walden; or  Life in the Woods ” based on his experience of living in a one-room cabin and in a state of rural semi-self-quarantine  found more readers. And  crucially  they were ardent ones. From the book’s first appearance in 1854 his star began to rise. And within 10 years of his death in 1862  at 44  he was famous enough to be honored with a public monument. An odd monument it was: a loose pile of stones set on the site of the one-room cabin Thoreau built at Walden Pond. The pile  usually referred to as a cairn  seems to have begun as an improvisation. In the summer of 1872  the suffragist Mary Newbury Adams  a Thoreau fan  visited Concord and asked to be taken to Walden. Her guide was the utopian thinker Bronson Alcott  one of Thoreau’s oldest friends. By this point  any physical trace of Thoreau was long gone and there was nothing to signal the site’s significance. Adams wanted to change that. In his diary Alcott writes: “Mrs. Adams suggests that visitors to Walden shall bring a small stone for Thoreau’s monument and she begins the pile by laying stones on the site of his hermitage.” He too added a stone that day  as did members of a local church group who happened to be picnicking nearby. Word went out and the custom spread as  over the years  more pilgrims came. (I was one of them.) The heap of stones  most harvested from the pond’s edge  is still growing (and shrinking; some people take stones away as souvenirs). Like many religious shrines  it’s organic  in perpetual flux. There are many different Thoreaus to commemorate: the environmentalist  the abolitionist  the ethnologist  the globalist  the anti-imperialist  the Yankee saint who earned the devotion of Tolstoy and Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. But to me  as a visitor to Walden since childhood  the cairn means most as the marker of an event: Thoreau’s two-year-plus experiment in self-isolation. It’s a condition many of us are experiencing during the present pandemic moment. And we can learn a lot from what Thoreau created from it: constructive solitude. It’s important to note that his isolation was not the sheltering-in-place kind. It was not enforced (unless you consider life-style decisions made by a driven personality and deeply principled thinker to be beyond free choice). And his apartness was far from total. He went into Concord several times a week to catch up on gossip and have dinner with his relatives. At Walden  he entertained guests and enjoyed regular chats with Irish laborers who worked on a railroad line close to the pond. At the same time  social distancing came naturally to him. He was  or could be  an irritable and thin-skinned guy  someone for whom the human species was a problem. (“I do not value any view of the universe into which man and institutions of man enter very largely ” he wrote.) When he was in a misanthropic mood  six to eight feet of separation wasn’t nearly enough. Try a mile and a half  which was the approximate distance from Walden to the center of town. But if the Walden cabin  about the size of a garden shed  was in some sense a retreat  a refuge from “the noise of my contemporaries ” it had many more positive functions: it was a studio  a laboratory  an observatory  and a watchtower. Reading “Walden” — or  better  his more lucidly written journals — as I have done these last weeks  we sense that Thoreau viewed the Walden outpost less as a defensive necessity than as a place of opportunity where he could do what he could not easily do in the everyday world: namely  concentrate  focus  which I’ve always suspected was a way for him to handle incipient anxiety and despondency. For one thing  he had that first book to write — an account of a boat trip he had taken several years earlier with his older brother John. The book would be Thoreau’s first attempt at the blend of field research  philosophy and autobiography that would become his signature mode. More important  the book would be a memorial to his beloved brother whose death from tetanus at 27 — he had nicked himself while shaving — shadowed Thoreau’s life. He used his semi-seclusion at Walden  which began in July 1845 and ended in September 1847  to pursue an intensive course in self-education  one that required undistracted reading. “Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written ” he wrote. The list he compiled was long  ambitious and culturally far-reaching  stretching from Classical Greece to Vedic India. In a letter to a friend he wrote: “The yogi  absorbed in contemplation  contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume  he hears wonderful things. To some extent  and at rare intervals  even I am a yogi.” He made his time at Walden one of those intervals. (Interestingly  during the present lockdown  several of my friends have returned to a practice of meditation that their pre-pandemic lives had left little time for.) The education further entailed a total immersion in Nature — in plants  in seasons  in stars  in all creatures four-legged  winged and scaled. For Thoreau  Nature was a communicating consciousness  and he wanted to make himself available to it  antennas raised. Full receptivity required removal from ego-driven clamor  which was how  in his most stressed moments  he viewed human discourse. Finally  he used his set-aside time at Walden to clarify his political thinking. For Thoreau  revolution began at home  one person at a time. “We must first succeed alone ” he wrote  “that we may enjoy our success together.” It was while living at Walden that he spent a night in jail for refusing to pay taxes that he saw as contributing to a warmongering  slavery-supporting government. At Walden he wrote the lecture that he would later shape into the essay known as “Civil Disobedience.” Thoreau left Walden in 1847 to take a job as a caretaker in the household of his off-and-on friend Ralph Waldo Emerson  who owned the land on which Thoreau had built his cabin. His departure was both sudden and logical. “I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live  and could not spare any more time for that one.” And he did have more lives  many; he once listed some of them: “I am a Schoolmaster — a Private Tutor  a Surveyor — a Gardener  a Farmer — a Painter  I mean a House Painter  a Carpenter  a Mason  a Day-Laborer  a Pencil-Maker  a Writer  and sometimes a Poetaster.” And this makes no mention of the activist  the naturalist  the moral philosopher  the self-exile and the utopian-community-of-one — that is  the Thoreau we care most about now. You might think of each stone on the Walden cairn as commemorating one of these identities or several intertwined. In his view  purposeful solitude and justice-minded community were codependent  the source of long-term social health. He knew what his view was up against: among other things  America’s antsy addiction to distraction and its led-by-the-nose  corporation-fed faith in utopian technology. And the call for civil resistance — individual and collective — that issued from his Walden shelter? It is still hot-to-the-touch. Thoreau was not a pacifist. He vehemently supported the armed raid led by the abolitionist John Brown at Harpers Ferry. When Brown was hanged  Thoreau delivered a furious public speech in Concord  standing under an upside-down United States flag. Surely the Civil War  underway when he died  came as no surprise. But the monument of stones at Walden is the opposite of angry  or declarative or  for that matter  monumental. It speaks of aloneness-within-solidarity — a message we need to hear these days — in a homely down-to-earth way  one that Thoreau  who scorned all pomp and eye-baiting elegance (he once described himself as a “stuttering  blundering clod/hoper”) might have approved of. It’s a monument designed by no one  built by everyone. It’s assembled one piece at a time  over time  by individuals who will never meet  but who  in our devotion  form a community of souls. It’s a monument that honors the dead  but is living  changing  growing. During the present crisis that is isolating us  this monument has the potential to bring us together: It is an instructive emblem to contemplate  and a consoling one.

Put on a Seder Show, , A homebound team of Oscar  Tony and Emmy winners are cooking up “Saturday Night Seder ” a streaming Passover event that is part variety show  fund-raiser and theatrical experience. Tan France  part of Saturday Night Seder.Credit...Jackson Krule for The New York Times Supported by By Katherine Rosman Like pretty much everybody in America blessed with good health these days  the actor Jason Alexander and his wife  the artist Daena Title  have been stuck at home  worried about their relatives  their friends and a nation whose future is uncertain. “We all want to try to do something  anything ” Alexander said. But what? About a week ago  he found an answer  in an email from Benj Pasek  the lyricist who helped create the songs for the Broadway musical “Dear Evan Hansen ” as well as the movies “The Greatest Showman” and “La La Land ” which earned him a share in an Academy Award. The songwriter’s pitch to Alexander was this: “Would you be interested in being a part of an all-star online Seder fund-raiser that will raise money for the C.D.C. Foundation?” This was something Alexander could do. On Tuesday  his wife arranged lighting in their dining room and held an iPhone as he rehearsed an original musical number  which they then recorded. He sang: “So you’re stressed by all the stories that you’ve seen on cable news? Well  it’s time to trade the cable for a tableful of Jews. While this night is always different from every other night  there is a smidgen of religion though we’re keeping that part light. Tonight is stranger than a normal Pesach meal  ’cause we’re locked in our apartment and the plagues are [expletive] real.” “Nailed it!” said Erich Bergen  a star of “Madam Secretary” who  of late  has become a go-to technical producer for logistically complicated endeavors  like the recent fund-raising  one-night return of “The Rosie O’Donnell Show.” (He was in Alexander’s dining room too  thanks to Zoom. But actually  he was sitting at a desk in front of his unmade bed in his apartment in Harlem.) “Let’s do one more take ” Title said. She later explained  with a little panic  that she hadn’t actually hit the record button. Such are the dramas inherent in producing a show that relies on iPhones and dozens of performers — including Ben Platt  Billy Porter  Judith Light  Tan France  Harvey Fierstein  Idina Menzel and Sarah Silverman — who are all in different places. The result — God willing  because as of this writing it’s nowhere near done — will be “Saturday Night Seder.” It’s an original telling of the Passover story meant to entertain and bring together a mainstream audience for a few laughs  a bit of joy and some unavoidable reflections on the human capacity for transcendence amid danger and chaos. It will be streamed on the “Saturday Night Seder” website and on YouTube at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday  April 11. (With some words beeped out  it’s PG-13 family viewing.) “The Passover holiday is literally a story of going from confinement to freedom and from winter to spring ” said Pasek  who a few years ago teamed with the Broadway performer Adam Kantor to reimagine the biblical story of exodus for more than 100 people in New York. This year  amid the health crisis of Covid-19  rising unemployment and near-nationwide quarantine  Pasek and Kantor knew they needed to dip into their creative circles of colleagues  friends and friends of friends (of friends) to help share the story  with all its modern resonances  with a much larger audience. And to raise money while doing so. “At the Seder table  we ask ourselves  ‘What can you do for people who are suffering because you once suffered?’” Pasek said. “We want to amplify that message because it is one of hope and also one that asks people to give of themselves however they can.” Kantor  whose sister-in-law is a new mother and a nurse practitioner caring for Covid-19 patients at Bellevue Hospital in New York  helped write songs and wrangle actors  and he is overseeing the fund-raising drive to benefit the C.D.C. Foundation. “We want to support the front lines ” he said. The “Saturday Night Seder” team  including the writers Alex Edelman and Hannah Friedman; musical arrangers like Charlie Rosen and Ben Wexler; and the composer Shaina Taub  among many others  had about two weeks to put it together  using Slack  Dropbox  Zoom and a color-coded Google Sheet full of Talmudic detail that producers like Talia Halperin used to manage the rehearsal and taping availability of rabbis  writers and Fran Dreschers. Everyone is doing every job. “At one point ” Bergen said  “I found myself writing a letter to Oprah to see if she could participate  and then a minute later I was editing a video of a drag queen saying  ‘Yas  Passover!’ so it runs the gamut. If we pull it off — and that’s an if — it will be a miracle.” The first week of April  the creators met in a Zoom writers room for about 18 hours a day  piecing together a program that would have elements of awards shows  television variety specials and Broadway revues. This week  they worked directly with the talent  watching them rehearse and film the various elements while providing tech support to some people whose many gifts don’t include knowing how to upload files to the cloud. Most every recording session brought one technical glitch or another. The actor and singer Josh Groban was relying on his iPad both to communicate with the producers on Zoom and to listen to the instrumental version of the track he was singing to. He needed to quit the Zoom app to make his recording. Before Groban left the Zoom room to sing and record himself  the producers gave him direction  including a request that when citing the Passover song “Chad Gadya ” as his bit calls on him to do  that he pronounces “chad” with a throat-clearing cccchhh. Groban went offline to do his thing  then returned to Zoom and shared his recording with the group. He sounded like a cantor  cccchhh and all. (Groban was not raised Jewish  but like many of the other men involved in “Saturday Night Seder ” he played Tevye in a school production of “Fiddler on the Roof.”) Rachel Brosnahan is also not a Jew  but she plays one on TV. Just as Mrs. Maisel might do  Brosnahan found the bright side of having to film her contribution from home. In the song she will sing for the show  she tells people not to worry if this year they lack the foods typically placed on a Seder plate. As Brosnahan practiced the lyrics — “If you’re out of greens and table salt  well  don’t you fret my dears. Just use a stick of celery to wipe away your tears” — she burst with an idea of her own. “I have a stick of celery!” she told the producers and bound into her kitchen to fetch it. On the next take  she brushed the stalk across her face as if to dry a tear  and punctuated the end of her line with a crunchy bite. Some of the actors were already Zoom proficient. Henry Winkler  who narrates the Moses story  has been zooming with his children and grandchildren the past three Sundays. When he was approached to take part in the production by Kantor  whom Winkler didn’t know but with whom he had posed for a photo after seeing Kantor perform in “The Band’s Visit” on Broadway  he agreed immediately and asked to be given a part that let him reflect on the meaning of Passover in this particular time in history. “As a citizen  even more than as a Jew ” Winkler said  “I thought it was our responsibility to tell the story as it has been told for over 5 000 years  because it’s a story about survival and renewal.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/sports/athletes-doctors-coronavirus.html, sports, They Played Sports at the Highest Level. Now Their Job Is to Save Lives., Hayley Wickenheiser  who won four Olympic gold medals as a hockey player  is now a medical student and among the elite athletes using their skills and platforms to fight the coronavirus., Supported by Hayley Wickenheiser  who won four Olympic gold medals as a hockey player  is now a medical student and among the elite athletes using their skills and platforms to fight the coronavirus. By Salim Valji The four-time Olympic gold medalist Hayley Wickenheiser of Canada was around 10 years old when she first had the idea of being both a professional hockey player and a doctor. Wickenheiser  now 41  grew up in Shaunavon  Saskatchewan  a town of fewer than 2 000 people and less than two square miles in size. A young girl in the area had been severely injured after getting hit by a grocery delivery van. “I remember going to the hospital with all the kids in the neighborhood and just being really inspired and intrigued by the doctors and nurses that were taking care of her ” Wickenheiser said in a telephone interview. “That’s how it all started. At that age  I had two goals: to play for the Edmonton Oilers and to go to Harvard Medical School.” After retiring in 2017 as Team Canada’s career scoring leader  Wickenheiser enrolled in medical school at the University of Calgary  then took on the role as an assistant director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2018. She was in the midst of her clinical rotation in emergency rooms around Toronto two weeks ago  when medical students and trainees were pulled from their assignments as the number of coronavirus cases in the country reached a critical point. As of Tuesday afternoon  there have been more than 1.3 million coronavirus cases and 81 106 virus-related deaths recorded worldwide. More than 30 percent of those diagnosed cases are in the United States. Canada is home to more than 17 000 cases  or just over 1 percent. Medical students aren’t allowed to directly treat patients who have contracted Covid-19  so Wickenheiser has been gathering personal protective equipment  or P.P.E.  for front line workers and helping with contact tracing of diagnosed patients to track the spread of the virus. “I remember when the first Covid patient came through the emergency room doors in the hospital I was at  one of the doctors I was with did not physically want to go into the room ” she said. “They didn’t feel protected or that they had enough P.P.E. and they didn’t really know what they were dealing with.” One morning in early March  after a particularly unsettling shift  Wickenheiser  a member of the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Commission  was stunned to read that the I.O.C. still was planning for the Summer Olympics to continue as scheduled in Tokyo starting in July. “I kept on seeing this blatant  ‘We are going ahead no matter what ’ kind of attitude and I just thought  ‘How can you be speaking?’” she said. “It was making me crazy. Every day I was losing sleep listening to this dialogue.” Wickenheiser voiced her concerns to Canadian and international Olympic leaders before publishing a statement to her social media accounts on March 17 imploring the I.O.C. to make a decision about postponing or canceling the Games. “I think the I.O.C. insisting this will move ahead  with such conviction  is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity ” she wrote. “We don’t know what’s happening in the next 24 hours  let alone in the next three months.” Five days later  the Canadian Olympic Committee announced it would not send the country’s athletes to Tokyo in 2020 and called on the I.O.C. to postpone the games  a decision the I.O.C. made with the Japanese government on March 24. Wickenheiser has since been in contact with the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to help promote social distancing advisories to the public and has contributed to his #plankthecurve social media campaign. She isn’t the only elite athlete now on the front lines in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif  the N.F.L.’s only active player with a medical degree  said he had only a basic understanding of the virus when he was asked about it by a reporter during media interviews ahead of the Super Bowl. Duvernay-Tardif  who got his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal  hopes to specialize in emergency medicine but isn’t currently part of a medical residency program and cannot assist doctors and other medical staff in treating patients. After he returned from his post-Super Bowl sailing vacation  he reached out to Quebec government officials asking how he could help. Like Wickenheiser  Duvernay-Tardif has been using his social media platforms to communicate vetted health care guidance to his followers  totaling nearly 200 000 between Instagram and Twitter. “So far I’ve done a bunch of interviews and gone live on different platforms  reinforcing how important it is to do social distancing  basic hygiene like hand-washing  and how we’re going to manage this thing ” Duvernay-Tardif said in a telephone interview. Myron Rolle was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in 2010 and spent three seasons playing professional football before retiring to pursue a career in medicine. Rolle  a Rhodes Scholar  is currently a neurosurgery resident at the Harvard Medical School and at Massachusetts General Hospital  where he treats patients with various ailments  including ones that show signs of the Covid-19. Massachusetts has the United States’ fourth highest rate of infection per capita  with 15 202 reported cases. “I think the biggest surprise for me is how infectious it is ” he said. “People had mentioned that it’s similar to the flu or common cold  but this virus goes from person to person without discrimination.” Regardless of their specialties  all three athletes drew parallels between competing in professional sports and working in the health care field. They said skills like time management  managing intense pressure and perseverance were easily transferable between vocations. “Football’s taught me discipline  focus  hard work  dedication  teamwork  preparation  and overcoming adversity ” Rolle said. Wickenheiser has related her medical colleagues’ traits to her athletic peers as a way of supporting their efforts during the current crisis. “I was talking to a friend who has been an emergency physician for 20 years and she was describing how she had to shut down communications with friends because she was getting text messages from people saying how they were so sorry for her and grieving that she had to do her job and she didn’t feel that way at all ” Wickenheiser said. “I said  ‘This is your med Olympics. This is like the Olympics for you. Yes  you’re at risk  but you’re also really damn good at your job and smart  and you’re going to do everything you can to protect yourself and your staff.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

By Kevin Draper and Oskar Garcia U.F.C. 249  a mixed-martial arts showcase scheduled for April 18 on Native American tribal land in California  was canceled on Thursday in response to apprehension about holding the event during the coronavirus pandemic. California state officials intervened by directly expressing their concerns about the event to Disney  the parent company of the U.F.C.’s broadcast partner  ESPN  according to three people with knowledge of the conversations. Dana White  the U.F.C. president  said in an interview on ESPN that he had received calls from “the highest level” of leadership at Disney and ESPN asking him not to hold the event  which would have featured 12 fights. ESPN holds the rights to televise U.F.C. fights and to sell its pay-per-view events  a lucrative relationship that yields the vast majority of the U.F.C.’s revenue. “The powers that be there asked me to stand down and not do this event next Saturday ” White said. That request came after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called Disney officials  according to one of the people familiar with the conversations. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the details of the calls. Disney declined to comment  and Newsom’s office did not respond to a request for comment. “ESPN has been in constant contact with the U.F.C. regarding U.F.C. 249 ” ESPN said in a statement. “Nobody wants to see sports return more than we do  but we didn’t feel this was the right time for a variety of reasons. ESPN expressed its concerns to the U.F.C. and they understood.” An hour before White announced the cancellation  Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had called for the event to be postponed. In a statement  she said that “at best this event ties up medical resources and sends a message that shelter-in-place orders can be flouted” and that “at worst  participants and support staff could carry the virus back to their home communities and increase its spread.” The card was originally scheduled for Barclays Center in Brooklyn  but was moved after Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York restricted mass gatherings and the New York State Athletic Commission announced it wouldn’t authorize the event  The fights were then to be held at the Tachi Palace Casino Resort  on tribal land in Central California about 40 miles south of Fresno. In staging the event on tribal land  the U.F.C. was attempting to get around stay-at-home orders that have been issued in nearly every state  including California  as well as federal social distancing guidelines. California state regulators refused to authorize the event  and most state athletic commissions aren’t approving fights during the pandemic. As a result  the U.F.C. would have had to provide its own referees  judges  medical staff and other services to make the bouts happen. The Tachi-Yokut Tribe  part of the federally recognized Santa Rosa Indian Community  owns the Tachi Palace Casino Resort. They have sovereignty over their land and can set whatever rules they want  though the casino was closed the night of March 20 because of the pandemic. But because of a nearly 70-year-old federal law  Public Law 280  California state and local officials have broad authority to intervene in criminal and civil matters on tribal land. By expressing their concerns to Disney  California state officials avoided a potentially complicated and uncomfortable situation with the Tachi-Yokut. The U.F.C. had previously canceled three events that were scheduled for March and April  and White said on Thursday that his efforts to keep U.F.C. 249 intact had been “a battle since Day 1.” He has insisted that he was being cautious and could safely hold the fights even amid a pandemic and despite a number of medical  legal and regulatory challenges. As recently as Wednesday night  the event’s key stakeholders were adamant that it would go ahead  noting that the U.F.C. was able to host fights in an empty arena in Brazil last month. “Precedent has been set  and Dana knows that he can pull this off in a very safe and controlled way that will keep his fighters and the crew safe ” Mark Shapiro  the president of Endeavor  said in a telephone interview Wednesday night. Endeavor led the group that purchased the U.F.C. in 2016. Disney is based in Burbank  Calif.  and has extensive financial interests in the state  through its theme parks  movie and television studios  and its Pixar and Lucasfilm subsidiaries. ESPN does not control U.F.C.’s fight schedule  but it has substantial influence over the company given the strong financial ties between the two organizations. “These are people that I am partners with  people whom I have a lot of respect with  and I’m going to do it  I’m going to say yes ” White said about the requests from Disney and ESPN to postpone the fight. In 2018  ESPN agreed to pay the U.F.C. $1.5 billion over five years to show 30 events annually on the network’s cable channels and on its ESPN+ streaming service. ESPN executives have credited the U.F.C. with being a major driver of ESPN+ subscriptions  and the agreement was deemed such a success that just one year later it was extended by two years and ESPN also bought the exclusive rights to sell and stream U.F.C.’s pay-per-view events. The value of the latter deal was not announced  but the U.F.C.’s pay-per-view events typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually. ESPN was going to charge $64.99 to watch U.F.C. 249. Shapiro said that business considerations were not behind the U.F.C.’s unwavering desire to hold U.F.C. 249 despite a worldwide pandemic  and that ESPN had not pressured them to go forward. The U.F.C. produces all of its own events  sending video feeds to ESPN to televise  and ESPN would not have had any production staff on the ground in California. “The U.F.C.’s contractual relationship with ESPN has absolutely nothing to do with this decision ” Shapiro said on Wednesday. “ESPN has been clear about that.” The headline fight for U.F.C. 249 was originally a lightweight title bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson  one of the U.F.C.’s most anticipated matchups in years. But Nurmagomedov traveled from San Jose  Calif.  where he was training  to his home in the Dagestan region of Russia as White was still trying to find a backup location for the fight. Then Nurmagomedov withdrew when it became clear he would have problems traveling back to the United States to compete. Earlier on Thursday  Brian Butler  the manager of the strawweight fighter Rose Namajunas  said she had withdrawn from her bout in U.F.C. 249 because two of her family members had died. Their deaths  Butler said  “were related to the coronavirus.” Butler added on Instagram  “Her hopes are to return to the octagon as soon as possible.” White said U.F.C. 249 was part of a broader plan to maintain a regular schedule of fights — starting with two months of events at the casino. He said on Thursday that he still planned to hold events for fighters on a private island outside the United States. “Fight island is real — it’s a real thing ” White said. “The infrastructure is being built right now.” Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/sports/wimbledon-british-open-cancel-coronavirus.html, sports, In Britain  Summer Sports Cancellations Just Hit Different, The losses of Wimbledon and the British Open  hallmarks of summer in Britain  feel merely hypothetical  since soccer usually sets the rhythm of everyday life., Supported by Essay The losses of Wimbledon and the British Open  hallmarks of summer in Britain  feel merely hypothetical  since soccer usually sets the rhythm of everyday life. By Rory Smith The British summer is a confounding  elusive thing. Some years  it is long and warm and hazy  with endless months of blue skies and hosepipe bans  spent drinking in beer gardens and making sincere promises that  next year  we won’t need to bother going abroad. Some years  it is as though it does not come at all. It is spring one day  fall the next  the only apparent difference a distinct change in the nature of the rain. Often  summer seems to be condensed into a single week in May  and perhaps  with luck  a brief  tantalizing reprise on the first weekend of August. But the British feeling of summer — the point at which people start wearing shorts  regardless of the actual weather  and stockpiling Pimms  regardless of the taste — is different. It runs on a fixed schedule: High summer arrives late in June and runs  uninterrupted  through to August. Its rhythm  its introduction  crescendo and conclusion  are set not by the temperature: That is far too unreliable. Instead  cultural landmarks denote the shift in seasons. The British summer  most years  is bookended by two festivals: Glastonbury  in June  and Edinburgh  in August. But it is defined  ultimately  by sport. The dates for this year’s British summer  then  could be known a year ago: Wimbledon was due to start the day after Glastonbury  on June 29. It would conclude on July 12  the same day as the British Open  Europe’s only men’s golf major  was scheduled to get underway. A week later  the final round at Royal St. George’s  in Kent  would have coincided with the British installment of Formula One’s world championship  at Silverstone  in Northamptonshire. Over the last few weeks  all but one have fallen by the wayside. Glastonbury was canceled on March 18. Wimbledon — and the Edinburgh festival — went on April 1. The Open was struck from the schedule on April 6. For now  the British Grand Prix remains in place  but a decision on its fate is due at the end of the month. Formula One has already canceled nine races this season. Much of the cricket season  that other great fixture of summer  may go the same way: The Hundred  a much-derided new format  is likely to be postponed; the County Championship  a stalwart since 1890  could yet be canceled. Each announcement  in an ordinary news cycle  would have generated substantial shock. As the organizers of both Wimbledon and the Open mentioned in their respective statements  only World War II has ever stopped both from being played. In this news cycle  though  their cancellations passed with little more than a shrug from the populace here. That is  of course  in part because minds are on the much more pressing concern of the soaring death tolls of the coronavirus pandemic; in part it is because  locked down and scared  few would have assumed those landmarks of summer were going to happen anyway. The shock of each new day  same as the old day  pounds the senses so that it seems even to distort time. Every day lasts a week  more. The day after Wimbledon had been canceled  the news felt like ancient history. But the lack of sentiment is rooted  too  in the nature of stand-alone sporting events. Golf  tennis and motor sport all have significant  devoted followings for whom these are the highlights of the year  and to much of the public they are as much cultural occasions — like Glastonbury  like Edinburgh — as sporting ones. For most  those events are not consumed live  but remotely  from the comfort of a living room and are only engaged with in the moment. The disappearance of those summer milestones contrasted with the disruption to soccer is instructive as to the role they play in the British national consciousness. For many  soccer is part of the background noise of daily life. It is not something to savor  to look forward to. It is  in normal times  just there. In Britain  soccer sets the rhythm not of one season but of the week: Tuesday and Wednesday evenings in spring are Champions League nights; there is a twinge of excitement when the clock hits three on a Saturday  even if your team is not playing; Monday actually starts at 6:30 p.m. on a Sunday  when the final game of the weekend draws to a close. Soccer is sport as soap opera and friend  as identity and addiction  and its absence is tangible: Something that was there is not here. Not just in terms of numbers — for 40 weeks of the year  millions reliably turn up in person to watch soccer of varying quality — but in terms of engagement. The absence of Wimbledon and the Open is  for now  hypothetical. The season was suspended  indefinitely  on March 13; the leagues and clubs remain determined to finish it  at some point  but when that will be remains entirely unclear. It is different  of course  to be deprived of something that was underway and to lose something that was yet to start  but our interaction with soccer is different to our interaction with  say  Wimbledon. That will change. Perhaps we will feel it immediately  in yawning days not filled; perhaps it will be a little later  when we realize something has been missed. That is the truest characteristic of the British summer  whenever it comes  however long it lasts: you notice it most when it is not there at all.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/virus-mask-wearing.html, world europe, Mask-Wearing Is a Very New Fashion in Paris (and a Lot of Other Places), To stem the coronavirus outbreak  European nations and even the United States are starting to adopt the wearing of masks in public  a practice long established in Asia., Supported by To stem the coronavirus outbreak  European nations and even the United States are starting to adopt the wearing of masks in public  a practice long established in Asia. By Norimitsu Onishi and Constant Méheut PARIS — Until a few weeks ago  Asian tourists were the only mask-wearers in Paris  eliciting puzzlement or suspicion from French locals  or even hostility as the coronavirus began sweeping across Europe. Four days into a national lockdown to stem the outbreak  the French government spokeswoman  Sibeth Ndiaye  warned that face masks were so unfamiliar that wearing them was too difficult technically and could even be “counterproductive.” Even on Thursday morning  when asked whether she wore a mask or made her children wear one  she said  “Oh  no  not at all.” This taboo is falling fast  not only in France but across Western countries  after mounting cries from experts who say the practice is effective in curbing the coronavirus pandemic. The shift for Western nations is profound and has had to overcome not merely the logistical challenges of securing enough masks  which are significant enough  but also a deep cultural resistance and even stigma associated with mask-wearing  which some Western leaders described flatly as “alien.” Seemingly  it won’t be for much longer. After discouraging people from wearing face masks  France  like the United States  has begun urging its citizens to wear basic or homemade ones outside. And some parts of Europe are moving faster than the United States by requiring masks instead of simply recommending their use. This week  Austria moved to become the fourth European nation to require masks in public  after the Czech Republic  Slovakia and Turkey. On Wednesday  Sceaux  a small city just south of Paris  became the first municipality in France to require masks in public. Violators will face a fine of 38 euros  or $41. The southern city of Nice announced that it would make masks mandatory next week  and the Paris mayor said on Tuesday that two million reusable cloth masks would be distributed there. Italian officials in Lombardy  the most stricken region in the world’s hardest-hit nation  made mask-wearing outside mandatory on Sunday. In France  a strong belief that the French would culturally reject the practice — and confidence that masks could be imported quickly if needed — has contributed to a desperate shortage. In the past decade  France’s formidable national stockpile of masks shrank from 1.7 billion to 150 million at the outset of the current pandemic. The debate over the simple face mask has sometimes evolved into a larger discussion over the role of the individual in society  pitting the West’s individualism against Asia’s collectivism. President Trump appeared to embody that ambivalence when  even as he announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now endorsed widespread mask-wearing  he said he would not wear one himself. Frédéric Keck  a French anthropologist specializing in pandemics  said that  in the West  mask-wearing was seen through an individual’s perspective. “‘There’s a virus outside  so I wear a mask only to protect myself ’” Mr. Keck said  “whereas collective reasoning  in Asian societies  is to say  ‘I wear a mask to protect others.’” The difference in mind-set is a crucial one given the nature of all but the highest-grade masks: Masks are believed to have some effectiveness at protecting the wearer  especially in crowded spaces  but are most effective at reducing the risks that the virus will be spread through coughing or talking. The French government initially said that the vast majority of people need not wear face masks because they didn’t guarantee the wearer protection. In Asia  and in a few European nations  the logic has been fundamentally different: If all individuals wear masks  the society will be protected. On Monday  Austria made masks mandatory in supermarkets and drugstores  and riders of public transportation will also be required to wear them next week. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that the change would require a “big adjustment” because “masks are alien to our culture.” But masks were also alien to Asia until it was struck by the SARS pandemic in 2003. In Japan  after people got used to masks  they continued to wear them against seasonal allergies or to protect one another from germs. Unlike in other Asian nations  where many wear masks against air pollution  mask-wearing became widespread despite the absence of immediate threats. Mask-wearing has become such a part of daily life that it now plays a role in maintaining an overall feeling of being “reassured” in Japanese society  said Yukiko Iida  an expert on masks at the Environmental Control Center  an environmental consulting company based in Tokyo. “When you put on a mask  you’re not inconveniencing others when you cough ” Ms. Iida said. “You’re showing others that you’re abiding by social etiquette  and so people feel reassured.” The debate over masks has focused on the divide between the West and Asia. But even inside the West  sharp differences have emerged. On March 18  the Czech Republic became the first nation in Europe to make mask-wearing mandatory  followed by Slovakia on March 25. Though neither was used to it  people across both countries mobilized by sewing masks at home  often giving them away to doctors  nurses and shop assistants or leaving them on their doors or gates to offer to passers-by. In Slovakia  television anchors and politicians took the lead  wearing masks in studios and outside. During the swearing-in ceremony of a new government  President Zuzana Caputova wore a red one that matched her dress  helping to remove the stigma. The mass mobilization in both countries reinforced what experts say is a crucial factor in fighting any epidemic: solidarity. “When we both have a face mask  I protect you  you protect me ” said a Czech actress in a widely shared video that featured the country’s minister of health and urged other nations to make masks mandatory. Slovakia and the Czech Republic were quicker to embrace face masks  experts said  in part because of their Communist legacy’s emphasis on collectivism. “People simply learned to be obedient in critical moments ” said Michal Vasecka  a sociologist at the Bratislava Policy Institute. By contrast  in France  where a sense of individualism is stronger  even government officials were long pessimistic about the adoption of mask-wearing against potential epidemics. In fact  so ingrained was the cultural resistance to masks that  as a security measure  France became in 2011 the first European nation to ban the public covering of the face  including with the Muslim veil. A 2010 report by the French Senate  the upper house of Parliament  noted that the practice had been met with “cultural reluctance that has proved insurmountable in the short term.” It added  “More than an act of individual or altruistic protection  wearing a mask is seen as stigmatizing.” Jean-François Mattéi  a former health minister and the current president of France’s National Academy of Medicine  said that because of the cultural reluctance and budgetary problems  maintaining the national stockpile might have been pushed down the list of government priorities. In 2009  in face of the H1N1 pandemic  France had amassed 1.7 billion masks  but stocks had fallen to 150 million at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic  according to a recent report by the academy. “This decision was absurd  and we’re seeing the consequences now ” said Philippe Juvin  the head of the emergency department at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris. Faced with shortages  which it first denied  the French government discouraged people from wearing masks  saying only the sick should wear them in public and that they were otherwise not useful. But the recommendations not only failed to convince French people who thronged pharmacies in search of masks  but they also conflicted with images of President Emmanuel Macron wearing a mask when he visited a military field hospital in eastern France on March 25. Though the French government has yet to make masks mandatory  powerful groups  like the Academy of Medicine  have recommended that they be. Mr. Mattéi said that wearing masks during epidemics was likely to “become the norm” in Western countries after the end of the pandemic  adding  “I’m convinced that pretty soon everyone in a family will have their two or three reusable face masks.” Daniel Illouz  a pharmacist in eastern Paris  said that he had been skeptical of the government’s repeated message that widespread mask-wearing was not helpful in fighting the epidemic. “I don’t see why in all the Asian countries  where they have masks  it would work  but it wouldn’t work for us ” he said.

But for many  isolation can quickly turn into deprivation., Supported by Indigenous people across the Americas are trying to defend their communities from the pandemic. But for many  isolation can quickly turn into deprivation. By Julie Turkewitz BOGOTÁ  Colombia — Every morning at a school in the vast desert along the Colombian coast  40 children  all part of the country’s largest Indigenous group  the Wayuu  gather before class for breakfast. For many of them  the morning arepa — a traditional corn meal pastry  stuffed with meat — is their only meal of the day. But since Colombia went into quarantine and schools shut down two weeks ago  Josefa García  a school administrator  has not received any of these meals from the country’s ministry of education. Nor have those children. And many of the students  some of whom have watched their brothers and sisters die of malnutrition in this remote and often neglected region  are starting to worry about survival. “Our fear is that if we don’t die of the virus ” said Ms. García  68  “we will die of hunger.” The global spread of the new coronavirus has put millions of Indigenous people on high alert  aware that just a few cases could spell disaster in places far from hospitals or with little access to soap and water. But along with concern about future infections are concerns about tonight’s dinner  or tomorrow’s lunch. Many Native communities are unprepared for months of economic paralysis. And in the worst cases  isolation measures are already causing emergencies. “The little food we had left is gone ” said Adolfo Jusayú  55  a father of four young boys. Last week  with his income as a taxi driver halted by Colombia’s countrywide quarantine  all he could give his boys for the day was a drink made of cornmeal called chicha and a single arepa each. Across the Americas  diseases brought in by outsiders once erased or devastated many Native nations  and this legacy remains strong in collective memories. In recent decades  diseases like measles and swine flu have wreaked havoc on some communities. Already  more than a dozen Indigenous groups have reported cases of Covid-19  including the Yukpa in northern Colombia  the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory in southeastern Canada and the Navajo in the southwestern United States. In Brazil  Joenia Wapichana  the country’s only Indigenous member of congress  warned recently that the coronavirus could represent “one more genocide” for Native communities. In response  many Indigenous leaders have taken protective measures into their own hands  in some cases building hand-washing stations within their territories  sealing off their lands and setting up border patrols. Sometimes  these measures have been effective. In other instances  leaders are finding their efforts thwarted. In Colombia  which has about 2 000 of the more than 30 000 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Latin America  Indigenous leaders in the mountainous department of Cauca were threatened by drug trafficking groups after they closed their borders by setting up 69 control points protected by 1 200 guards. In a March 20 letter publicized on social media  dissident members of the FARC  one of Colombia’s militant groups  said Indigenous patrols found “impeding our mobility” left them “no choice but to act with our arms.” Years after a peace deal between the FARC and the Colombian government  a swirl of guerrilla groups  paramilitary organizations and crime syndicates remain in the region  and  increasingly  Indigenous people who try to interfere with illegal activity have been found dead. Elsewhere  including in Ecuador and Brazil  Native leaders have petitioned large oil or mining companies to halt work in their regions  fearful of contamination from outside workers. They have had limited success. “We are very concerned ” said Andrew Werk  president of the Fort Belknap Indian Community in north central Montana  after news that the company TC Energy would continue building the Keystone XL pipeline  a 1 200-mile project that drew protests in 2016. Thousands of workers are expected to arrive in the area this summer. The United States government considers pipeline layers to be “essential critical infrastructure workers ” who can be exempted from health-related stop-work orders. In a statement  the president of TC Energy  Russ Girling  said the company would take measures to “ensure the safety of our crews and community members during the current Covid-19 situation.” Few places have felt the effects of the virus as strongly as the northern Colombia coastal state of La Guajira  where the Wayuu make up about half of the 800 000 residents. After surviving war  revolution and generations in one of the region’s harshest landscapes  the Wayuu now find themselves hammered by quarantine-related hunger. So far  there is just one case of the virus in La Guajira. But Colombia’s nationwide quarantine has paralyzed the department’s tourism and trade economies  shuttering businesses based around small urban centers and leaving parents unable to buy the week’s rice  fish or cornmeal. Mr. Jusayú  the driver with four hungry boys  was once among the more successful people in the town of Siapana  saving his money to trade in his mud home for a concrete one. But recently  Mr. Jusayú has been chasing rabbits  looking for meat. At night  he gathers the children — Aldemar  2  Juan  4  Jaiber  6 and Eduard  9 — in their home  where they open their Bible and pray. “More than anything we pray about what’s happening in the world ” he said. “We need immediate help ” he went on  speaking of the situation in La Guajira. “This an emergency.” Celina Pushaina  a mother of five who lives in Niño Wayuu  a neighborhood in the city of Uribia  said her bicycle taxi was confiscated by the police in the early days of the quarantine  after she tried to continue working. Working was an act of desperation  she said. Now her children are living on donated rice. “If I don’t earn money ” she said  “I don’t buy and we go hungry.” María Sijuana  who lives in the city of Puerto López  said her three young children have been surviving mostly on chicha and fried pasta since the quarantine began. “The future is up to God ” she said. For the Wayuu  the crisis comes in the dry season  and after several years of difficult dry seasons that have exacerbated a longstanding problem of malnutrition. The crisis also comes as thousands of Wayuu have fled economic collapse in neighboring Venezuela. About 1.5 million people overall have arrived in recent years from Venezuela. The Colombian government has been working to support vulnerable communities amid the virus’s spread. In March  President Iván Duque said the government would send a one-time payment of about $40 to some of the country’s poorest families. The ministry of education has also promised to continue its critical school meal program by sending food into millions of homes  a project that will be countrywide by April 20. But logistics are complex in this nation of about 50 million people that is trisected by mountain ranges and connected by long desert roads. And unable to wait that long  some Wayuu people have begun blocking roads with sticks and branches  trying to publicize their cause. Some aid groups have scrambled to redesign programs. The World Food Programme office in La Guajira had to shutter 9 of its 13 community kitchens to protect public health  but is offering food packages instead. Mercy Corps  which gives monthly cash support to about 1 600 families in the department  advanced the mid-April payout by about three weeks. The group plans to begin distributing hygiene kits soon  which could be critical in an area where thousands do not have regular access to soap or clean water. Some Wayuu leaders  pointing out that most of their neighbors have long lacked the basics  said these problems might have been prevented had the government fulfilled duties to protect Wayuu laid out in a 2017 decision by the country’s Constitutional Court. “I am certain the Wayuu will survive ” said Weildler Guerra Curvelo  a Wayuu anthropologist and the former governor of La Guajira. But “what will be the cost of survival  in human lives  to this community that has resisted so much?” he asked. “How will the authorities help to make sure the cost is as small as possible?” Reporting was contributed by Dan Bilefsky in Montreal; María Iguarán in Medellín  Colombia; and Ernesto Londoño in Rio de Janeiro.

Mr. Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after a 10-day bout with the virus and transferred to the intensive care unit on Monday after his condition deteriorated. On Thursday  Downing Street said the prime minister  55  had been moved back to a ward at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London and was in “extremely good spirits.” Dominic Raab  Britain’s caretaker leader  said that Mr. Johnson had made “positive steps” in his recovery  though he offered no timetable for when he might return to work. He also signaled that the government would extend the country’s lockdown beyond next week. Mr. Raab  the foreign secretary deputized by Mr. Johnson to carry out his duties  said the government would not lift restrictions on April 13  the date the prime minister had set when he imposed the measures last month. The lockdown now appears likely to last several more weeks. “Is it time to ease up on the rules?” Mr. Raab said to reporters at 10 Downing Street. “We’re not done yet. We’ve got to keep going.” Mr. Raab said he had not spoken to Mr. Johnson since he was hospitalized on Sunday night. Now that he is out of intensive care  the prime minister “will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery ” the government said in a statement. Despite the good news  Mr. Raab appeared to be adjusting to the reality that Mr. Johnson will still be convalescing as the government faces one of the most sensitive decisions of the pandemic: when  and how  to reopen the British economy. The cabinet plans to make that assessment at the end of next week. “We in the government have got this covered ” Mr. Raab said when asked whether he had the power to make that decision. The debate over how to lift the lockdown is replete with trade-offs. Lifting it too soon  experts said  could reignite the contagion and force a new lockdown  which they said would shatter the confidence of businesses. But leaving it in place for too long could force many companies into insolvency and cause lasting damage. Although the government put off the decision until next week  its hand has effectively been forced. Scotland’s first minister  Nicola Sturgeon  said on Thursday that the lockdown there was likely to continue “for some weeks to come ” with no prospect of the measures being lifted in the coming days. The authorities in Wales made it clear they felt the same way. That reflected their worries that  without a clear pledge to continue the restrictions  Britons would take them less seriously over the Easter holiday weekend. But while there was a consensus that it was too soon to end the lockdown  there were growing calls for the government to clarify its approach. Keir Starmer  the new leader of the opposition Labour Party  called on the government to publish its exit strategy  saying on Twitter: “I’m not calling for precise timings  but the strategy. This is incredibly difficult on people and we need to know that plans are in place  and what they are.” There are at least four possible outcomes  said Devi Sridhar  the director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. They range from a coordinated global effort to close borders  which she said was highly unlikely  to intensive testing and contact tracing for people infected  which is more realistic. “If we can actually test people and quarantine those who are carrying the virus  we could relax it for everyone else ” Dr. Sridhar said. “We could keep that person and their family home for two weeks.” But the success of that approach would hinge on Britain vastly increasing its capacity for testing. The health secretary  Matt Hancock  set an ambitious target of carrying out 100 000 tests a day by the end of April. Britain  which got a slow start on testing  has fallen far short of those numbers. Even within parts of the government  there appeared to be confusion about the duration of the lockdown. Employees responsible for processing passport applications were asked to return to work next week. The deputy scientific adviser at the Home Office  Rupert Shute  said people were no more at risk in the workplace than at home or at the supermarket  according to a transcript of a conference call obtained by the BBC. Mr. Shute also referred indirectly to “herd immunity” — a theory once advanced as part of the government’s strategy but now rarely mentioned. It holds that as many as four-fifths of the population will contract the virus and therefore develop natural immunity against it. “We are working on the assessment that 80 percent of us  if we haven’t already  will get the virus ” he said. “We cannot hide away from it forever.” On Thursday  however  the government’s chief scientific adviser  Sir Patrick Vallance  said that based on data from other countries  he believed that fewer than 10 percent of Britons had so far been infected. The pressure to reopen the economy is immense. According to Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research  the lockdown is triggering the largest contraction in economic activity since 1921. It projects that growth will decline by 5 percent in the first quarter of 2020  and by between 15 percent and 25 percent in the second quarter  if the restrictions continue. “It’s a balance ” Jonathan Portes  a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London  said of the decision. “You have to make sure that you have as much support for companies to keep them going.” “But there will come a time when it will be too long for them ” he added. “My instinct is that about three months is a plausible limit at which you start doing a lot of permanent damage.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/world/09virus-britain/merlin_171379212_d8ab82c7-1231-4cd8-a218-9b21b92770a9-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v3.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-stephen-castle/author-stephen-castle-thumbLarge.png

The dreary buildings of Macroyan Kohna  a neighborhood in Kabul  Afghanistan  in November.Credit... Supported by By David Zucchino Photographs by Kiana Hayeri KABUL  Afghanistan — The scars from four decades of war are etched into the boxy apartment towers known as Macroyan Kohna  a dreary neighborhood built by the Soviets in central Kabul a half-century ago as a testament to modernity. Like other parts of the Afghan capital  Macroyan Kohna has been pummeled by rockets  mortar shells and car bombs since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan began just over 40 years ago. But the leafy neighborhood of shrapnel-pocked apartments has been rebuilt and expanded several times over. Macroyan  a corruption of the Russian word for “micro-complex ” offers a micro-history of Afghanistan’s four decades of war. Built for pro-Soviet Afghan elites  Macroyan Kohna today is a worn but vibrant neighborhood of middle- and upper-class Afghans who have reinvented it as a shabby chic refuge. Yet among the original 1960s gray “Khrushchevka” buildings  emblems of violence are everywhere  some decades old and some as fresh as the latest car bomb. There is the modest grave of an Afghan girl named Nahid  who residents say leapt to her death from an apartment window to escape a rape attempt by mujahedeen gunmen in 1993. Her grave is an informal shrine  decorated with tattered flags and banners and marked by a faded gray headstone. Other makeshift graves around the complex were hastily dug in the early 1990s  when Macroyan Kohna was on the front lines of a brutal civil war between mujahedeen factions. Transporting the dead to a cemetery was perilous  so rocket attack victims were buried in gardens late at night. The graves remain  some studded with small tombstones and others left unmarked. They are part of the district’s landscape  like the rose gardens and the drooping laundry lines strung between buildings and trees  or the plaintive cries of vendors hawking yogurt and grilled ears of corn. There are also fresh shrapnel holes and shattered windows from a car bombing on Sept. 5  cited by President Trump as the reason he called off Afghan peace talks. An American soldier was among those killed nearby. “We’ve been scarred by war for all these years  with barely time to breathe ” said Faroq Abdullah  an engineer who first moved into Macroyan Kohna in 1975  and whose apartment windows were blown out by the Sept. 5 bombing. Mr. Abdullah  who is in his 70s  was granted his apartment by the Soviets  who had a strong presence in Afghanistan for many years before their 1979 military invasion. He had helped them install a central heating system — a rarity in Afghanistan — in 1968 in the first phase of Macroyan Kohna  or Old Macroyan. Like many longtime residents  Mr. Abdullah has lost and regained his apartment more than once. He said the Afghan government confiscated the flat just before the Soviet invasion  when Mr. Abdullah was imprisoned for a year for “anti-revolutionary activities.” The apartment was returned to him in 1981  he said. But it was looted by mujahedeen fighters in the early 1990s  when he and his family lived in the building’s basement to escape rocket attacks. Many apartments were also seized or looted during the Taliban regime  from 1996 to 2001  he said. Some became offices of the feared Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice  which doled out public beatings for women who lacked veils  among other punishments. Mr. Abdullah said he lived in dread that the Taliban would discover that he had worked for the Soviets — a crime punishable by jail or execution. Today  Mr. Abdullah’s apartment is nearly bereft of furniture. He said he sold most of it to pay to replace windows shattered by the September car bomb. Macroyan Kohna was jolted again on Nov. 24  when a bomb nearby killed an American worker for the United Nations. For a brief period in the 1980s  Soviet technicians and advisers lived in 25 or 30 apartments in Macroyan Kohna  said Viacheslav Nekrasov  who directs the Russian cultural center in Kabul. Mr. Nekrasov  65  who briefly lived in a flat there in 1982  said the first apartments were considered ultramodern and luxurious — “a special presentation project” to promote Soviet expertise. “A lot of rockets have hit Macroyan Kohna  but as you can see it is still standing strong ” Mr. Nekrasov said. “These are very solid homes.” Since 1984  a fourth-floor apartment in Block 8 has been occupied off and on by Rena Baum  a Russian who married an Afghan student she met at a university in St. Petersburg in 1974. Ms. Baum  a silver-haired woman with striking blue eyes  waged a successful six-year court battle to reclaim the flat after it was occupied by squatters while she visited Russia. She moved back into the flat in 2014 — the only Russian in Macroyan Kohna  she said. She works for the government-run Radio Afghanistan  translating news on the Russian-language service. She speaks fluent Dari  a version of Persian spoken in Afghanistan. Ms. Baum’s apartment block is hulking and charmless  and sometimes the electricity and water service fail. The flats are so small and dark that some Afghans call them “pigeon coops.” Ms. Baum said she missed the Macroyan Kohna of the old days  when it was home solely to government ministers and professors. “Now there are a lot of uneducated people — they’re friendly  but I don’t really get to know them ” she said. Wesal  72  a retired army officer who goes by one name  has seen the complex expand through five phases since his father bought a flat in 1968. The latest iteration is Fifth Macroyan  a cluster of 18-story apartment towers now under construction  featuring balconies and large windows on a flat lot populated by clucking chickens. Mr. Wesal said he reclaimed his father’s 1968 apartment after it was seized by mujahedeen fighters in the early 1990s. “Any memories I have of those days are dark and sad ” he said. He said he was old enough to remember a time when Afghanistan was at peace. “I’ve seen war and I’ve seen peace ” he said. “I prefer peace.” Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.

09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/northern-ireland-abortion.html, world europe, Technically Legal in Northern Ireland  Abortions Are Still Unobtainable, The rollout of services has been hung up by arguments over telemedicine abortions  amid suspicions the health minister is trying to stop the process any way he can., Supported by The rollout of services has been hung up by arguments over telemedicine abortions  amid suspicions the health minister is trying to stop the process any way he can. By Ceylan Yeginsu LONDON — A week after abortion was supposed to become freely available in Northern Ireland  women continue to be denied access to services and are instead enduring an eight-hour ferry ride to Liverpool  England  despite the coronavirus lockdown. The collapse of Northern Ireland’s devolved government in 2017 allowed the British Parliament to step in last year and overturn the region’s highly restrictive  158-year-old abortion laws  ruling that they were incompatible with the United Kingdom’s human rights commitments. But even though the new laws went into effect on March 31  the regional power-sharing government  restored in January  is locked in a debate about how to roll out the new services. Many people suspect that the health minister is slow-walking the process  hoping to stymie it altogether. Northern Ireland’s regional government is led by Sinn Fein  which supports the new abortion legislation  and the Democratic Unionist Party  which ardently opposes abortion in all cases. The rollout is being delayed by a divisive clash among party leaders regarding telemedicine abortions  recently introduced in the rest of Britain to allow a woman in the early stages of pregnancy to self-administer medication that induces an abortion after a remote consultation with a doctor. After a closed government meeting on the issue on Monday  Arlene Foster  the first minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the ultraconservative Democratic Unionist Party  said that a “full discussion” about the services was required. “The health minister will bring papers forward  and we will have discussions in relation to those papers ” Ms. Foster  who previously blocked legalizing abortion in the region  said Monday at a news conference. “I don’t think it’s any secret that I don’t believe that abortion on demand should be available in Northern Ireland ” she said. “I think it’s a very retrograde step for our society.” Michelle O’Neil  the deputy first minister and vice president of Sinn Fein  the main nationalist party  said she supported telemedicine abortions  referring to them as “compassionate  modern health care.” While the issue is hung up in debate  legal experts question why that should be delaying implementation of surgical or pill-induced abortions at clinics  which were supposed to become available up to 12 weeks of pregnancy after the law went into effect. Abortion is one of the most contentious political issues in Northern Ireland  and many commentators believe that the Department of Health is stalling the process out of ideological objections. The health minister  Robin Swann  has described himself as “pro-life.” The previous law permitted abortions only if the woman’s life was in danger. Even in the event of rape  incest or fetal abnormalities  women were required to carry their pregnancies to term  and anyone caught procuring an abortion could face life imprisonment. “We know that health professionals are ready to offer abortion services and that the Trusts have stated they are awaiting approval from the Department of Health ” said Fiona Bloomer  an abortion policy researcher at Ulster University  speaking of the hospital trusts of the National Health Service. “There is no other blockage to this apart from a decision by the minister of health ” Dr. Bloomer said. “As the D.O.H. has failed to provide any answers  the only conclusion we can draw is that this is a political decision  to stall implementation of the regulations.” The Department of Health said that an agreement to begin providing abortions had to be reviewed in light of the coronavirus outbreak. “The minister is currently considering this urgently ” the department said in a statement. “Given the significance and sensitivity of the issue  it will be a decision for the executive ” the statement said  referring to the devolved government of Northern Ireland. When asked why the coronavirus should delay the rollout of regular abortion services outside of telemedicine  the department did not respond. Between the political impasse in Northern Ireland and the coronavirus lockdown  women have been left with only one option to secure free abortion services. That is to travel to England on a ferry that takes eight hours each way. Abortions in the Republic of Ireland cost around $500. Yet  with hotels closed as a result of the coronavirus lockdown  women who travel to England from Northern Ireland for abortions have little choice but to travel immediately back. “Women are effectively being asked to make an eight-hour journey on a ferry while in the middle of a miscarriage in the middle of a pandemic  without any support ” Emma Campbell  co-chairwoman of the Northern Irish reproductive rights group Alliance for Choice  said in a telephone interview. Doctors for Choice  an alliance of independent medical professionals advocating for reproductive health services in Ireland  warned that vulnerable women would be hit hard by the restrictions and called their being forced to travel during the pandemic “cruel” and “inhumane.” “There is no reason these services cannot be established in Northern Ireland quickly  and refusing to do so risks unnecessary spread of the coronavirus  placing women and health care professionals in greater danger ” the group said in a statement. Between the coronavirus and the delay in rolling out the new law  women in Northern Ireland are finding it harder to access abortion services than they have been in 50 years  women’s rights activists say. “This whole experience has been terrifying ” said a single mother of three who has been seeking abortion medication in the city of Derry in Northern Ireland. “How am I expected to travel when my three children are home all day  and we are all supposed to be isolating from our extended families and staying at home to protect ourselves?” The woman  who did not provide her name to protect her privacy  said a social worker had offered to send her the pills and give her instructions and support over the phone. But she said the idea of administering her own abortion scared her. “I just want to speak to a doctor and be safe ” she said. “I’m still trying to decide what to do  but I think in the end I will have no choice but to do it by myself.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

Roberts Jr. with choices that will invariably be seen as political., Supported by The question confronts Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. with choices that will invariably be seen as political. By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court  never the most transparent of institutions  has all but vanished. It still issues decisions  like the one on Monday that refused to extend absentee voting in Tuesday’s elections in Wisconsin. But the justices have stopped doing the most public part of their job  hearing arguments  and the courthouse is closed to the public. The last 20 arguments of the term  which had been scheduled for March and April  have been postponed indefinitely. That has left major cases in limbo  notably ones on subpoenas from prosecutors and Congress for President Trump’s financial records  which had been scheduled to be heard on March 31. Those cases were going to be a test of the independence of the court even before the coronavirus crisis complicated matters. While the president’s free-form coronavirus briefings make him a constant presence in the nation’s consciousness  the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has in important ways receded from view. Very little is known about how the justices are conducting their work in the midst of the pandemic or how they plan to proceed. This presents the chief justice with a fresh set of challenges in what has already been a difficult year  and it is only April. He has said that he and his colleagues “don’t work as Democrats or Republicans ” but demonstrating that has required him to engage in a balancing act. In January  he presided over the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump  with whom he has had a testy relationship  even as important cases concerning the president’s policies and business affairs were pending before the court. In February  he declined to comment when Mr. Trump criticized Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor  two liberal members of the court  and called on them to recuse themselves from all cases involving him. In March  though  the chief justice did respond to remarks by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  attacking Mr. Trump’s two appointees to the court  Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch. And on Monday  he joined the court’s other Republican appointees in a closely divided decision that delivered a victory to Wisconsin Republicans. Chief Justice Roberts’s next challenge will be how to handle the postponed arguments. Rescheduling most of them to the fall would seem harmless. The nation can afford to wait a few months to hear  for instance  whether Booking.com can trademark its name. But deciding whether Mr. Trump’s accountants and bankers must turn over his tax returns and other financial records is more urgent. Deferring decisions on those cases until after the presidential election would strike many as a partisan act meant to aid Mr. Trump. The court will not take that step lightly. The chief justice ordinarily takes the leading role in scheduling arguments. In the current crisis  though  the question of what to do about the postponed cases will almost certainly be resolved by the full court  either by consensus or by majority vote. And it will be mindful of earlier cases in which it ruled promptly and unanimously required Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton to provide evidence. The Nixon case led to his resignation in the face of mounting calls for his impeachment. The Clinton case led to Mr. Clinton’s impeachment  though he survived a Senate vote on his removal. The other pressing case on the court’s docket concerns whether members of the Electoral College may cast their votes for presidential candidates other than the ones they had pledged to support. A decision by June would allow the court to act without knowing which candidate in the 2020 election could benefit from its ruling. A decision after the election itself  by contrast  would again raise the specter of partisanship. That such a dispute might arise is not fanciful: The votes of only 10 “faithless electors” could have changed the outcomes in five of the previous 58 presidential elections. In the 2000 election  for instance  George W. Bush beat Al Gore by five electoral votes. The court has another blockbuster on the horizon  a challenge to President Barack Obama’s health care law. But the justices took their time in agreeing to hear the case  ensuring that it would not be argued until the fall. When the justices take the bench  their questions reflect intense preparation  mastery of the record and sheer brainy competence that is not always apparent in the other branches. Without oral arguments  the court’s work can feel thin and haphazard. But the prospect of holding arguments at the courthouse itself anytime soon seems extremely remote in light of the health crisis and the ages of the justices. Justice Ginsburg is 87  and Justice Stephen G. Breyer is 81. Four other members of the court — Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor  Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — are 65 or older. Justice Ginsburg has continued to come to the largely empty courthouse — to work out with her trainer. “The court has set aside the limited private space next to its health facility for Justice Ginsburg to exercise ” according to the court’s spokeswoman  Kathleen Arberg. “Her doctors share her view that the training sessions are essential to her well-being. The space is being used exclusively by the justice. No other justices are using the space  and the employee gym is closed to all users.” Justice Breyer has been working from his home in Cambridge  Mass.  consulting with his law clerks by phone and email  and doing his part in the kitchen. Last week  he shared his recipe for Italian pot roast with The Wall Street Journal. In a cryptic news release last week  the court gave no indication about whether it would decide the cases it has postponed by the end of June  when its term ordinarily ends. It has four basic alternatives to hearing arguments at the courthouse in the next couple of months: deferring them to the next term  which starts in October; truncating the justices’ long summer break to allow for arguments in July  August or September; deciding cases based solely on written submissions; and using the modern technology familiar to every American working from home. In earlier public health crises  the court simply put things off. It postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic  a recent news release from the court said. “The court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 ” the release said  “in response to yellow fever outbreaks.” Other courts are experimenting  with considerable success  with conducting oral arguments online while allowing the public to watch or listen. But the Supreme Court has long been allergic to full public access to its arguments. It has never allowed camera coverage or live audio. On 27 occasions over the last two decades  it has released same-day audio. But its usual practice is to release transcripts within hours but audio only at the end of the week. In the best of times  then  seeing a Supreme Court argument requires showing up in person. As an ambitious series of articles in Scotusblog has been documenting  as few as 50 seats are made available to the public in major cases  and citizens can wait for days in brutal weather for a chance to see their government at work. Still  the prospect of the court allowing live remote access to its arguments even in the midst of a pandemic seems unlikely  if only because it would be hard to retreat once the crisis has passed. The justices have not heard arguments since March 4  when they considered a challenge to a Louisiana law that could leave the state with a single abortion clinic. Eight days later  the courthouse was closed to the public. Four days after that  the court postponed two weeks of arguments. In addition to the abortion case  the court’s most significant encounter with the subject since Justice Kavanaugh replaced the more moderate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in 2018  the court will also rule on two other blockbusters  argued in the fall  in the coming months. In one  it will decide whether a landmark civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from employment discrimination. In the other  it will rule on whether Mr. Trump may shut down a program that protects young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation and allows them to work. In past years  those decisions would have been announced from the bench in the grand courtroom by the justices who wrote the majority opinions  often followed by an impassioned dissent. That ceremony is lost now  replaced by a visit to the court’s website around 9:58 a.m.  followed by a couple of minutes of clicking the refresh button. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/us/politics/08dc-scotus/08dc-scotus-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v3.png 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/baltimore-surveillance-planes-aclu.html, us, Baltimore Hopes Surveillance Planes Lower Crime  but Residents Fear Abuse, The A.C.L.U. has challenged a six-month trial program endorsed by the police chief in a city with one of the highest murder rates in the nation., Supported by The A.C.L.U. has challenged a six-month trial program endorsed by the police chief in a city with one of the highest murder rates in the nation. By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs Baltimore has been divided for years by the Police Department’s desire to record residents from surveillance planes  a drastic proposal to reduce crime in a city where the murder rate remains stubbornly high and where the police have repeatedly abused their power. On Thursday  a judge temporarily blocked the planes from flying reconnaissance missions after a community think tank and two Baltimore residents challenged the surveillance program  which was approved last week. The lawsuit argues that the planes  which were about to begin a six-month trial run  would violate the residents’ constitutional rights to not be searched without cause and to freely associate with others. Baltimore police officials have stressed that the surveillance footage would be used only after a serious crime has been reported — not to track vehicles or people during a police chase — and that the results of the trial run would be reviewed rigorously. The mayor supports the program  and one poll showed broad support among residents. But many others remain skeptical of the eyes-in-the-sky approach  worrying it will infringe on their rights and be used more broadly than in the narrow set of crimes officials have identified. “What this technology basically gives the Baltimore Police Department the permission to do is like if a police officer followed you from sunup to sundown ” Erricka Bridgeford  a prominent activist in Baltimore and one of the plaintiffs  said in an interview. She and the other plaintiffs are being represented by lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union in their suit against the Police Department and its commissioner. Richard D. Bennett  a federal judge in Maryland  said in his order that the planes could not collect any footage until he had ruled on the plaintiffs’ request that he stop the program while he considers its legality. In 2016  the Police Department began working with Persistent Surveillance Systems to fly a Cessna plane over the city  a partnership hidden from the public and many city officials. The police chief at the time acknowledged that he did not brief the mayor about the program before it was revealed in an article by Bloomberg Businessweek. The program was halted soon after  but a vigorous effort to bring it back — including by a billionaire couple in Texas that has pledged to cover the cost — proved successful this month. The $3.69 million trial run would involve pilots flying three planes for at least 40 hours per week  according to a copy of the Police Department’s request for approval  which was posted online by a city councilman. The planes’ surveillance cameras would capture 32 square miles — or about 40 percent of the city — every second  according to the request. Michael S. Harrison  the police commissioner  has emphasized that the program is a trial and that he would support its continuation only if it successfully reduces crime. “We will be the first American city to use this technology in an attempt to solve and deter violent crime ” Commissioner Harrison said in December  when he threw his support behind the trial. Even as its population has decreased  Baltimore has seen a rise in homicides since 2015  when Freddie Gray died of injuries he sustained in police custody  leading to unrest throughout the city. At least 348 people were killed in 2019  the most in more than 25 years and more than in New York City  which has 13 times the population. The intractable murder rate has made police officials desperate for anything that can help reduce crime  including the surveillance planes  which many people refer to as spy planes. Commissioner Harrison has said that the resolution of the surveillance would be one pixel per person or vehicle  which officials say will make it impossible to identify a person or their race. But many residents  and the A.C.L.U.  argue that recording wide swaths of the city over long periods of time makes nearly anyone identifiable  particularly in conjunction with the many surveillance cameras on the ground. “All you need to do is roll back the tape to where someone comes out of the house in the morning or roll it forward to where they go back in the house at night ” said Brett Max Kaufman  one of the lead lawyers on the lawsuit. Ms. Bridgeford  the community activist  said she worried that the high tensions surrounding the program would only hurt police officers’ relationship with the community. Despite operating under a consent decree with the Justice Department  the Police Department’s members have continued to abuse citizens in high-profile incidents. “This kind of technology will undermine the kind of work officers are doing on the ground in neighborhoods ” said Ms. Bridgeford  who runs cease-fire events throughout the city. “People are absolutely not going to want to talk to them when they know planes are flying in the sky all day.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/us/09SPYPLANE/merlin_171306639_08a6b04e-73bc-4e75-b4d2-912b54bed710-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/arts/dance/anne-bass-78-arts-patron-and-peerless-gardener-dies.html, arts dance, Anne Bass  78  Arts Patron and Peerless Gardener  Dies, A leading philanthropist  she championed  without fanfare  the New York City Ballet and numerous art museums. She also loved her dahlias., Supported by A leading philanthropist  she championed  without fanfare  the New York City Ballet and numerous art museums. She also loved her dahlias. By Deborah Solomon Anne Hendricks Bass  the arts patron who helped raise the profile of ballet in the United States  harking back to an era when art was viewed as a vehicle for beauty and moral uplift  died on April 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 78. Julian Lethbridge  her longtime partner  said the cause was ovarian cancer. Ms. Bass was well-established in Fort Worth before she made her name in New York City  and her style as a patron was entirely her own. In contrast to boastful Texans with their McRanches or status-hungry New Yorkers in pursuit of donor plaques  Ms. Bass was reticent and aloof. Slender with pale blue eyes  she armored herself with an apparent indifference to the less gracious aspects of life  which included her much-publicized divorce from the oilman Sid Bass in the 1980s. She saved her energy for her interests  especially gardening and architecture  which she pursed with a seriousness that was almost alarming to those who knew her. “Anne was a research junkie ” said Heather Watts  a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet and one of Ms. Bass’s closest friends. “If I told her I liked dahlias  I’d receive articles and books about dahlias.” When Ms. Bass spoke of her “renovation” projects  she didn’t mean a new stove and kitchen cabinets. Rather  she was consumed by the restoration of sprawling swaths of land  in both New England and in the Caribbean  drawn to a vision of a pristine naturalness that predated the arrival of cars and vacationers. Her country estate in northwest Connecticut  in Kent  fans out to cover about 1 000 acres. In addition to the obligatory emerald pastures and winding fieldstone walls  the estate embraces multiple gardens  a working farm and a herd of 97 Randall cows that evoke the bovine ghosts of centuries past. “We have some of her cows on our property  and they’re eating the grass right now ” Agnes Gund  her neighbor in South Kent and fellow philanthropist  said this week. “I admired Anne very much  especially what she did for the land.” Her gardens  according to her family  are to be preserved  probably as some kind of land conservancy. “Nothing will be sold ” Mr. Lethbridge said  “neither in Connecticut  nor Nevis or Texas.” In the philanthropic world  Ms. Bass remained best-known as a champion of City Ballet and its school  where she was a board member from 1980 to 2005. She adored George Balanchine  the brilliantly inventive choreographer who co-founded the ballet  and she felt that the company  if not all of existence  declined in quality after he left. Ms. Bass herself danced up until the end of her life. Three times a week  she put on black leotard and tights and took a 90-minute morning class in advanced ballet. Her instructor for decades  the dance master Wilhelm Burmann  died only two days before her. Anne Hyatt Hendricks was born on Oct. 19  1941  in Indianapolis  the oldest of four children. Her father  John Wesley Hendricks  was a surgeon and urologist. Her mother  Jean (Brown) Hendricks  was an avid sportswoman whose shelves were lined with golf trophies. Educated at Vassar College like her mother  she majored in Italian literature. She married Mr. Bass  her college sweetheart and billionaire heir to a Texas oil fortune  in 1965. As a young wife with two young daughters and living in Fort Worth  she and Mr. Bass  enamored of modernist architecture  commissioned a house from Paul Rudolph  an avatar of Brutalist design. But in contrast to his signature stacks of concrete blocks  the Bass house is widely regarded as a masterpiece of lightness — an airy  all-white edifice with calming horizontal planes jutting out over the Texas hills. The grounds were designed by Russell Page  the British gardener responsible for landscaping the Frick Museum in New York. The Bass marriage ended abruptly in 1986  when Mr. Bass left his wife for the socialite Mercedes Kellogg. The tabloids reveled in every detail of the romance  which reportedly began at a formal ball when Ms. Kellogg threw a dinner roll across the room at Mr. Bass. The divorce  in 1988  left Ms. Bass with a settlement estimated at $200 million. She was able to hold onto the house in Fort Worth  as well as a Manhattan pied-à-terre on Fifth Avenue and its lofty contents: paintings by Monet and Mark Rothko  and an original bronze cast of Degas’s “Little 14-Year-Old Dancer.” In subsequent years  Ms. Bass became one of New York’s most respected philanthropists  supporting  in large but unflashy ways  the New York Botanical Garden  the Museum of Modern Art and  especially  the New York Public Library and its Jerome Robbins Dance Division  which is housed at Lincoln Center and holds the largest archive on the history of dance in the world. Ms. Bass never remarried. She met Mr. Lethbridge  an accomplished artist six years her junior  in 1993. He specializes in large-scale abstract paintings that feel rooted in nature  variously evoking winter tree branches  churning waves or rosy dawns. In addition to Mr. Lethbridge  Ms. Bass is survived by two daughters  Hyatt Bass  a novelist  and Samantha Bass  a photographer. As a board member  Ms. Bass was sometimes described as brusque and implacable. In 1987  as a longtime trustee of the Fort Worth Art Museum  she was blamed for a high institutional turnover: Within a decade  three directors and an interim director had arrived and departed in short order. Even those who admired her exacting standards could be bothered by “the Bass body count ” as Texas Monthly put it  referring to the arts administrators who had failed to cut it in her eyes. But to many her stubbornness came to seem like inspired foresight in regard to Peter Martins  the former head of City Ballet and its school. He left his position in 2018 amid accusations of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. As early as 2005  Ms. Bass had sounded a warning  resigning from the school’s board and charging Mr. Martins  in a private letter  with gross misconduct. More specifically  she accused Mr. Martins of inflicting “cruel and excessive punishment” on a student whom he had expelled just a few weeks before graduation. The student  Sokvannara Sar  was a Cambodian prodigy whom Ms. Bass had brought to the New York five years earlier and sponsored at the School of American Ballet. Mr. Martins  she said  had made the student “an innocent and disposable casualty of boardroom politics in which he played no part.” Mr. Martins has not publicly responded to the allegations. In the end  Mr. Sar graduated on schedule after a two-week expulsion. He achieved fame in 2010  when Ms. Bass captured their friendship in “Dancing Across Borders ” an upbeat documentary that marked her directorial debut. The film tracks Mr. Sar’s unlikely journey to the United States from his native Siem Reap  where  in poverty  he had wandered the streets without shoes. Ms. Bass met him in 2000  at the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia  where she saw him dance with a folk group and was awed by his charismatic stage presence. Four months later  Mr. Sar  a 16-year-old who spoke no English  arrived in New York  a newcomer to ballet. Now 36  Mr. Sar is a soloist with the Carolina Ballet in Raleigh  N.C. Speaking by phone  he said that he had last spent extended time with Ms. Bass three years ago  when he recuperated from foot surgery on her Connecticut estate. He often awoke to find gardening books stacked on the table beside his bed. Mr. Sar said that Ms. Bass had seemed to enjoy nothing more than solitude. “Anne loved to be just by herself  in her boots ” he said  “picking the weeds out of the garden.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/books/07Bass1/merlin_34030383_1d4a7a47-1f5f-47b8-a5d3-b057ca4a8b59-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/ira-einhorn-dead.html, us, Ira Einhorn  Counterculture Guru and Murderer  Dies in Prison at 79, He preached peace  love and environmentalism. Then he killed his girlfriend  stuffed her body in a steamer trunk and fled to Europe., Supported by He preached peace  love and environmentalism. Then he killed his girlfriend  stuffed her body in a steamer trunk and fled to Europe. By Katharine Q. Seelye Ira Einhorn was the darling of Philadelphia’s counterculture in the 1960s and ’70s. A charismatic and flamboyant personality  he preached peace  love and environmentalism  and became a sought-after liaison in helping the city’s civic establishment grasp the upheavals in society. Then his former girlfriend  Holly Maddux  who had left him  disappeared. Almost a year and a half later  the police found her mummified remains in a steamer trunk in his apartment. He was charged in 1979 with her murder. But before his pretrial hearing  he fled to Europe  eventually marrying a wealthy Swedish heiress  Annika Flodin  and settling down in a converted windmill in France. More than two decades later  after lengthy and convoluted extradition negotiations  in which he became a human rights cause célèbre in France  he was sent back to Philadelphia to stand trial. A jury quickly convicted him and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Mr. Einhorn had been in prison for nearly 18 years when he died on April 3 in the State Correctional Institution Laurel Highlands in southwestern Pennsylvania. He was 79. The Somerset County coroner  Wally Miller  said in a phone interview that Mr. Einhorn died of longstanding cardiac problems  unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. His death brought an end to a bizarre melodrama that troubled Philadelphians for decades and drew worldwide attention. “The chapter is finally  for real  closed ” Elizabeth Hall  one of Ms. Maddux’s sisters  told The Philadelphia Inquirer last week. “I think a lot of people in Philadelphia were waiting to hear” that he had died  she said. “He became part of the city’s consciousness in an ugly way.” In 1972 he began a five-year relationship with Ms. Maddux  who was from Tyler  Texas  and had graduated from nearby Bryn Mawr College. Her family never liked him  considering him a bully  and in 1977 she left him and moved to New York. He was furious and demanded that she come back to Philadelphia to retrieve her belongings  saying he would throw them into the street if she didn’t. She came back. And then she vanished. She was 30. Mr. Einhorn denied any involvement in her disappearance  saying she had gone out to the local co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts and had never returned. It was a measure of his ability to make important connections that after he was charged with murder  his lawyer was Arlen Specter  the city’s former district attorney who was then in private practice and who went on to become a United States senator. Mr. Specter managed to get Mr. Einhorn’s bail reduced to $40 000. To be released from custody  Mr. Einhorn had to put up only 10 percent  or $4 000. It was paid by a Canadian socialite  one of several well-off people who supported him financially and who doubted he could have been involved in murder. Ira Samuel Einhorn was born on May 15  1940  in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1961 with a major in English. A big burly man with a full beard and electric blue eyes  he was an early avatar of the counterculture steeped in consciousness-raising  ecological awareness and illicit psychedelic drugs. He dropped acid as early as 1958 and later started a rescue service for people in the throes of bad trips. He also taught a series of free courses  including “Analogues to the LSD Experience.” The Village Voice called him “indisputably Philadelphia’s head hippie” and the city’s “number one freak.” He attracted a wide range of friends  from the Yippies Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman to corporate executives and civic do-gooders. “Ira waxed eloquent about what was happening in the world ” Sam Katz  a former mayoral candidate and Philadelphia entrepreneur  said in a phone interview. “It was the age of Aquarius and the Vietnam War and the generation gap  and he was articulate and dynamic and very approachable ” Mr. Katz said. Mr. Einhorn became a bridge between the anti-establishment and the establishment  he said  often speaking at civic events. But his darker side and a monumental ego were emerging  most noticeably during the first Earth Day celebration in 1970  when 20 million people across the country gathered to draw attention to environmental problems. As two environmental activists later wrote in an op-ed in The Inquirer  Mr. Einhorn had made himself unwelcome at organizational meetings in advance of Earth Day  and then  at the actual event  he “grabbed the microphone and refused to give up the podium for 30 minutes  thinking he would get some free television publicity.” He later falsely claimed to have been a founder of Earth Day  a title generally accorded to Senator Gaylord Nelson  a Wisconsin Democrat. Mr. Einhorn was domineering with women and could become violent if he was rejected. The news media reported that at one point he strangled a woman until she was unconscious; at another  he hit a woman over the head with a bottle. After Ms. Maddux vanished  he carried on as before. He continued to give speeches  and in 1978 spent a semester at the Institute of Politics at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Frustrated at the lack of progress in finding their daughter  the Maddux family hired a private investigator. By then  neighbors reported a stench coming from Mr. Einhorn’s apartment and a dark liquid leaking into the apartment below. When the police searched the apartment in 1979  they found Ms. Maddux’s decomposed body in a trunk in a closet. Her skull had been fractured in at least six places by a blunt object. A murder trial for Mr. Einhorn had been set for 1981 when he fled. The Philadelphia district attorney decided to try him in 1993 anyway  in absentia  a rare proceeding but one that the city felt might bring the case to a close. The jury quickly found him guilty  and the judge sentenced him to life without parole. The case continued to capture the public’s imagination. Mr. Einhorn had labeled himself “the unicorn ” the translation of his name in German.  and he became the subject of a 1988 book by Steven Levy called “The Unicorn’s Secret: A Murder in the Age of Aquarius.” Investigators  spurred on by Ms. Maddux’s family  continued the search for Mr. Einhorn. In 1997 they found him in a farmhouse in southwest France. As negotiations over his extradition dragged on for four years  NBC produced a mini-series in 1999 called “The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer.” He was finally sent back to Philadelphia in 2001. As a condition for his extradition  he was granted a second trial  during which he took the stand. He said that the C.I.A. had killed Ms. Maddux and planted her body in his apartment in an attempt to frame him because he knew too much about military research into the paranormal. He was found guilty and again sentenced to life in prison without parole. The parting thoughts of those in the courtroom were not kind. A juror said that Mr. Einhorn had a God complex. The presiding judge called him “an intellectual dilettante” who preyed on people. The district attorney  Lynne Abraham  said  “Metaphorically speaking  Ira Einhorn and his Virgo moon are toast.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/obituaries/07Einhorn1/07Einhorn1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/reader-center/author-katharine-q-seelye/author-katharine-q-seelye-thumbLarge.png 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/edward-feightner-dead.html, us, Edward Feightner  Test Pilot and World War II Ace  Dies at 100, Admiral Feightner played a leading role in the development of the Navy’s postwar jets., Supported by Admiral Feightner played a leading role in the development of the Navy’s postwar jets. By Richard Goldstein Rear Adm. Edward L. Feightner  a Navy air ace of World War II who shot down nine Japanese planes while flying propeller-driven fighters  then played a prominent role in the testing and development of postwar Navy jets  died on Wednesday in Coeur d’Alene  Idaho. He was 100. His death  at a senior living facility  was confirmed by his nephew Jim McBride  with whom he had been living in Coeur d’Alene. In his 34 years of Navy service  as a combat pilot in the Pacific  an instructor and a test pilot  Admiral Feightner flew more than 100 types of planes. While he was a junior Navy officer  he twice shot down three Japanese planes on a single day and took part in battles in the Solomon Islands  the Caroline Islands  the Marianas and the Philippines. In the late 1940s  he became one of the early test pilots at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. He flew or analyzed the systems for fighters  transports  helicopters and just about any other type of aircraft envisioned by the Navy. He became the head of the Navy’s fighter design program and was twice awarded the Legion of Merit for his testing and administrative activities. He received four Distinguished Flying Crosses for his combat exploits. In the early 1950s  Admiral Feightner was a member of the Navy’s Blue Angels  whose close-formation flying and acrobatics thrilled crowds at air shows. Edward Lewis Feightner was born in Lima  Ohio  on Oct. 14  1919  one of four children of Amos Feightner  a tool and die maker for a steam locomotive company  and Mary (Roth) Feightner  a homemaker. Edward grew up in nearby Elida  where his extended family had dairy farms. While he was attending Findlay College (now the University of Findlay) in Ohio in the late 1930s  a pilot for an Ohio oil company who ran a nearby airport gave him a ride in a Ford Tri-Motor  a popular passenger and transport plane of the time  and let him take the controls for a few hours. Fascinated by flight  he joined the civilian pilot training program  which was creating a pool of prospective military pilots as war loomed. He received his private pilot’s license in 1940. One day in April 1941  he was at the airport near the Findlay campus with a fellow flight student when he was impressed by a scene that sold him on naval aviation. “I had already signed up for the Army Air Corps  and they had a little wait before we could go in ” Admiral Feightner recalled in an interview for the Virginia Military Institute in 2005. “One day an airplane landed at the airport and a guy walked into the hangar wearing Navy whites  and a yellow convertible comes screeching around the hangar and a blonde jumps out and gives him a big smooch  and off they went.” The young men’s flight instructor  seeing how captivated they were  suggested that they check out a Navy air training center in Michigan. “We went up there and found out what the Navy stuff was all about and they said  ‘Hey  we’ll take you this afternoon ’” Admiral Feightner said. “So we signed up.” He entered active duty after graduating from Findlay in 1941  received his wings in April 1942 and was assigned to a squadron based in Hawaii and commanded by the fighter pilot Butch O’Hare  a Medal of Honor recipient and one of America’s early war heroes. Lieutenant Commander O’Hare nicknamed him Whitey as a little joke  since he turned deep red instead of tanning in the Hawaiian sun. He was known as Whitey Feightner thereafter. (Butch O’Hare was killed in action in 1943. Chicago’s international airport is named for him.) Admiral Feightner was credited with his first “kill” when he shot down a Japanese dive bomber off the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942. He downed three torpedo bombers off Rennell Island on Jan. 30  1943  and became an ace (a pilot with at least five kills) when he shot down a Zero fighter off the Palau island chain in March 1944. He shot down another Zero off Truk in April 1944 and downed three Zeros off Formosa (now Taiwan) on Oct. 12  1944. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1970 and retired four years later  becoming a corporate consultant to the Navy. His wife  Violet (Volz) Feightner  died in 2015. They had no children. His three sisters died before him. Admiral Feightner had many close calls (though never a crash) both in combat and as a test pilot. In one  he came under fire on a reconnaissance flight over the Mariana Islands in June 1944  returning to his carrier with more than 170 shrapnel holes in his Hellcat fighter. In another  in 1951  while testing a Cutlass fighter  he made a hard landing on the deck of the carrier Midway off the Virginia coast  causing the fuselage to crack just behind the cockpit. “It sounded like someone had taken a board and slapped it down vertically on the wing ” he was quoted as saying by Peter B. Mersky in “Whitey: The Story of Rear Admiral E.L. Feightner  a Navy Fighter Ace” (2014). “The crack was wide enough so that you could see through it.” “If you can’t stay calm and focused in a crisis  you have no business being a fighter pilot ” Admiral Feightner told Investor’s Business Daily in 2015. “It’s a matter of life and death  not only for you but those you’re defending.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/obituaries/10Feightner2/03Feightner2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
09/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/opinion/covid-anxiety.html, opinion, The Pandemic of Fear and Agony, Readers open up about their mental states., Supported by Readers open up about their mental states. By David Brooks Opinion Columnist Dear Friends  Last week I asked you to tell me about your mental health — how you are faring in this hard time. I don’t know what I expected; maybe some jaunty stories about families pulling together in a crisis. What you sent gutted me. There have been over 5 000 replies so far  and while many people are hanging in there  there is also a river of woe running through the world — a significant portion of our friends and neighbors are in agony. A college student in State College  Pa.  wrote that at first the lockdown seemed like a lark — a chance to get out of certain obligations. But “now almost a month into staying here  I’ve been gripped by a deep depression. My appetite is very low. I’m sleeping far too much to feel as lethargic as I do. “My future  which seemed so bright a few months ago as I anticipated graduating in May  now seems bleak and hopeless: How will I find a job with the economy tanking? How will I pay hundreds of dollars per month when my loan bills kick in during August?” A college junior from Vienna  Va.  is going through the same thing. His career hopes now seem dashed. “I’ve spent days crying alone and feeling helpless as I’ve been stuck at my parent’s house and I find myself difficult to be around even as I don’t want to be.” Senior citizens are especially hard hit  particularly the widows and widowers. For many  it’s the painful sense of missing their grandkids  the precarity of living with a disease that could kill them at any time. For others  it’s the wrenching loneliness. “The combination of isolation and stress is having compounded impact. I am 65  and a single woman with no nearby family. My surviving sibling lives several hours away. Six months ago  my older brother died (I am the youngest). My neighbors are not very friendly  and not once has anyone asked if I needed anything. … I cry a lot  which is my new norm. … So to sum it up  I’m feeling totally alone in this crisis and hopeless.” A woman from Fresno wrote  “I am normally a very positive person  outgoing  happy  energetic. Definitely a glass half-full. However  lately I cannot get through a day without tears  often sobs. I am terrified for myself and my family and everyone in the world. All the things I love to do  I’m now afraid to do. … “The anxiety is also very challenging. I have not been able to eat much. I have experienced anorexia previously during times of stress — divorce  death  etc. I’ve lost 8.5 pounds in the past month. That might not sound like much  but I’m tiny and it’s 8 percent of my body weight.” Then there are those already suffering with mental health issues. People with anxiety disorders wrote in to say that they were paralyzed by the possibility that they hadn’t washed their hands well enough  that they hadn’t disinfected enough and that they would cause their own death. “I’m struggling. I returned to my family’s home earliest this year ” one woman explained. “I’ve placed myself back at the center of a highly dysfunctional household — generations of trauma  sexual abuse  alcoholism  depression and anxiety.” Another person wrote that there was no way to distract yourself from your unhappiness now. Indeed  you are hogtied to your unhappiness. One reader said this pandemic was causing “invisible stress” — a pervasive  ever-shifting  hard-to-define anxiety. Many people are experiencing shortness of breath  tightness in the chest  exhaustion. One man from Placitas  N.M.  said he used to have five things he wanted to accomplish in a day  but now it’s down to two — maybe baking bread or planting a small garden. A woman from Pennsylvania said the anxiety leaves her mentally drained  more irritable  unable to focus. “I think of it like having a few large apps on my phone that are running and draining the battery  even when I’m not using them ” she said. Some people are active for days  frantically cleaning the house  and then one day they just shut down and cry. A person from Denver is worn down by being so suspicious of others and asked  “Why am I suddenly afraid of the mail carrier or the food delivery?” There’s a heroism in the vulnerability you display in these letters  a courageous willingness to share your fears. You can read several more of them here  and you’ll see that spiritual growth pulses through the paragraphs. An atheist wrote that he prays daily  though he doesn’t know to whom. Many people are reading Viktor Frankl. “I am looking at this as a type of monastic retreat. I am hoping that we come out of this crisis as a nation with a renewed sense of perspective  a new sense of our dependence on each other.” I’m reminded that this is a time to practice aggressive friendship with each other — to be the one who seeks out the lonely and the troubled. It’s also true that character is formed in times like this. People see deeper into themselves  bravely learn what their pain is teaching them  and become wiser and softer as a result.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/opinion/coronavirus-paramedics-emt.html, opinion, New York’s Paramedics  on the Front Lines and Forgotten, Give these critical emergency workers the equipment they need and the pay they deserve., Supported by Give these critical emergency workers the equipment they need and the pay they deserve. By Mara Gay Ms. Gay is a member of the editorial board Christell Cadet  a New York Fire Department paramedic  loves her job. I know because she told me. When I asked her last year what it was like to be on the ambulance  she spoke of the thrill of saving a life  of racing toward danger to help when others were running away. Ms. Cadet has been on a ventilator for the better part of a month  sick with the coronavirus and fighting for her life. She is 34 years old. “I just want people to know that she’s a very beautiful person. She has a good heart ” her mother  Jessy Cadet  told me by phone this week. “She’s always ready to help anybody  everybody  everywhere.” Much attention in this terrible pandemic is being focused on the country’s hospitals  and rightly so. But the battle is also being fought by the nation’s front-line emergency medical workers  paramedics and E.M.T.s. These skilled professionals are responding to a deluge of calls  risking their lives to aid millions of sick Americans. In New York City  where the Fire Department’s roughly 4 400 emergency medical workers are already underpaid and overworked  the pandemic is taking an enormous toll. They are responding to 6 000 to 7 000 calls a day; in normal times  the average is about 4 000. Nearly a quarter of these workers are on sick leave  according to Fire Department officials. At least three are in critical condition with coronavirus symptoms. One question amid the shortage is how many face masks in the city’s stockpile are actually making it to the E.M.T.s  paramedics and other city workers who are most at risk. City officials declined to respond to repeated inquiries about how the masks and other critical medical supplies were being distributed across city agencies. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Tuesday that the F.D.N.Y. commissioner  Daniel Nigro  had assured him the department had the supplies it needed. The mayor said the department was meeting a “crisis standard” of personal protective equipment held as acceptable by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Anything more they need  they will get ” Mr. de Blasio said. E.M.S. workers tell a different story. In interviews  they said some stations started running out of N95 masks weeks ago. They said they have been forced to reuse masks  gowns and other protective gear. To request additional N95 masks  they said they must explain in writing how they used their previous supply. And they said there is little or no coronavirus testing available to them or their colleagues. “It’s scary  because you take a patient to the hospital and the nurses and the doctors are fully covered from their head to their toes ” said Elizabeth Bonilla  an F.D.N.Y. paramedic. “They have bootees  they have hairnets. A gown  two masks. We’re exposed.” It’s not just a New York problem. Bruce Evans  president-elect of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians  said some workers in the United States were using raincoats as protective gear. Bree Brown-Rosa  a paramedic with an F.D.N.Y. HazTac unit  which is trained to handle terrorist attacks and hazardous materials  said her unit doesn’t consistently have enough N95 masks to safely perform its job  even as she and her colleagues do their best to conserve them. The other day  Ms. Brown-Rosa walked into her E.M.S. station to find a pile of P-100 respirator masks  donated by the Home Depot. “Here I am  a HazTac paramedic in the best fire department in the world  and we have to take donations from local businesses to protect ourselves ” she said. “People need to be held accountable. Heads need to roll.” How did this happen in New York  a city with a world-class department justly celebrated for its heroic service during the Sept. 11 attacks? Emergency medical services have been an afterthought in New York for years. In much of the country  firefighters also serve as paramedics or E.M.T.s. But in New York  E.M.S. is a separate division within the Fire Department. Firefighters receive a base pay of about $85 000 after five years on the job  compared to about $65 000 for paramedics and $50 000 for E.M.T.s. The firefighting force is three-quarters white and about 99 percent male; more than half of E.M.S. workers are minorities  and more than a quarter are women  according to city data. Mr. de Blasio  now staring down a yawning budget hole  says it’s not the time for pay raises. “We want to take care of these workers and support them  of course have their backs  but this is a bigger issue in the labor dynamics of this city ” he told WNYC last Friday. “It’s not the time to  you know  make something up on the fly in the middle of a crisis. We’ll figure this out when we get through this crisis.” Remember that the next time you hear a siren. Tell that to Christell Cadet’s mother. The pay gap was wrong before the pandemic. It was bad public policy  making it difficult to attract and retain talent in the E.M.S. force. More than 1 500 E.M.T.s and paramedics have become firefighters since 2013  according to city officials  leaving E.M.S. units understaffed and employees working regular mandatory overtime shifts. Mr. de Blasio failed to strengthen the city’s E.M.S. service in recent years even as medical calls  rather than fires  came to make up more than 80 percent of the Fire Department’s work. Despite this  firefighters managed to rack up more than $340 million in overtime in fiscal year 2019  which ended last June. When it comes to political power  New York’s firefighters just have more juice. Paramedics and E.M.T.s  like firefighters and police officers  doctors and nurses  are asked to do a skilled and dangerous job. They should be treated with respect  and paid fairly in return.

To the Editor: Re “What You Should Know Before You Need a Ventilator ” by Kathryn Dreger (Op-Ed  nytimes.com  April 4): My fellow physician Dr. Kathryn Dreger details the realities of being intubated and ventilated. The bigger question that she raises is what each of us wants at the end of life  and what is important to us. Death will come to each of us  whether in the normal course of time or now  in the Covid-19 pandemic. We cannot escape that. But how we die is something we can sometimes influence. We have the ability to make choices about what and how much intervention we would want. For many of us  these choices do not get made until the middle of a crisis  and most often that is because we haven’t taken the time to talk with our loved ones about what we would want. If we haven’t thought that through and shared our thoughts with those who will care for us  then the path of least resistance  at least initially  is usually full intervention  full support  including the intubation and ventilation that Dr. Dreger details. The picture painted by Dr. Dreger ought to make us stop and think  “Is this really what I would want to go through if I get this disease?” And if not  the time is now to have the conversations  to be clear about our choices. Now … before it is too late. Martha Calihan Leesburg  Va. The writer  a family medicine doctor  is the author of “A Death Lived ” about making decisions about end-of-life care. To the Editor: Dr. Kathryn Dreger provides essential information for all of us dealing with this terrible pandemic  for who of us knows if we may well face this wrenching decision for ourselves or a loved one — whether to go the route of a ventilator or instead accept the inevitable consequences of acute respiratory distress syndrome  as she so vividly describes it. However  she omits a vital piece of information. While she explains that those who succumb to the disease after being intubated and ventilated face a death that is “typically painless ” she does not offer that assurance to those who may choose to forgo the ventilator route  saying only that they are faced with this decision “while they are on the verge of dying  breathless and terrified.” It would have been a great help and comfort to know that giving up the choice of a ventilator also means the assurance of palliative care that includes a relief from dying “breathless and terrified.” Janet Young Orleans  Mass. To the Editor: At almost 76 years old  I certainly am a Covid-19 ventilator treatment candidate. In my living will  written long before the pandemic  I request specifically not to be put on a ventilator. I mean it. I want palliative care  if any. I have had and have a wonderful life. I am nearing its end. I accept that. As a potential Covid-19 patient  I say: Let me be comfortable in my dying. Give the ventilators to those who will live to get off them. For me  no thanks. This is just my personal preference. It is not intended as a moral imperative. Nora Staffanell Monroe  N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Who Gets a Ventilator? ” by Daniela J. Lamas (Op-Ed  April 3): We found Dr. Lamas’s essay compelling  but we wish to clarify the ethical framework for these decisions. Several states have enacted guidelines  known as “crisis standards of care ” outlining how to allocate critical care resources when demand outstrips supply. These guidelines identify a triage officer within each institution who makes final decisions  based on the best data available  as to whether a scarce life-sustaining therapy should be offered to a patient or not. It is not the provider at the bedside who must make this decision. The triage officer is also expected to help communicate decisions to patients and families  sparing bedside physicians from the responsibility of conveying bad news. Though crisis standards of care will not eliminate the emotional toll of triage  these guidelines help unburden bedside physicians from the moral responsibility that Dr. Lamas fears.

Personal Experience., Across the country  unemployed workers are setting up online communities to help navigate the nightmare of crashed websites and confusing regulations., Supported by Across the country  unemployed workers are setting up online communities to help navigate the nightmare of crashed websites and confusing regulations. By Caitlin Dickerson Ever since she was furloughed from her job at a go-kart track in Las Vegas  Cyara Neel has been working harder than ever. The mother of three turns on her computer every morning from her king-size memory foam bed  after some coffee  and begins answering the more than 200 comments per hour she receives on the Facebook group she created to help fellow residents of Nevada who are trying to apply for unemployment benefits. The idea for the group came after Ms. Neel struggled with her state’s convoluted unemployment website. After filling out her application  an alert popped up that seemed to block it from being processed  and the website did not offer a clear answer to how she could resolve the problem. Her group  “Unemployment Nevada Information and Help” gained nearly 7 000 members in a week  and Ms. Neel has had to recruit nine additional moderators to help with the workload. “It’s been amazing the outpouring of people helping each other through these tough times ” she said. More than 16 million people have applied for unemployment benefits over the past three weeks  exceeding records by a staggering margin. As state governments struggle to keep up with applications  thousands have found themselves unable to file their claims. They are wading through antiquated websites that often crash or waiting on the phone  sometimes for eight hours or more  to speak to unemployment officers. Some say they have had to make hundreds of calls to reach a government worker  or were told they need to visit an office in person to have their application processed  even though the offices are closed. Earlier this week  hundreds of people formed a densely packed mass outside an unemployment office in Hialeah  Fla.  where they were waiting to pick up benefit applications when they could not get them online. After an outcry over the lack of social distancing  the crowds moved into their cars  which were lined up over more than a block. Around the country  people like Ms. Neel are stepping in to fill the void  creating an assortment of online communities  most on Facebook and Reddit  to help others navigate the impenetrable state bureaucracies. They offer help to a broad array of workers  from those in the R.V. industry  to dog walkers  delivery workers and restaurant servers. Some of the groups cover entire regions  from Sioux Falls  S.D.  to Portland  Ore. Most have been created not by experts  but by people who have struggled through the unemployment process themselves. “Within minutes of me starting this group I was overwhelmed ” said Shelby Glasson  a Goshen  Ind.  resident who created the group “Unemployment Help for the R.V. Industry During Covid-19.” The group now has nearly 400 members and gets dozens of posts a day. Ms. Glasson has worked in claims for an R.V. dealer in Goshen for 12 years. After taking her Yorkshire terriers out for a walk one afternoon in late March  she opened up her computer and was struck that the same questions about unemployment were popping up all over her social media networks: Should R.V. plant workers claim bonuses they earn or just hourly wages? When were the major factories and plants planning to reopen? Some wondered how the new claims might affect those that many industry workers file every year during the slow season  when periodic layoffs are typical. “Everybody was laid off at the same time and the questions were just flooding and  you know  it’s hard to try and answer one person on one page and then go to another page or another group to answer someone else ” Ms. Glasson said. One online group has been set up to help laid-off court reporters. Another is targeted at Cheesecake Factory restaurant workers in Las Vegas. The online communities offer advice  from what phone number to use for calling the local unemployment office to what time of day is best to call. They give tips on how to fill out applications to avoid being “flagged ” which can require a manual review by a government officer and add weeks to the time it takes to receive a check in the mail. People who run the groups acknowledge they are not experts. They advise members to post only about their own experiences — what has worked and what has not — with the hope that winning strategies will emerge through crowdsourcing. Some delays simply cannot be overcome  because of the lack of staffing in unemployment offices to handle the unprecedented workload. For those whose applications cannot be sped up  the online communities seem to offer a place for venting and mutual support. “Camaraderie and a sense that I’m not alone and I hope that everybody else on the site feels the same way ” Ms. Glasson said. One of the most common questions  moderators say  is how to apply for the additional $600 in weekly unemployment payments approved in the federal stimulus bill  which also opened the door to independent contract workers who were not previously eligible for benefits. “There are hundreds of people on there that are saying ‘Yay  I finally got my unemployment benefits ’ but the most these people are getting is the $247 a week ” said Wendy Manard  who created the “Louisiana Coronavirus Unemployment Legal Advice Group.” “That’s not enough for most people. Everybody’s really anxious about getting the extra $600 a week.” Ms. Manard is a personal-injury lawyer in New Orleans whose work has slowed down significantly because fewer cars are on the road  which means fewer accidents. Many clients are asking instead about how to get unemployment benefits. Though Ms. Manard had some experience with employment law in the past  she has quickly studied up. The Covid-19 group she created online surpassed in a few days the size of the legal advice group she has maintained for her law firm for years. She checks the Louisiana state unemployment website daily to keep up with frequent updates and creates videos to help members — who include real estate agents  Uber drivers  personal trainers  barbers and restaurant workers — to understand what the changes will mean for them. “It’s so many new rules and regulations all at once  and a lot of these people who have been impacted the worst are blue-collar workers ” Ms. Manard said. “They live paycheck to paycheck  and all of a sudden  they’ve lost their jobs or their kids are out of school and they’re like ‘What do I do now?’ It’s scary. It’s overwhelming for a lot of people.” Several moderators of the new groups said that the experience of being suddenly inundated with queries has given them sympathy for the government workers who are processing the claims. “The unemployment workers that are taking care of all of our cases are as overwhelmed with this whole system as we are now ” Ms. Glasson said. But they are also careful not to make the same mistakes they have seen state government website administrators make. When Ms. Neel  who created the Nevada group  decided last week to redesign her page to make it easier to use  she made sure beforehand that her moderators would be available to answer questions from members while she went about the task of deleting 24 000 comments and organizing them under topics — questions about student unemployment  interstate claims and appeals. During the few hours a day when she steps away from her computer to help her children with homework or to make dinner  her new work follows her on her cellphone. “If I walk away it goes with me ” she said. “Pretty much everywhere other than the bathroom.” Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Kimberley McGee contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.

Can the series once again replicate its unique brand of female-driven success?, Supported by The hit espionage show returns  just like last season  with the same lead cast but a new lead writer. Can the series once again replicate its unique brand of female-driven success? By Roslyn Sulcas LONDON — Sandra Oh scrabbled through the heaped-up trash in a dumpster  then suddenly let out a piercing scream. “Wow  excellent ” said her fellow actor Turlough Convery as the filming stopped. It was a gray  damp day in mid-December  and Oh and Convery were on the set of the BBC America espionage drama “Killing Eve” outside a shabby  institutional office building in East London. They were shooting Season 3  and the moment seemed to capture some essence of what Oh has always brought to her role as Eve Polastri — a quirky and passionate MI6 agent “whose instincts and resolve have to make up for her inexperience ” as Mike Hale wrote in The Times  “and her tendency to scream like a terrified child in the face of danger.” But this time  Oh hadn’t been acting. “That was genuine ” she said  her expression panicked. “Something moved in there!” Oh’s surprising  idiosyncratic performance  as well as that of her Emmy-winning co-star  Jodie Comer — pretty as a picture as the assassin Villanelle  and far more volatile — were two reasons “Killing Eve” surged in popularity after a relatively modest  if critically heralded  debut in 2018. Another was its creator  Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”)  whose razor-sharp adaptation of the novellas of Luke Jennings was a genre mash-up of mordant comedy and tense thriller  infused with the whisper of dark  unspoken desires. By the end of that first season  the series had doubled its audience  going on to win a Golden Globe. Season 2 built on those feats under a new lead writer  Emerald Fennell  earning the series an Emmy and multiple BAFTA awards  the British version of the Emmys. Now “Killing Eve” is back again  returning April 12 — yes  two weeks earlier than originally scheduled (“to put a bit of good news out there for the fans ” explained Sarah Barnett  the president of AMC Networks Entertainment Group.) Once again  it returns with a new lead writer (the British equivalent of a showrunner)  this time Suzanne Heathcote  a playwright and screenwriter best known for her work on “Fear the Walking Dead.” Once again  its producers are gambling with an already winning formula. Can the series repeat its success? Can it sustain its unique alchemy  which has made it a favorite among critics and awards juries? Perhaps  as Heathcote suggested  repetition is not the point. “There is always the issue of how to honor what came before and also do something new ” she said. “I spoke to Phoebe a lot  and she read the scripts  but she always said  it’s yours  make it your own.” Barnett elaborated. “It’s the antithesis of the ego-driven male showrunner thing ” she said. “Both Emerald and Suzanne are extraordinarily accomplished but had never had the opportunity to be a lead writer on a show. I love the fact that the show has given these women the chance to show what they are made of.” And  as she noted  they are all British. “I think there is something uniquely British in that mix of elegance and black humor ” she said. Across the first two seasons  that mix sustained a plot that was harrowing  gruesome and hilarious in turn. In Season 1  Eve  an American working in British intelligence  has her life upended by her growing obsession with the terrifying but seductive Villanelle  who leaves a trail of bodies wherever she goes. In Season 2 (spoilers ahead)  the two become unlikely collaborators in pursuit of a megalomaniacal tech billionaire. It ends as a thwarted Villanelle shoots Eve and leaves her for dead — a neat parallel with the end of Season 1  when Eve stabbed Villanelle. Heathcote’s approach to Season 3  she said  had been “to go deeper with each of the main characters.” “I felt it was important to see the consequences of what had happened in 1 and 2  personally and professionally for them ” she continued. “By a third season  we’ve earned that  we want to know what makes them tick.” Season 3 picks up after Eve has survived the shooting  has left MI6  and is working in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant  trying to keep her head down and her thoughts away from the past. But the past won’t go away — not for Eve  and not for Villanelle  who is uncomfortably reminded of her younger self by the appearance of her former Russian trainer. Nor will it rest for Carolyn (Fiona Shaw)  the steely MI6 operative who again draws Eve into an investigative web. “There has been a considerable evolution in Eve’s character ” Oh said in a makeshift dressing room inside the appropriated East London office building. “At the start of Season 1 you had a person with a wonderful naïveté about the world and her place in it. By Season 3 she is aware of the darker parts of herself  but she also has a certain weight  an understanding of life that she was craving at the beginning.” Heathcote’s emphasis on the characters’ psychology doesn’t come at the expense of the thriller elements that have infused the series with both horror and high jinks — part of the template set by Waller-Bridge  which the creative team says it has worked hard to preserve. “What Phoebe managed to do in the very first script is to take away that spy-genre trope where people are very serious and talk in a rather urgent way ” said Damon Thomas  who has directed episodes of each season and is an executive producer of the show. “She made everyone very real and brought out the absurdity of real life  and both Emerald and Suzanne have continued that.” Central to that subversion was Waller-Bridge’s original conception of Villanelle — a woman who is irresistible but might also shove a decorative hairpin through your eye. Waller-Bridge “had a vision about Villanelle  but she was never precious about it ” Comer said by phone. “I think people connect with her because she lives out our fantasies of saying what she thinks and doing what she likes. She has a confidence I admire.” In the new season  Comer said  the past rears up for Villanelle  who “is having to face her demons and emotions.” “She has suppressed a lot ” she continued. “I think she is fearful of herself in a way  and the season takes that in a very interesting direction.” Villanelle’s former trainer  Dasha (Harriet Walter)  a hard-bitten onetime Olympic athlete turned spy  is one of those elements from the past  adding yet another formidable female character to the show. “Phoebe’s vision of a woman at the heart of badness is quite complex  and more about the bad girls we want to be  transgressive for ourselves  not to attract anybody else ” Walter said in a phone interview. “She is a great character  with a kind of fanatical patriotism about Russia that Villanelle doesn’t have.” “But she trained Villanelle ” Walter added. “There is a certain anarchy about both  and about it all; I think people love that outrageous daring.” “Killing Eve” is often described as female-centric  but it also has important male characters  like Villanelle’s handler Konstantin (Kim Bodnia); Eve’s husband  Niko (Owen McDonnell); and Carolyn’s son  Kenny (Sean Delaney). Shaw  who plays Eve’s boss  Carolyn  said that while she didn’t think the preponderance of major female characters and writers made any difference in the day-to-day experience of working on the show  she did appreciate the opportunities given to female writers. “There is no doubt that some of the humor is spun from female minds  but it’s not the female equivalent of male humor  it’s just good ” Shaw said by phone. “All humor has to have jeopardy in it  and maybe that’s what women haven’t been allowed. It’s dangerous  it’s sexy  but it’s not crude  even if it’s miles from Jane Austen.” Shaw  whose character is seen from a more personal perspective this season  said that Heathcote’s background as a playwright had been a boon for Season 3  which takes some interesting formal risks. “She has the skills and surety to bring together themes and threads that are set up early on  and she can really play with comedy and tragedy ” Shaw said. “It all swerves completely and you are no longer in the places you were.” It was odd  Shaw observed  to be talking about TV during a pandemic  which seemed to reframe so many aspects of daily living. But Oh  who made a similar observation during a recent follow-up conversation  said the current environment had made her think about the characters’ experiences in a new light. “This third season really picks up on a more nihilistic tone ” Oh said  “where both the central characters wake up to an understanding of their lack of choice  of the oppression of having been controlled by an outside force. We can relate it to this time  when we are all isolated and forced to think of the systems we live under.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/arts/09killing-eve1/09killing-eve1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/multimedia/03-Parenting-screentime/03-Parenting-screentime-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/travel/13coronavirus-52-promo/13coronavirus-52-promo-mediumThreeByTwo210-v2.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/realestate/13virus-quarantine/13virus-quarantine-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/arts/13livestreaming-art/13livestreaming-art-mediumThreeByTwo210-v3.jpg

Classical Music I confess: I don’t typically like listening to excerpts from extended works. Nor do I enjoy hearing other compositions sandwiched between different movements of a major piece. (Just play something whole — and then do something else!) But “Healing Modes ” a new album from the string quartet Brooklyn Rider  has turned me around on this strategy. Before the group engages with one of Beethoven’s rapturously admired late quartets  Op. 132  they open with a new piece by the reliably fascinating composer and improvising saxophonist Matana Roberts. Titled “borderlands … ” her composition uses graphic as well as traditional notation. Textures proliferate quickly in the quartet’s performance: Droning tones  staccato rhythmic explosions and restless pizzicato are all in motion. (The string players also have to use their voices — recalling the incantatory approach of Roberts’s recordings as a bandleader.) It’s intriguing on its own  and also a rewarding setup for the rest of the album  which alternates between movements of the Beethoven quartet and various shorter works by other contemporary artists (including the Pulitzer Prize winners Du Yun and Caroline Shaw). For me  the sequencing worked wonders. I don’t believe I’ve ever experienced the radical emotional range of Op. 132’s long  slow movement — with its liberating  dancing interjections — more intensely than when listening to the entirety of “Healing Modes.” And if you must hear the master’s quartet in its regular order  you can always buy the digital files and reshuffle the tracks in a playlist. (In this perilous period for performers  please consider paying artists for albums you enjoy.) SETH COLTER WALLS Theater/Television When passionately hate-watching NBC’s “Smash” back in 2012-13  many viewers complained it was lame and unrealistic. Fine  so the musical-theater-themed drama lacked the rigor of a Frederick Wiseman documentary. What it did have was great singing by the likes of Megan Hilty  Jeremy Jordan and Will Chase  as well as wackadoo antics. Now that “Smash” is easily accessible on streaming platforms  it’s high time to reclaim the show. (If you have a cable subscription  you can watch it free on NBC.com  or you can rent or buy it from Amazon  Fandango  Google Play  iTunes or Vudu.) “Smash” started semi-seriously as a backstage story about the making of a (fictional) Broadway musical called “Bombshell.” It was not long — say  the second episode — until it devolved into a nutty soap opera. In hindsight  neither the creators nor the showrunners seemed to realize that the insanity was the point. That  and cranking out many really good tunes  including Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman’s “History Is Made at Night ” Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s “Rewrite This Story” and Joe Iconis’s “Broadway  Here I Come!” Those numbers were written for “Bombshell” and its Season 2 rival  the supposedly grittier “Hit List.” Some of us harbor hope that one day reality will catch up to fiction and these musicals will come to an actual stage. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI Comedy “Gayme Show!” is a straightforward  gay-positive comedy competition that its creators and hosts  Matt Rogers and Dave Mizzoni  developed for more than a year at the Lower East Side basement club Caveat. As its popularity grew  it moved to larger performance spaces such as the Bell House and the Gramercy Theater. If you missed out on the live experience  or if you just miss live comedy  you can now view “Gayme Show!” on Quibi  the new smartphone streaming platform for short-form videos  founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg. In these seven-minute episodes  Rogers and Mizzoni deftly whisk the audience through a competition in which two heterosexual comedians vie for the title of “Queen of the Straights.” Each contestant receives help from a celebrity partner (in the first episode  Bowen Yang of “Saturday Night Live” and Ilana Glazer of “Broad City” provide the assist). It’s easy  breezy fun. Other comedy programs that will soon join “Gayme Show” on Quibi include “Nice One! ” an adaptation of the compliment competition Boast Rattle; “Let’s Go Atsuko! ” a spin on Japanese game shows that tests how “woke” comedians are; and “This Joka ” from Will Smith  which features sets by stand-up comedians  and Smith’s interviews with them  filmed in Las Vegas. Quibi is offering a free 90-day trial for those who sign up by April 30; subscriptions to the app range from about $5 to $8. SEAN L. McCARTHY Dance In the past few weeks  online dance classes have become the new normal  as dancers and dance instructors keep themselves and others active at home. But long before gathering in studios was off limits  the New York choreographer Katy Pyle was teaching ballet remotely — or more specifically  Ballez  Pyle’s inclusive and imaginative style of ballet training. Pyle (who uses the pronoun “they”) created the YouTube series Ballez Class Everywhere last year  as a way to bring their method to more people  especially outside of major metropolitan areas. Like Pyle’s dance company (also called Ballez)  a Ballez class embraces all body types and forms of gender identity and expression. If you’ve ever felt curious about ballet but are turned off by its narrow definition of “perfect ” Ballez Class Everywhere is for you. Joined by members of their company  who stand at barres arranged in a circle (a Ballez class hallmark)  Pyle leads viewers through 12 short exercises (about an hour total)  offering colorful prompts and historical context  as well as compassionate directives: “If anything hurts  don’t do it.” As someone who has always felt out of place in ballet class  I had more fun doing the series in my bedroom  holding on to the back of a kitchen chair  than I’ve ever had at a more conventional barre. If you’re up for something more advanced  Pyle is now teaching Pro Ballez Barre and Stretch via Zoom. Follow @ballez.company on Instagram for details. SIOBHAN BURKE Pop NPR Music has amassed an impressive following on its YouTube channel through its Tiny Desk series  which for more than a decade has invited musicians — at first  indie acts like Beirut and  more recently  superstars including Lizzo and Taylor Swift — to perform in a charmingly cluttered corner of its offices. But the channel is also home to the Front Row series  a trove of concert footage filmed in more conventional settings. Offerings range from a 19-year-old Chance the Rapper bounding around a small South by Southwest stage to a revved-up Lucinda Williams holding court at the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival. For those of us with ample time on our hands  some of the best selections are full-length sets clocking in at over an hour. While live music’s sense of communion can hardly be approximated through a screen  these videos offer a different kind of thrill: a chance to peek under the hood at all the discrete parts — voices  gadgets  masses of tangled wire — that make up the transcendent whole. The view is better than any you’ll get craning to see over strangers’ heads in a darkened room. Start with Bon Iver’s 2016 performance at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn. Captured shortly after the release of the singer-songwriter’s album “22  a Million ” the video features nearly a dozen musicians assembled to reconstruct that record’s glitchy electronics and prismatic vocals in real time. In a moment of collective crisis  the prevailing themes of uncertainty and alienation in these songs are especially resonant. OLIVIA HORN KIDS The Trusty Sidekick Theater Company is living up to its name  even in a time of social distancing. This appealing troupe  which offers intriguing and sometimes immersive productions  is posting much of its repertory online. Every Monday since mid-March  the company has been adding an archival video of a show to its website  where you can stream most of the performances free through June. Have antsy preschoolers? Send them on a trip to the moon with “Shadow Play ” a beguiling and almost wordless multimedia adventure in which a boy’s rebellious silhouette takes off on its own. Or join the dance party in “Scurry ” a tale about toe-tapping friends who are in for a big surprise. Interested in discovering wildness in the city? “Campfire ” a nature celebration  will be posted on Monday. If your youngsters are school-age  try a Shakespeare mash-up. “The Stowaway (or How the Mistress Quickly Went From Madcap to Majestic)” — which features a seafaring heroine  a missing duke and his dictatorial substitute — makes Elizabethan comedy digestible. And for children on the autism spectrum  Trusty Sidekick presents “Up and Away ” a hot-air-balloon voyage that you can stream now. The company plans to add new titles  including shows for tweens and teens  through May 25. It also offers some related online activities  like dance lessons from “Scurry.” On Friday  a video of a puppetry workshop inspired by “Shadow Play” will go up on the website. Bring cardboard  scissors  a pencil  imagination and your own trusty silhouette.

A refrigerated trailer serving as a temporary morgue outside a hospital in Brooklyn on Tuesday. Officials in New York City are citing a slowdown in hospitalizations as evidence that social distancing and other modifications are working to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Credit...Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times Supported by By Dan Barry The world began this week to see small but encouraging signs that concerted efforts to drastically change human behavior — to suspend daily routines by staying at home — are slowing the insidious spread of the novel coronavirus  which has killed tens of thousands and sickened more than a million others across several continents. But — a simple word that epidemiologists say cannot be emphasized enough — these early indications  while promising  must not be interpreted to mean that all will be well by summer’s first days. Although President Trump tweeted on Monday about a light at the end of a tunnel  the cautions of scientists and other government officials conjure one very  very long tunnel. In the Chinese city of Wuhan  where the coronavirus publicly emerged in December  the end to a monthslong lockdown has residents taking baby steps toward some version of normality. In Italy  where the next viral wave has killed more than 17 000  a delayed but committed resolve to stay inside has greatly decreased the rate of contagion. And in the United States  the death toll  now growing by well over a thousand a day  has continued to mount  with the last few days the country’s deadliest so far in this pandemic. Yet Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  said Wednesday on Fox News that he was starting to see “some glimmers of hope ” so much so that he expected that previous projections of 100 000 to 200 000 virus-related deaths would be lowered. Even in New York City  now the ghastly epicenter where hundreds continue to die every day  officials cite a slowdown in hospitalizations as evidence that social distancing and other modifications — not least the shutdown of the city’s vibrancy and economy — are working. “We are flattening the curve ” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday  a day when the state reported more than 700 deaths. “Thank God. Thank God. Thank. God.” Without doubt  frightening developments continue to emerge in many places across the United States  and scientists and political leaders warn that the picture is shifting by the day. Amid cause for tempered optimism were new flashes of misery. In Wayne County  Mich.  which includes Detroit  192 deaths have been announced this week. In Mahoning County  Ohio  which includes Youngstown  the death toll grew on Wednesday  to 28 from 19. In Illinois  state officials reported 82 additional deaths  many in the Chicago area. And near St. Louis  where cases and deaths have been increasing rapidly  the Missouri National Guard was converting a hotel into a treatment site ready to accept patients next week. Still  experts said  there were tentative signals of reassurance. The reason is fairly elemental  according to Ashish Jha  the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute: “On a very simple level  you can’t give the virus to someone else if you’re not physically near them.” Stay-at-home orders nearly halted travel for most Americans by late March  an analysis of anonymous cellphone location data by The New York Times found. Americans in much of the Northeast  Midwest and West complied with orders from state and local officials to stay home  the data suggests  but delays in enacting such orders in other areas  including parts of the Southeast  potentially dampened the impact of social distancing measures. “It’s just math ” Natalie Dean  an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida  said. “If people dramatically reduce the number of people they’re interacting with  that will reduce the spread of the disease.” “These types of strategies have worked ” she added. But the many variables at play — beginning with the unpredictable nature of the virus — demand that the efficacy of these strategies be placed in context. In the United States  there are the decisions by some states not to impose stay-at-home orders; the fears that warmer weather will lure people into socializing; and  especially  the low and inconsistent availability of testing  a fundamental tool in tracking the disease and preventing spread. “What we’ve seen in the short term is that very stringent measures  that have a lot of societal impact  have been effective at reducing the rate of growth ” said Joseph Lewnard  an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of California  Berkeley. “Unfortunately  the flattening of the curve we see now does not necessarily paint a rosy picture about reopening society as it was before the epidemic ” he said. Without a vaccine  any progress is fragile  temporary. The social distancing measures cannot continue forever. And if they are relaxed without meticulous testing and the isolation of new patients  researchers say  the numbers of infections and fatalities are likely to soar again. Dr. Lewnard and Dr. Jha said months could pass before Americans would be able to return to their pre-pandemic lifestyles of unrestricted movement. Even then  they said  such a return would best take place in stages  with the government remaining vigilant for signs of outbreak. “I can imagine May into June  we might see things opening up by 25 to 50 percent ” Dr. Jha said. “We might be up to 70 to 80 percent by the summer but no large gatherings  no baseball games  no super-crowded beaches. “We’ll have to experiment.” What Dr. Jha envisions for the United States in a couple of months is where the city of Wuhan essentially is now — mostly because of the draconian measures taken by China’s authoritarian government  including the requirement that people with even mild symptoms be remanded to mass quarantine sites. In December  doctors in Wuhan’s hospitals sounded the alarm about a mysterious pneumonialike illness  only to be reprimanded for spreading rumors. The Chinese government eventually took action  but only after significant delays in addressing the virus and informing the public about the possibility of human-to-human transmission. Wuhan  a city of 11 million  was locked down  as was the surrounding Hubei province  with nearly 60 million residents. About the only hives of human activity were the overwhelmed hospitals  where there were too few test kits for too many patients  who in turn were infecting others  including health care workers. Across the country  the enactment of Mao-era social controls limited the movement of citizens and slowed the economy to a near standstill. The most severe measures  though  were applied to Wuhan  where the sick and potentially exposed were separated from families and sent to mass quarantine centers and isolation sites. “The most important thing was not the lockdown ” said Xihong Lin  a professor of biostatistics at Harvard University who recently took part in a paper examining the government’s epidemic response in Wuhan. “The most important thing was to take the source of infections out of the network so that family members could be protected.” As of Wednesday  the coronavirus had officially sickened 81 865 and killed 3 335 in China  though the country has been accused by American intelligence officials of vastly underreporting its epidemic statistics. In addition  the government’s extreme measures were by no means flawless; mismanagement cost lives  and the impact on the economy and mental health has yet to be determined. Still  experts agree that China’s swift if ruthless actions stemmed the invisible tide. “Each country can use Wuhan’s experience and adapt it to its own situation and culture ” Dr. Lin said. On Wednesday  as an unfettered Wuhan stepped hesitantly into its altered future  a commentary published by Xinhua  the state-run news agency  celebrated the city’s determination and hard work through the epidemic — but noted that “cautious unblocking is far from a final victory over the health threat.” From Wuhan  the coronavirus moved in greatest intensity to Italy. Once again  delays in carrying out a full-throated form of social distancing had deadly consequence. By the time a man in Italy’s Lombardy region had tested positive for the virus  on Feb. 20  he had likely infected many  including those in a local hospital. Three days later  health officials found an apparently unrelated outbreak. The country’s northern region began closing schools and museums and putting a curfew on bars  while at the same time some politicians in Rome were assuring the world that Italy was safe to visit and that only a very small percentage of Italians had the virus. That soon changed. While some in charge argued and dithered  the virus became a wildfire  with hundreds of cases multiplying into thousands. By the time the government closed the entire country — an unprecedented lockdown for a Western democracy — on March 10  waves of infection were swamping northern Italy’s overwhelmed health system  forcing doctors to make godlike decisions about which patients would most benefit from breathing equipment. For the most part  Italians stayed at home  as deaths mounted daily by the hundreds. And by early April  its restrictive measures seemed to be slowing the rate of contagion. On Tuesday  officials reported the fewest number of new infections since the first days after the national lockdown. Now the Italian government is preparing a slow  measured reopening. Schools will likely remain closed until September  and leaving home may be contingent on test results. “This is an extraordinary result ” Italy’s health minister  Roberto Speranza  said on television on Tuesday evening  after the latest statistics showed that the rate of contagion had decreased from one person infecting around three people to one person infecting just one. “The measures have worked and we can finally start planning the future.” But he emphasized that Italy could not afford to let down its guard. “It takes little to spoil the work we have done so far ” Mr. Speranza said. “It only takes wrong timing  wrong behavior  some lightness — excessive optimism.” After Italy  the world’s coronavirus hot spot became New York State  where 6 268 have died in the pandemic  including 779 in one day this week. While most of the deaths — more than 4 000 — have been in an unnaturally quiet New York City  hundreds more have been reported in suburban Westchester and on Long Island  and officials say that others are probably dying at home  uncounted as victims of the virus. Normally  workers from the city’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner arrive within a few hours to collect a body. Now the wait can be as long as 24 hours  according to Lt. Edwin Raymond  a police officer who works in northern Brooklyn and who has responded to nine 911 calls involving dead bodies in six days. The ambulance siren has become the soundtrack of the city as deaths soared  Lieutenant Raymond said. “This thing — from a cough to a fever to pronounced within a week.” Among the likely reasons for the high numbers  experts say  are the city’s high population density and the protracted time before stay-at-home orders were put into place. “You just got a bad hand to start with ” George Rutherford  a professor of epidemiology at the University of California  San Francisco  said to a reporter calling him from New York City. During his daily news conference on Wednesday  Governor Cuomo in no way minimized the horror of death at such a scale  at a time when even the basic rituals of mourning have been upended. That is why he said he had “mixed emotions” over the news that the number of hospitalizations had fallen in recent days  indicating that social distancing measures  at least for now  were flattening the upward arc of infections. “If we stop what we are doing  you will see that curve change ” Mr. Cuomo said. The governor’s very qualified sense of progress is shared by Jeffrey Shaman  a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University who is advising New York City. “There’s some room for some optimism on this front ” Dr. Shaman said. But he also warned that “we should not be exuberant and not get ahead of ourselves ” and said that another two weeks may tell whether New York’s curve is undeniably flattening. The professor searched for the right term to describe his state of mind before settling on “patiently optimistic.” Elsewhere in the country  where communities are either grappling with or bracing for their pandemic moment  government officials are emphasizing the necessity of social distancing by citing statistics that are simultaneously upsetting and reassuring. In Washington State  where in February the virus rampaged through a nursing home in Kirkland  eventually killing 37 people  the rate of spread has started to level off  and some comfort is taken that the number of deaths is not rising as quickly as in other states. Over the weekend  Gov. Jay Inslee reported that the state was returning ventilators provided by the federal government. And on Wednesday  he announced that an Army field hospital the federal government had built next to CenturyLink Field in Seattle would be removed  now that concerns about hospital capacity have waned. “These soldiers uprooted their lives to help Washingtonians when we needed them most ” Mr. Inslee said. “Since then  it’s become apparent that other states need them more than we do.” Further evidence of the impact of social distancing is found in California  where many counties moved early to impose stay-at-home orders and where researchers have reduced their death toll projections. The state is now loaning hundreds of ventilators to other places in need. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday even referred to a “sense of optimism” that the state had kept its rate of infections below the levels that would strain hospitals. Tempering that optimism are the sheer numbers in California — 17 000 coronavirus cases and at least 440 deaths — as well as the prediction by state officials that waves of infection will continue. Dr. Mark Ghaly  the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency  said the state’s peak would come in late May. With so many uncertainties about the course of the coronavirus at play — in good measure because so little actual testing has been conducted — city and state leaders have seized on the apparent effects of social distancing as a way to raise hopes and rally their communities to stay the course. In Detroit  which has reported more than 5 800 cases and more than 250 deaths  hospitals cannot handle the number of sick and a convention center has been converted into a field hospital. Hundreds of public employees have been quarantined and thousands of health care workers have tested positive for the virus. Fear pulsates through the empty streets of the city. But Mayor Mike Duggan on Tuesday reported what he called “the first glimmer of light” — indications that social distancing was slowing the city’s death rate. He seemed to channel Winston Churchill in both his candor and reassurance. “We’re going to lose a lot of our neighbors in the coming days ” Detroit’s mayor said. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better. But we can beat this if we keep doing what we’re doing.” Reporting was contributed by Mike Baker  John Eligon  Thomas Fuller  James Glanz  Joseph Goldstein  Jason Horowitz  Danielle Ivory  Sarah Kliff  Amy Qin  Mitch Smith and Karen Yourish. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/us/08virus-globalwave/08virus-globalwave-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-dan-barry/author-dan-barry-thumbLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/us/08virus-globalwave04/merlin_168432426_4df6d5d9-9f8a-4ae7-865e-b5339acc2b6f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Biden Jr.  who emerges as the presumptive nominee for the general election., Supported by Mr. Sanders  a democratic socialist making his second run for the White House  withdrew after a series of losses to Joseph R. Biden Jr.  who emerges as the presumptive nominee for the general election. transcript I wish I could give you better news. But I think you know the truth. And that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden  and the path toward victory is virtually impossible. So while we are winning the ideological battle  and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country  I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful. And so today  I am announcing the suspension of my campaign. Please know that I do not make this decision lightly. In fact  it has been a very difficult and painful decision. In this most desperate hour  I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win  and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour. While this campaign is coming to an end  our movement is not. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us that  “The arc of the moral universe is long  but it bends toward justice.” The fight for justice is what our campaign has been about  the fight for justice is what our movement remains about. By Sydney Ember Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont ended his presidential candidacy on Wednesday  concluding a quest that elevated him as a standard-bearer of American liberalism and clearing the way for a general election between the presumptive Democratic nominee  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  and President Trump at a time of national crisis. In a live-streamed speech  Mr. Sanders  eloquent but without his characteristic spark  cast his decision in the broader context of the fight against the coronavirus. “I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour ” Mr. Sanders said  adding  “While this campaign is coming to an end  our movement is not.” If Mr. Biden  the former vice president  can now lay claim to the Democratic nomination  he still faces considerable challenges in uniting the party and mobilizing a broad base of voters for the November election. Unlike Mr. Sanders  Mr. Biden inspired little enthusiasm among young voters  nor did he develop signature policy proposals. He triumphed because many voters rejected Mr. Sanders’s policy agenda as too far to the left and prohibitively expansive  and were convinced that Mr. Biden had the best chance to beat Mr. Trump in November. To motivate liberal Democrats who find him frustratingly conventional  Mr. Biden  77  will most likely need to do far more to articulate an agenda on foundational Democratic issues like health care and climate change. Those issues are central to Mr. Sanders’s candidacy  and in recent days  as Mr. Sanders began to consider dropping out more seriously  his aides intensified talks to find common ground with the Biden campaign. Mr. Sanders ultimately became satisfied that there was movement in directions that he wanted  a top aide said. The Biden campaign is expected to roll out a series of policy agreements with Mr. Sanders on health care and other issues — potentially including student loans — starting on Thursday  according to three people with direct knowledge of their plans. The two camps were still negotiating the details on Wednesday  and while Mr. Biden is not expected to embrace Mr. Sanders’s full-throated call for “Medicare for all ” for example  they are striving to arrive at positions with which they are both comfortable. Shortly after Mr. Sanders spoke on Wednesday  Mr. Biden issued a statement thanking his opponent while acknowledging the need to draw Mr. Sanders’s loyal base into his coalition. “I’ll be reaching out to you ’’ Mr. Biden wrote. “You will be heard by me.” “And to your supporters " he added  “I make the same commitment: I see you  I hear you  and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.” Though Mr. Sanders made it clear on Wednesday that he viewed Mr. Biden as the party’s 2020 nominee  he said he would remain on the ballot in states that still have primaries to try to gather delegates — a move that could give him leverage to influence the Democratic platform and continue carrying his message. Mr. Sanders’s departure from the race is a striking turnaround for a candidate who less than two months ago was the clear front-runner  after finishing in a virtual tie for first in Iowa and winning in New Hampshire and Nevada. But in a race reshaped  and eclipsed  by the escalating coronavirus crisis  Mr. Sanders faced no realistic path to the nomination after a series of lopsided losses to Mr. Biden  beginning in South Carolina in late February and culminating with victories by Mr. Biden in crucial states like Michigan and Florida last month. Persistent and unyielding in pushing his agenda  Mr. Sanders is loath to admit defeat; his withdrawal represents a tacit concession that without a chance of overtaking Mr. Biden  he would have more leverage to advance his priorities if he ceded the race and joined forces with his rival. His exit is also a sharp contrast to his bid in 2016  when he stayed in an increasingly acrimonious race against Hillary Clinton even after it became clear she would be the nominee. Talks between the Biden and Sanders camps this time around were eased by the cordial relationship between the two principals. Mr. Sanders has told people close to him that he appreciated the fact that Mr. Biden did not overtly pressure him to quit after Super Tuesday. Mr. Sanders also talked to former President Barack Obama at least twice in the last month  a person familiar with the discussions said  with Mr. Obama praising the Vermont senator’s campaign and emphasizing the need to unite against Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama  who has told friends he hopes to ease the integration of Sanders voters into the party  made no effort to pressure him to leave. As Mr. Sanders pursued the White House for a second time  he promised that he could transform the electorate  bringing new voters under the Democratic tent  but that goal eluded him. Even Mr. Sanders has lamented that he was unable to produce a surge in young voters. In early primaries this year  he also failed to show that he had remedied a crucial weakness from his 2016 run: a lack of support from black voters  a vital base of the Democratic Party. In state after state across the South — Alabama  the Carolinas  Mississippi  Virginia — he was unable to chip away at Mr. Biden’s strong support among African-Americans. In many ways  Mr. Sanders never overcame the widely held view among Democrats that he was a political outlier  a self-described democratic socialist who proudly proclaimed himself to be an independent senator from Vermont rather than a member of the party establishment. Mr. Sanders championed liberal policies like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free four-year public colleges aimed at lifting up America’s working class  but he faced opposition from many party leaders  elected officials and major donors  as well as large numbers of moderate voters who saw him as too far left. Mr. Sanders never accepted that argument. In recent weeks he said repeatedly that he had won the ideological debate  asserting that a strong majority of Democrats supported his progressive agenda. But during a striking news conference in Burlington  Vt.  last month  he also acknowledged that he was losing the electability battle to Mr. Biden  saying voters had made clear that they thought the former vice president was the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump. The president immediately tried to sow discord among Democrats. In a Twitter post he blamed Mr. Sanders’s inability to win Super Tuesday states on his ideological rival  Senator Elizabeth Warren  and then invited Sanders supporters to “come to the Republican Party.” At his evening news briefing Mr. Trump was more pointed toward Mr. Biden  saying “It amazes me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn’t happened. When’s it going to happen?” Indeed  Mr. Trump’s penchant for no-holds-barred political combat presents another challenge for Mr. Biden. Some Democrats question whether he can withstand the kind of bitingly personal onslaught that Mr. Trump is certain to direct his way in the general election. The president’s efforts to tar Mr. Biden with the overseas business dealings of his son  Hunter  already upended the campaign once and led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Mr. Sanders  78  leaves the campaign having almost single-handedly moved the Democratic Party to the left. He also transformed the way Democratic campaigns raised money  eschewing big fund-raisers and instead relying on an army of small-dollar donors. But as he ascended to the top of the field in February  establishment Democrats scrambled to block his path  convinced his far-reaching proposals would alienate great swaths of the electorate and make him an easy target for Mr. Trump. Moderate candidates in the race who could not overcome Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed him just before Super Tuesday  on March 3  helping him sweep 10 of 14 states on the biggest voting day of the primary. That led to a wave of new endorsements and a remarkable coalescing around Mr. Biden that Mr. Sanders could not match on the left. Mr. Sanders’s insistence on Wednesday that he wants to amass delegates to exert influence on the platform has convinced some Democrats that a scaled-down or even virtual convention this summer might be preferable to a traditional event. If the nomination is conferred virtually  the argument goes  Mr. Biden’s campaign can control the platform deliberations and program entirely  and ensure minimal dissent from Sanders supporters. The networks and cable stations would still carry whatever speeches Mr. Biden’s advisers plan and there would be no live audience to interrupt the proceedings. For most of his campaign Mr. Sanders largely stuck to his familiar message  battling establishment forces rather than his immediate rivals. Amid a slump in the polls in the fall  he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas  a startling event that threatened to upend his bid. But in a remarkable turn of events — as he stood on the debate stage just two weeks after his heart attack — he received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York  one of the most visible liberal congresswomen and a star of the left. It helped jump-start his candidacy just as it appeared in jeopardy of collapsing. The endorsement helped carry him through the late fall and early winter  and in January  as the first voting approached  Mr. Sanders was surging. When he dominated the field in the Nevada caucuses in February there was suddenly talk that he might run away with the nomination. But his loss in South Carolina to Mr. Biden  who had emerged as the leading moderate in the race  brought his momentum to an abrupt halt. Glenn Thrush  Alexander Burns  Jonathan Martin and Reid J.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/republicans-vote-by-mail.html, us politics, Why Republicans Are So Afraid of Vote-by-Mail, Public health officials recommend absentee ballots to keep people safe. But President Trump and his party  without evidence  portray expanded voting measures as ripe for fraud., Supported by Public health officials recommend absentee ballots to keep people safe. But President Trump and his party  without evidence  portray expanded voting measures as ripe for fraud. By Jim Rutenberg  Maggie Haberman and Nick Corasaniti President Trump and his Republican allies are launching an aggressive strategy to fight what many of the administration’s own health officials view as one of the most effective ways to make voting safer amid the deadly spread of Covid-19: the expanded use of mail-in ballots. The scene Tuesday of Wisconsinites in masks and gloves gathering in long lines to vote  after Republicans sued to defeat extended  mail-in ballot deadlines  did not deter the president and top officials in his party. Republican leaders said they were pushing ahead to fight state-level statutes that could expand absentee balloting in Michigan  Minnesota  Arizona and elsewhere. In New Mexico  Republicans are battling an effort to go to a mail-in-only primary  and they vowed on Wednesday to fight a new move to expand postal balloting in Minnesota. The new political effort is clearly aimed at helping the president’s re-election prospects  as well as bolstering Republicans running further down the ballot. While his advisers tend to see the issue in more nuanced terms  Mr. Trump obviously views the issue in a stark  partisan way: He has complained that under Democratic plans for national expansion of early voting and voting by mail  “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” At his daily news briefing on Wednesday  Mr. Trump said he believed vote-by-mail had been abused to hurt Republicans  and “I will not stand for it ” though he allowed that mail ballots could help some older voters — an important part of his voting base. It was a slight modulation that came at the urging of his advisers. He expanded on the idea on Twitter on Wednesday evening  calling absentee ballots “a great way to vote for the many senior citizens  military  and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day.” He added that universal mail-in voting “shouldn’t be allowed!” In their efforts to fight expanding vote-by-mail  Republican officials are counting on a crucial and powerful ally: like-minded judges. This week  conservative majorities on the U.S. Supreme Court and the highest court in Wisconsin indicated they did not view the pandemic as cause to yield on ideology  issuing party-line rulings rejecting Democratic efforts to defer Tuesday’s vote or extend mail-in balloting. The decisions seemed to augur a hard road for Democrats in the looming court fights over how to proceed with voting in this crisis moment. “We know moving forward that we will face a hostile court  that’s not new ” said Tom Perez  the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. But he indicated that it was just the beginning of a prolonged fight. “What they have done is invited further litigation  because they literally  quite literally  disenfranchised voters who had relied in good faith on the court.” Ronna McDaniel  the Republican Party chairwoman  argued in an interview on Fox Business that the Democrats “want to take away the safeguards that ensure the integrity of the election process ” accusing them of trying to force “election reforms across the country during a time of crisis.” The push to limit voting options is in keeping with Republicans’ decades-running campaign to impose restrictions that disproportionately affect people of color  the poor  and younger voters  under the banner of combating voter fraud — which is exceedingly rare. Democrats have more core constituencies among the nation’s disenfranchised  and both parties have long believed that easier voting measures will benefit Democrats. But the current public health crisis brings new urgency to the battle  as Democrats and some Republican state officials turn to expanded voting by mail as an important way to avoid the serious health hazard of crowded polling stations amid a pandemic. In a pre-coronavirus world  Republicans found that the specter of voter fraud and the need for tighter voter restrictions were popular messages with segments of their base. If there was a chance that the political equation might change with the pandemic  Mr. Trump and his allies have not seemed concerned. The president has embraced some of the most outlandishly false claims about voter fraud  at times proclaiming that the popular vote in the 2016 election — which he lost — was “rigged.” He has long impugned voting by mail  which  while more vulnerable to fraud than in-person voting  has proved overwhelmingly secure in states with mail-in elections  including Colorado and Washington State. (Mr. Trump had formed a special commission to investigate voter fraud in 2016 but it produced no evidence before he shut it down in 2018.) Even so  he applied for his own mail-in ballot in Florida in March. He has remained consistent in his opposition to mail-in voting throughout the coronavirus crisis  even as his lead health agency in the pandemic  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  lists postal balloting as its first recommendation to reduce crowd size at polling stations. Mr. Trump has also argued against the second C.D.C. recommendation  encouraging early voting periods  saying they were “not the greatest because a lot of things happen.” Advisers to Mr. Trump say that he has been set off by Democratic efforts  led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi  to include more aggressive efforts to promote absentee voting in a version of the coronavirus relief legislative package  which the Republican National Committee has equated with a “one-size-fits-all” approach that infringed upon states’ rights. “States should maintain primary responsibility for their voting laws  making changes where necessary and utilizing flexibility within their existing laws ” said Justin Clark  the senior counsel to the Trump campaign. Perhaps wary of the politics of taking an absolutist position amid the pandemic  and aware that absentee ballots can also be a preferred form of voting for some of Mr. Trump’s supporters  advisers to the president said that he would adapt his position in the coming days — like his nod to older voters on Wednesday — to acknowledge that absentee voting is acceptable  but that it must conform to the laws passed by specific states. In practice in Wisconsin  Mr. Trump’s position led to a clear  partisan advantage for the state Republicans  who had appeared to brazenly trade public health for the political gain of lower turnout in Democratic bastions like Milwaukee. Though results will not be released until April 13  simple turnout numbers in Milwaukee indicate that the Republican gambit worked. The city  which in 2016 had more than 167 000 people cast their ballots during the spring elections  most likely saw less than half that on Tuesday: Only 18 803 voted in person  and another 56 000 or so returned their absentee ballots. Though some may still be in transit  it is unlikely that Milwaukee  a Democratic stronghold in the state  will come close to matching its 2016 numbers. Mr. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016  and both parties view the state as pivotal in 2020 — “the tipping point state ” Mr. Perez has called it. The president followed Tuesday’s election closely  going so far as to weigh in several times to urge voters to support the State Supreme Court justice Daniel Kelly  an extraordinary  down-ballot focus for a sitting president. Mr. Trump has taken such a keen interest in the race  advisers said  in part because Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had spoken to him several times about the significance of such local campaigns — and because it represents a distraction from the grimness of the coronavirus that has gripped the country. But Mr. Kelly is also among the five conservative justices on the seven-member State Supreme Court  and his re-election would preserve that comfortable balance for Republicans as legal wrangling over voting continues. The low turnout was viewed as a boon for his prospects to stay on the court. “Nothing that Republicans do in Wisconsin is not part of the Trump campaign’s re-election strategy ” said Ben Wikler  the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Mark Jefferson  the Wisconsin Republican Party executive director  said changing the election date would have been too chaotic. “We had passed the point of no return from a practical standpoint a few weeks ago ” he said. For both parties  the battle began before the election Tuesday  and before the coronavirus froze the 2020 campaign. Mr. Perez  the D.N.C. chairman  established a voter protection program last year  one of his “four categories” of party infrastructure  and has put “voter protection directors” on the ground in 17 states. The D.N.C. is also involved in lawsuits across the country  ranging from ballot placement issues in Georgia  Arizona and Texas to a delay in changing election procedure in Kansas. In Arizona  the D.N.C. won a case overturning a law that prevented voters from delivering the ballots of their neighbors  a process derisively known as “ballot harvesting.” Ballot collection is also a key part of litigation that the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA has brought in Michigan  where it is fighting restrictions on submitting ballots on behalf of others. Aneesa McMillan  a spokeswoman for the group’s voting initiative  said that the provision could take on added significance as more Americans become homebound and infirm. Republicans were highly focused on stopping Democrats from loosening such restrictions  which they have portrayed as a Democratic ruse to inflate voting tallies. As Mr. Trump put it Wednesday night  “thousands gathered and they come in and dump the location and you lose elections.” In New Mexico  the national party was assisting its local arm in suing to block a statewide postal ballot. And  on Wednesday  the Minnesota Republican Party chair  Jennifer Carnahan  indicated she would fight a proposal by Secretary of State Steve Simon  a Democrat  to move to expand postal balloting  calling it a “power play by Simon to steal the free and fair election process of our state and country.” For their part  public health officials were urging Republicans to drop their resistance to measures that could protect the electorate. The David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A. has joined with the school’s Voting Rights Project to call for “universal vote by mail.” “Everything is about minimizing risk and minimizing exposure ” said Jennifer Kates  director of global health and H.I.V. policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Sending people to go vote in person is really the opposite of that.” She added  “This is bigger than politics.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-disabilities-group-homes.html, nyregion, ‘It’s Hit Our Front Door’: Homes for the Disabled See a Surge of Covid-19, , Supported by  By Danny Hakim The call came on March 24. Bob McGuire  the executive director of CP Nassau  a nonprofit group that cares for the developmentally disabled  received a report from a four-story  colonnaded building in Bayville  N.Y.  that houses several dozen residents with severe disabilities ranging from cerebral palsy to autism. For many of them  discussions of social distancing or hand washing are moot. “Bob  we’re starting to see symptoms ” Mr. McGuire was told. Fevers were spreading. Within 24 hours  10 residents were taken to the hospital. Now  little more than two weeks later  37 of the home’s 46 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Two are dead; nine remain hospitalized. At least eight members of the staff have tested positive as well. “Forgive me if I get emotional ” Mr. McGuire said in an interview  choking up. “People discount people with disabilities and presume they understand them when they don’t know them. They think their lives are not worth the same as yours or mine  and that’s just not true.” As the coronavirus preys on the most vulnerable  it is taking root in New York’s sprawling network of group homes for people with special needs. As of Monday  1 100 of the 140 000 developmentally disabled people monitored by the state had tested positive for the virus  state officials said. One hundred five had died — a rate  far higher than in the general population  that echoes the toll in some nursing homes. Separately  a study by a large consortium of private service providers found that residents of group homes and similar facilities in New York City and surrounding areas were 5.34 times more likely than the general population to develop Covid-19 and 4.86 times more likely to die from it. What’s more  nearly 10 percent of the homes’ residents were displaying Covid-like symptoms but had not yet been tested  according to the consortium  New York Disability Advocates. Trouble throughout the New York City region — and  to a lesser extent  the state — was revealed in interviews with caregivers  parents  advocates and senior officials. In Brooklyn  two parents of adult children in a group home said they were unnerved after another resident died in a suspected coronavirus case. “If it is the virus  what the hell are we going to do?” one of them said  while adding that the staff “deserve a lot of credit” for showing up. On Staten Island  three state employees who are direct caregivers said 50 of their roughly 600 colleagues in the borough had tested positive. They described the challenges they faced on the job. “One of the individuals here is positive  and his behavior is to get up  to pace  and he wants to give me a hug  shake my hand ” said one of the caregivers  asking that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak. “They have a hard time realizing that they need to be isolated  and the psychologists aren’t coming out and talking to him ” he said. “We don’t have training for this. We’re just learning on the fly.” In Manhattan  at the Lexington Parc condominium on East 30th Street  ambulances arrived on three successive days  twice taking away residents of a group home operated in part of the building. Lawrence Smiley  the building’s longtime managing agent  expressed frustration that he had not received more information from the organization running the home. “They’ve refused to tell us anything ” he said  then added: “I’m a realist. Covid is all over the place.” Marco R. Damiani  the chief executive of AHRC New York City  which runs the group home and is one of the state’s largest private service providers  said one of the residents had tested positive for coronavirus  while “the other is back home — it wasn’t Covid-related.” Other homes in his network have been harder hit  Mr. Damiani said  particularly two housing the most fragile residents. Three have died at a home in Jamaica  Queens  and two at a facility in East Harlem. “We still find it hard to get tests for our population ” he said. Protective equipment was also “very difficult to get ” he said  though that situation was improving. Four staff members from his network have died. Jennifer O’Sullivan  a spokeswoman for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities  the state agency overseeing the residences  said in a statement that it had “activated our emergency response team to closely monitor all reports of possible contact within our system across the state.” “All staff are fully trained on infection-control practices ” she said  and the agency “has released guidance to staff and voluntary provider agencies regarding visitation and quarantine protocols at our facilities.” New York’s system of care for the developmentally disabled has become increasingly decentralized in the decades since scandalous conditions were revealed at the Willowbrook State School  a Staten Island warehouse for thousands of residents. While the move toward smaller settings has probably been helpful in averting even wider spread of the virus  the state’s oversight has remained a continuing subject of scrutiny and criticism over the years. In interviews  a number of parents and advocates expressed dismay that the state had not moved more quickly to curtail daily excursions for residents  which continued past the middle of March. On March 16  in internal email traffic obtained by The New York Times  a state nurse expressed alarm to the official in charge of Albany-area group homes. “I have concerns about many of the individuals on my caseload being exposed on the buses and at their day programs ” the nurse wrote. “Are we looking at keeping people home? I was surprised that everyone went to program today as normal!” One of the most outspoken advocates in the state  Michael Carey  whose autistic son was killed in state care in 2007  said the state “unfathomably continued to send vulnerable and elderly residents to day programs” after bars and restaurants had closed. Some advocates also worry that residents may not receive the best hospital care. This week  a leading oversight organization  Disability Rights New York  filed a federal complaint against the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  claiming that state policies treat the developmentally disabled as second-class citizens who will be less likely to get access to ventilators  should there be a shortage. None has been reported  and state officials say new hospitalizations have been declining. Advocacy groups in Alabama  Kansas  Tennessee and Washington State have all filed similar complaints in recent weeks. “A real policy prohibiting discrimination in the allocation of ventilators and all health care must be enacted immediately ” said Timothy A. Clune  the executive director of Disability Rights New York. A spokeswoman for the state declined to comment on the complaint. Few in New York’s system have been hit harder by the virus than Mr. McGuire and his staff. On March 24  he quarantined CP Nassau’s group home in Bayville  a village on the North Shore of Long Island. Staff members were asked to report “with toothbrushes and pillows and hunker down ” he said. “Normal was gone. Our staff are usually called direct service providers — all of a sudden they were lifted up to being essential health care workers.” Mr. McGuire said his organization had a longstanding relationship with Glen Cove Hospital  part of the Northwell Health system: “Glen Cove knows our guys ” he said. But eventually the hospital  like many others  began turning away patients with lesser symptoms. “If they didn’t have symptoms that were life-threatening  they had to go ” he said. “Hospitals got overwhelmed. Nobody’s fault. Who could have predicted this?” As a result  symptomatic residents returned home  probably leading to a further increase in cases. By March 26  Northwell sent over several nurses in protective gear  who moved through the building conducting tests on both the residents and the staff. Arios Eugene  who manages the residence  called it a “scary day.” “They came in — they were dressed in gowns and masks  all dressed up to protect themselves — and went from room to room ” he recalled  adding that the gravity of the situation hit him. “It was real. It was like  ‘Oh my God  this is real. It’s hit our front door.’” Some staff members began crying  and he tried to reassure them. The next day  Mr. McGuire  a former caregiver himself  delivered a message to his staff  his hands resting on the knees of his bluejeans. He urged those who had left to return. “For those of you who haven’t been on the battleground  I will tell you  it’s been difficult ” he said. “Everybody in this agency does saintly things every day.” There were numerous challenges. Fragile residents had to be left alone at hospitals. James Moran  the chief executive of Care Design  which manages the care of residents in homes across the state  has been working with the state to relax such rules for the developmentally disabled. “In many cases they can’t speak for themselves  or have anxiety issues  with nobody there who they know who can support them ” he said. Protective gear was also in short supply at the Bayville home and throughout the system. Mike Alvaro  treasurer of New York Disability Advocates  said that it was a struggle to ensure “that the face masks and the gowns and gloves are there ” and that already stretched budgets were being tested. Oxygen was another challenge. "One day  we were fine  and then we were in trouble and we needed oxygen ” Mr. McGuire said. He consulted with his organization’s board and was ultimately able to buy some oxygen from a local welding company. Many remaining residents who had not tested positive were moved out of the house  into a building used for daytime activities. He grew emotional talking about his caregivers  whose pay starts at minimum wage. He has put up three large signs outside the residence saying  “Heroes Work Here.” “We don’t hear very much about our staff  and they are first responders  they are heroes  and they need to be recognized ” he said. “If we fail  our staff  there’s no backup. We’re the end of the line.” Mr. Eugene keeps himself isolated at home from his wife  his adult children and even his dog. “Every morning when I wake up  I don’t think about it ” he said. “This is what we signed for  to take care of people. We know how to do it — we just have to do it with less people. We're doing the best we can to keep people alive.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html, business economy, ‘Never Seen Anything Like It’: Cars Line Up for Miles at Food Banks, Millions are flooding a charitable system that was never intended to handle a nationwide crisis., Supported by Millions are flooding a charitable system that was never intended to handle a nationwide crisis. By Nicholas Kulish In Omaha  a food pantry that typically serves as few as 100 people saw 900 show up on a single day. In Jonesboro  Ark.  after a powerful tornado struck  a food bank received less than half the donations it expected because nervous families held on to what they had. And in Washington State and Louisiana  the National Guard has been called in to help pack food boxes and ensure that the distributions run smoothly. Demand for food assistance is rising at an extraordinary rate  just as the nation’s food banks are being struck by shortages of both donated food and volunteer workers. Uniformed guardsmen help “take the edge off” at increasingly tense distributions of boxes filled with cans of chicken noodle soup  tuna fish  and pork and beans  said Mike Manning  the chief executive at the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank. “Their presence provides safety for us during distributions.” Mr. Manning  who has worked at the food bank for 16 years  including through Hurricane Katrina  said that he had never witnessed such a combination of need  scarcity and anxiety. “‘Crazy’ pretty much sums it up ” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it ” said Stacy Dean  vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  a left-leaning research organization in Washington  D.C. She has studied food security for more than a quarter century. “People love the phrase ‘the perfect storm ’” she added  “but nothing is built for this.” Feeding America  the nation’s largest network of food banks  with more than 200 affiliates  has projected a $1.4 billion shortfall in the next six months alone. Last week  Jeff Bezos  the founder of Amazon  announced that he was donating $100 million to the group — the largest single donation in its history  but still less than a tenth of what it needs. The coronavirus is everywhere in America  and so is the hunger. More than a million people have viewed drone footage of a miles-long line of cars waiting for food last week along a bend in the Monongahela River leading to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. A spokeswoman for the organization  Beth Burrell  said that 800 cars were served that day. Another distribution this week drew even more. Tini Mason  44  was in one of those cars  making his first-ever trip to a food bank. “We have to stretch every can  every package  everything that we have  because we don’t know what’s around the corner ” he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Mason lost his job as a cook shortly before the outbreak took hold. The career office where he had been looking for work has closed its doors  and he is still waiting for his unemployment benefits to come through. His partner  Crystal Stewart  49  lost her job at a Residence Inn by Marriott  then briefly found work at a supermarket. But she developed a cough and was forced to isolate while awaiting the results of a swab test. (Her test has since come back negative.) Mr. Mason described the sight of mile after mile of drivers seeking food as “an eye-opener  mind-blowing  an experience I will never forget.” He and Ms. Stewart said they honked their horn as a gesture of appreciation for volunteers  then drove home and shared eggs and fruit with neighbors who do not own cars. “If I don’t have to worry about food  I can worry about clothes  how I’m going to pay the rent  how I’m going to pay the car note ” Ms. Stewart said. Close to 10 million Americans reported losing their jobs in the second half of March. The true number of newly unemployed is almost certainly higher  and many have little or no buffer against the sudden loss in income. Even before the current economic crisis  the Federal Reserve found that four in 10 American adults did not have the savings or other resources to cover an unexpected $400 expense. While Congress passed a sweeping economic recovery package last month that promised payments of up to $1 200 to most American adults  it remains unclear when the funds will arrive. Adding to the problem  school closings across the country mean that many families who relied on free or subsidized school breakfasts and lunches to keep their children fed are facing even greater need. The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has begun a special Covid-19 relief campaign. All proceeds will go to nonprofits that provide assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation via GoFundMe. At exactly the moment that more Americans find themselves turning to food charities  the charities are facing shortages of their own. They rely on a volunteer labor force  one that skews heavily toward retirees. Across the country  older volunteers are sheltering at home for their own health and safety — sometimes by choice  and sometimes at the government’s direction. Perhaps more alarmingly  many of the organizations that typically donate large volumes of food have themselves shut down. Restaurants  hotels and casinos have closed across the country. And grocery stores  which ordinarily share unsold inventory that is approaching its best-by date  have less to donate because their worried customers have been stripping so many shelves bare. “When Americans began stocking up on toilet paper  pasta  dried beans and anything else they could get their hands on  supermarkets no longer had that excess  nor the time  to do the kind of shelf sweeps to check what they could give ” said Janet Poppendieck  an expert on poverty and food assistance. She is also the author of “Sweet Charity? Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement.” The result is that food banks are buying what they used to receive for nothing. At Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha  the amount of food donated for March dropped by nearly half. The food bank typically purchases $73 000 of food in a month this time of year but has spent $675 000 in the past four weeks. In New York City  where more than 19 billion pounds of food are distributed under normal circumstances  and the virus poses an enormous test to the system  49 percent of respondents to a recent Siena College poll in the city said they were concerned about being able to afford food. Food banks are large warehouses or distribution centers that supply local storefronts known as food pantries  but also hand food directly to some individuals. They are a relatively recent feature of American life. John van Hengel founded the nation’s first such organization  St. Mary’s Food Bank  in Phoenix in 1967  after a conversation with a woman who looked for food in dumpsters to feed her children. The concept spread around the country  and Mr. van Hengel established the national network that became Feeding America in 1979. The food-banking sector continued to grow in the early 1980s  according to Andy Fisher  a food security expert and the author of “Big Hunger.” That was when President Ronald Reagan cut back on social-welfare programs and a recession struck. Mr. Fisher  who was raised in Youngstown  Ohio  said that with the emergence of the Midwestern Rust Belt  churches  unions and civic associations worked to fill what they believed was a temporary need. “Nobody expected that food banks would continue to 2020 ” Mr. Fisher said. “They grew  they expanded  they institutionalized.” Food banks are distinct from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  formerly known as “food stamps ” which helps recipients purchase their own groceries. Roughly 40 million people rely on the program  though a recent Trump Administration rule change was expected to push 700 000 people from the rolls before the coronavirus crisis began. By Feeding America’s own estimates  SNAP dwarfs food banks as a source of sustenance for needy Americans  providing nine meals for every one from its nationwide food-bank network. But the sudden surge of demand has outstripped SNAP’s ability to process new applications. “It’s a highly flexible system  but it is not a system designed to absorb 10 million people in one month ” Ms. Dean said. The number of people who needed help putting food on the table rose dramatically during the Great Recession. More than 50 million Americans were food insecure by 2009  according to the Department of Agriculture  but the numbers had improved significantly as the unemployment rate declined in recent years  falling to 37 million by 2018. The most challenging events often come in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes  earthquakes or wildfires. But those affect a particular region  and food banks in other parts of the country can step up with immediate aid from their inventory. The latest crisis  with layoffs soaring everywhere simultaneously  will probably test the nation’s food banks like none before. Christina Wong  director of public policy and advocacy at Northwest Harvest  an independent food bank in Seattle  said that the group was using up the food in its warehouse  down to what it had secured during a holiday food drive. The food bank’s bulk purchasing operation  used to paying 25 cents on the dollar  is having to compete on the open market with grocery stores and is starting to have to pay full cost. Her group estimated that Washington State had gone from 800 000 people struggling to put food on the table to 1.6 million since the outbreak began. Before the crisis  Northwest Harvest had tried to create a dignified experience for clients  as close as possible to shopping at a conventional grocery store  with an emphasis on fresh  local food. “We’ve reverted to handing out a box of food ” Ms. Wong said  with macaroni and cheese  canned chicken and peanut butter in a typical container. Based in Las Vegas  Three Square Food Bank previously distributed food through 180 pantries across Clark County. Since the outbreak — and the sudden closing of nearly all of the city’s gambling and tourism attractions — the organization has restructured  with 10 pantries and 21 new drive-through distribution sites. Larry Scott  Three Square’s chief operating officer  said that the group had expected 200 to 250 cars a day at each drive-through. They’re getting up to 500 to 600 cars instead  with lines up to four miles long. “Every day  we distribute everything that we bring to a site ” Mr. Scott said. An initial glut of high-quality food from shuttered casinos is basically gone  Mr. Scott said. Now his food bank is burning through an extra $300 000 to $400 000 a week in cash to buy food. He said that he saw no relief in sight. “What we do today has to be repeated again tomorrow  and the next day  and the next day ” Mr. Scott said. “Hungry people are hungry each and every day.” Ericka Smrcka  an official at Food Bank for the Heartland in Nebraska  went to a recent mobile food distribution at a middle school in neighboring Council Bluffs  Iowa. She and a colleague arrived nearly an hour before it was scheduled to start to find the streets jammed in every direction and the police directing traffic. “We were overwhelmed with tears ” Ms. Smrcka said. “Oh  my gosh. Everywhere we looked  there were just cars.” The delivery truck had enough boxes of food — produce  bread and milk — for 200 vehicles. Some 400 showed up. Ms. Smrcka recalled feeling apprehensive at the prospect of walking car to car with nothing more than a flier describing alternative resources  thinking she might get yelled at. But that’s not what happened. “After sitting in their car for an hour and not receiving any food  they still said thank you ” she said  recalling in particular a father who had left work early and picked up his three daughters  and who departed empty-handed.

By Benjamin Mueller LONDON — The eight men moved to Britain from different corners of its former empire  all of them doctors or doctors-to-be  becoming foot soldiers in the effort to build a free universal health service after World War II. Now their names have become stacked atop a grim list: the first  and so far only  doctors publicly reported to have died after catching the coronavirus in Britain’s aching National Health Service. For a country ripped apart in recent years by Brexit and the anti-immigrant movement that birthed it  the deaths of the eight doctors — from Egypt  India  Nigeria  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and Sudan — attest to the extraordinary dependence of Britain’s treasured health service on workers from abroad. It is a story tinged with racism  as white  British doctors have largely dominated the prestigious disciplines while foreign doctors have typically found work in places and practices that are apparently putting them on the dangerous front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. “When people were standing on the street clapping for N.H.S. workers  I thought  ‘A year and a half ago  they were talking about Brexit and how these immigrants have come into our country and want to take our jobs ’” said Dr. Hisham el-Khidir  whose cousin Dr. Adil el-Tayar  a transplant surgeon  died on March 25 from the coronavirus in western London. “Now today  it’s the same immigrants that are trying to work with the locals ” said Dr. el-Khidir  a surgeon in Norwich  “and they are dying on the front lines.” By Tuesday  7 097 people had died in British hospitals from the coronavirus  the government said on Wednesday  a leap of 938 from the day before  the largest daily rise in the death toll. And the victims have included not just the eight doctors but a number of nurses who worked alongside them  at least one from overseas. Health workers are stretched thin as hospitals across the country are filled with patients  including Prime Minister Boris Johnson  who this week was moved into intensive care with the coronavirus. Britain is not the only country reckoning with its debt to foreign doctors amid the terror and chaos of the pandemic. In the United States  where immigrants make up more than a quarter of all doctors but often face long waits for green cards  New York and New Jersey have already cleared the way for graduates of overseas medical schools to suit up in the coronavirus response. But Britain  where nearly a third of doctors in National Health Service hospitals are immigrants  has especially strong links to the medical school systems of its former colonies  making it a natural landing place. That was true for Dr. el-Tayar  64  the oldest son of a government clerk and a housewife from Atbara  Sudan  a railway city on the Nile. He had 11 siblings  and one left a special impression: Osman  a brother  who became ill as a child and died without suitable medical treatment. Though Dr. el-Tayar rarely spoke of his brother’s death  he gave the same name to his oldest son. “In my mind  I think that’s what led him to medicine ” Dr. el-Khidir said. “He didn’t want anyone else in his family to feel that.” After graduating from the University of Khartoum  Dr. el-Tayar decided to help address a tide of kidney disease sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. So he moved to Britain in the early 1990s to train as a specialist transplant surgeon. He returned to Sudan around 2010 and helped set up a transplant program there. But the deteriorating political situation in Sudan and the recent birth of a son persuaded Dr. el-Tayar to settle back in Britain  where he went to work once again for the health service. Having lost his status as a senior doctor when he left for Sudan  he had taken up work filling in at a surgical assessment unit in Herefordshire  northwest of London  examining patients coming through the emergency room. It was there that his family believes Dr. el-Tayar  working with only rudimentary protective gear  contracted the virus. Sequestered in the western London home where he loved sitting next to his 12-year-old son  he became so short of breath recently that he could not string together a sentence. While on a ventilator  his heart failed him. Had the health service started screening hospital patients for the virus sooner or supplied doctors with better protective gear  Dr. el-Tayar might have lived  said his cousin  Dr. el-Khidir. “In our morbidity analyses  we go through each and every case and ask  ‘Was it preventable? Was it avoidable?’” he said. “I’m trying to answer this question with my cousin now. Even with all the difficulties  I’ve got to say the answer has to be yes.” Analysts warn that doctor shortages across countries ravaged by the coronavirus will worsen as the virus spreads. While ventilators may be the scarcest resource for now  a shortage of doctors and nurses trained to operate them could leave hospitals struggling to make use even of what they have. By recruiting foreign doctors  Britain saves the roughly $270 000 in taxpayer money that it costs to train doctors locally  a boon to a system that does not spend enough on medical education to staff its own hospitals. That effectively leaves Britain depending on the largess of countries with weaker health care systems to train its own work force. Even so  the doctors are hampered by thousands of dollars in annual visa fees and  on top of that  a $500 surcharge for using the very health service they work for. Excluded from the most prestigious disciplines  immigrant doctors have come to dominate so-called Cinderella specialties  like family and elderly medicine  turning them into pillars of Britain’s health system. And unlike choosier Britain-born doctors  they have historically gone to work in what one lawmaker in 1961 called “the rottenest  worst hospitals in the country ” the very ones that most needed a doctor. Those same places are now squarely in the path of the virus. “Migrant doctors are architects of the N.H.S. — they’re what built it and held it together and worked in the most unpopular  most difficult areas  where white British doctors don’t want to go and work ” said Dr. Aneez Esmail  a professor of general practice at the University of Manchester. “It’s a hidden story.” When Dr. el-Tayar moved to Britain in the 1990s  he was following a pipeline laid by the family of another doctor who has now died after contracting the coronavirus: Dr. Amged el-Hawrani  55. An ear  nose and throat specialist  Dr. el-Hawrani was about 11 when his father  a radiologist  brought the family in 1975 from Khartoum to Taunton  a town in southwestern England  and then Bristol  a bigger city nearby. Many Sudanese doctors at the time were burnishing their skills in Britain before returning home or moving to Persian Gulf countries for higher wages. But Dr. el-Hawrani’s family turned their home into a staging post for Sudanese doctors interested in longer-term stays  hosting their families during exams or house hunts. “The more the merrier ” said Amal el-Hawrani  a younger brother of Dr. el-Hawrani. “My mum always liked that.” Being British-Sudanese in the 1980s was not easy. Race riots flared in cities across the country. Mosques were scarce. Dr. el-Hawrani went to school almost exclusively with white British classmates. The young doctor quietly stood up for his family: When someone once tried to kill a 100-year-old fern in their garden by cutting out a ring of bark  Dr. el-Hawrani snapped off branches and nailed them across the gap so that nutrients could get across. Still  discrimination bothered him. When it came time to follow his father into medicine  Dr. el-Hawrani told his brother that he “wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon but felt that maybe because of certain prejudices he didn’t get it.” His resolve only grew stronger after an older brother  Ashraf  a fellow doctor  died at 29 of causes related to asthma. Dr. el-Hawrani discovered his brother’s body. Before Dr. el-Hawrani’s death  on March 28  he had finally come around to the idea that his only son  Ashraf  named in his brother’s memory  would study English instead of the family trade. Ashraf said in a statement that his father “was dedicated towards his family.” “Now he has to make his decisions about which university to go to on his own ” Amal el-Hawrani said of Ashraf. “He was expecting to have his father’s help.” The coronavirus has taken a devastating toll on migrant doctors across Britain  leaving at least six others dead: Dr. Habib Zaidi  76  a longtime general practitioner from Pakistan; Dr. Alfa Sa’adu  68  a geriatric doctor from Nigeria; Dr. Jitendra Rathod  62  a heart surgeon from India; Dr. Anton Sebastianpillai  in his 70s  a geriatric doctor from Sri Lanka; Dr. Mohamed Sami Shousha  79  a breast tissue specialist from Egypt; and Dr. Syed Haider  in his 80s  a general practitioner from Pakistan. Barry Hudson  a longtime patient of Dr. Zaidi in southeastern England  recalled their exam table conversations about England’s cricket team. “He was a big figure in the community ” Mr. Hudson said. “He had a proper doctor’s manner. He didn’t rush anybody.” For families that love to gather  grieving at a distance has been wrenching. Dr. el-Tayar was buried beside his father and grandfather in Sudan  as he had wanted. But because only cargo planes were flying there  his wife and children could not accompany the coffin. At Dr. el-Hawrani’s burial  an imam said a prayer before a small  spread-out crowd  and the doctor’s four living brothers and son lowered his coffin into the ground. Then they dispersed. His brother  Amal el-Hawrani  permitted himself a single intimacy: a hug with his mother  because “I couldn’t turn that away ” he said. Then she returned to her home in Bristol  along with a son who had visited Dr. el-Hawrani in the hospital. Fearful of passing on the virus  he had to forbid her from his room to keep her from bringing in food. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/00virus-immigrantdocs3/00virus-immigrantdocs3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-benjamin-mueller/author-benjamin-mueller-thumbLarge.jpg 
04/2020/interactive,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/05/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-reopen.html, 05 world europe, Italy’s Virus Shutdown Came Too Late. What Happens Now?, , Italy underestimated the outbreak  then ordered a national lockdown to contain it. A month later  officials warn it is still too soon to reopen. Lombardy Veneto Lodi Padua Vo' Milan Venice Turin Genoa Bologna Florence Rome Cagliari Naples Palermo Lockdown Day 1 Italy identified its first case of local coronavirus transmission in a 38-year-old man on Feb. 20. A cluster of cases in Lodi  a province in the country’s north  all appeared to be connected to him. Provinces with reported infections Cumulative reported cases Day 2 Italy’s first coronavirus death was recorded in the neighboring Veneto region. Day 4 As the virus spread  the Italian government created two “red zones” around 10 towns in Lodi and around the town of Vo’ in Padua province  effectively quarantining 50 000 people. Areas under lockdown Officials closed schools  museums and theaters and canceled religious and sporting events  as more cases were reported across northern Italy. Cafes and bars were allowed to stay open until 6 p.m. Day 6 But others  reluctant to fully freeze the region known as Italy’s economic engine  played down the threat of the virus. The mayor of Milan unveiled a campaign  “Milan Doesn’t Stop ” allowing bars to remain open in the evenings. Day 12 Milan’s landmark cathedral opened back up to tourists. Some of the city’s museums reopened  too. Cases continued to climb  topping 2 000 across the country. Day 18 A surge of new cases persuaded the government to lock down much of the north on March 8  restricting the movement of roughly 16 million people. But the order leaked early  and many people fled the area before it took effect. Areas under lockdown Day 20 Nearly three weeks after the first case in Lodi was reported  the prime minister banned all nonessential movement across the entire country on March 10. But the rules of the lockdown were unclear  and enforcement was spotty. Days 22-30 Bars  restaurants and most shops nationwide were finally ordered to close. Factories halted nonessential production. All outdoor activities were banned. Parks were closed. Day 42 The lockdown was scheduled to lift on April 3  but officials extended it because the country was still reporting thousands of new infections daily. In the weeks since all of Italy was ordered indoors — no soccer games  no visiting cafes or bars  no church services — the country made slow progress toward containing its severe coronavirus outbreak. There are signs of hope: Even as the number of cases climbs  the rate of infection has started to slow under the nationwide lockdown. But Italy continues to answer for mistakes made before it took effect. More than 124 000 people in Italy have tested positive for Covid-19  the disease caused by the new coronavirus  since its outbreak began. The country  which has recorded more than 15 000 deaths  now has the highest coronavirus death toll in the world — and it is still rising. Some scientists say that Italian officials did not act decisively to stop the virus early on  underestimating its danger and how quickly it spreads. “We realized the virus was here too late ” said Roberto Burioni  one of Italy’s leading virologists. “It was already spreading.” Any decision to let up now and ease restrictions on movement  public health officials warned  would risk a new wave of infections. “We haven’t reached the peak  and we haven’t passed it ” Silvio Brusaferro  the head of Italy’s national health institute  said at a recent news conference. Recognizing the continuing severity of the crisis  Italy extended its lockdown to at least mid-April  with most government and public health officials recommending that the measures remain in place even longer. “If we started to loosen the measures  all our efforts made so far would have been in vain ” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a news conference on Wednesday. “We would pay a very high price. We ask everyone to continue to respect the measures.” Read more: In Italy  Going Back to Work May Depend on Having the Right Antibodies That message may be tough to hear for the 60 million who have spent the past month confined to their homes and whose patience is wearing thin. But public health experts stress that safely releasing Italy from lockdown will require not only more certainty that the spread of infection has slowed considerably  but also assurances that the country can prevent another immediate outbreak. “There needs to be a robust test  trace and quarantine system in place before you begin to unlock these measures ” said Thomas Hale  a professor of public policy at Oxford University who has been tracking government responses to the coronavirus around the world. “In Japan  we saw a country that thought it had it under control  but might have to go into severe lockdown now.” Luckily  Italy has some evidence that “flattening the curve” of new infections is possible within its own borders. Provinces in the north such as Lodi and Padua that reacted to the outbreak more quickly than their neighbors are already seeing a sustained decline in new infections. They offer clues for how the country as a whole may be able to emerge from its lockdown. By March 8  the government had ordered most regions in Italy’s north to close schools and ban sporting events and large gatherings. A curfew shuttered bars at 6 p.m. The nationwide lockdown that went into effect on March 10 went further  banning all nonessential movement and requiring permission to travel for work  health or “other necessities ” like groceries. Police checkpoints were set up around the country  and those who were stopped had to fill out official forms explaining their movements. These extreme measures appear to have worked: People stopped moving around. Normal travel Half of normal No travel Areas under lockdown Veneto Lombardy After a partial lockdown began on Feb. 23  residents of Lodi province traveled only 30 percent as far as they used to. The national lockdown that started on March 10 halted travel for most people in Italy. Italians cut their travel by more than 50 percent after the lockdown expanded to cover most of northern Italy.

March 14 - 20 The national lockdown that started on March 10 halted travel for most people in Italy. Researchers who studied anonymized smartphone data found that Italians stayed much closer to home after the lockdowns were imposed. In the week following the national lockdown  they traveled 20 percent as far as they used to  on average. (The median person traveled even less: just a tenth of their usual distance.) But by then  the virus had already had ample time to spread. And nearly a month into the national lockdown  Italy is still adding an average of 4 000 new cases per day. Maps: Tracking the Global Coronavirus Outbreak Scientists say that trajectory is expected. Because the virus has an incubation period of up to two weeks  new cases reflect infections that may have occurred days or weeks earlier. That means even the strictest lockdowns will not yield immediate results. “This is the frustrating thing ” Dr. Burioni said. “You have to wait 15 days to see whether there is an effect. In the meantime  you have to just hold your breath.” Lombardy  the northern region where the outbreak was first detected  has been hit hardest: The region accounts for about 40 percent of the country’s confirmed cases and more than 50 percent of its deaths. But Lombardy may also be the first area of Italy to see the lockdown’s positive effects. Local lockdowns seem to have made a difference in slowing the spread of the virus  even within Lombardy. Provinces that moved to limit mobility earlier were able to reduce the rate of infection sooner. Lodi 75 cases per 100k residents Local lockdown 50 7-day average 25 0 March April Bergamo 75 cases per 100k residents Regional lockdown 50 25 0 March April Milan 75 cases per 100k residents Regional lockdown 50 25 0 March April Lodi Bergamo Milan 75 cases per 100k residents Local lockdown Regional lockdown Regional lockdown 50 7-day average 25 0 March April March April March April Lodi Bergamo Milan 75 cases per 100k residents Local lockdown Regional lockdown Regional lockdown 50 7-day average 25 0 March April March April March April Lodi  the province just south of Milan that saw the initial cluster of cases  moved to lock down several towns as early as Feb. 24. The neighboring provinces of Bergamo and Milan did not restrict movement until the national government imposed a lockdown on most of the north two weeks later. Lodi managed to flatten its curve  while some of the other provinces in Lombardy were still seeing an increasing number of new cases per day until the end of March. Giovanni Sebastiani  a mathematician at the Italian National Research Council  said Lodi’s experience showed “we would have probably reduced the spread of the epidemic if the lockdowns happened earlier elsewhere.” Countries around the world will be watching Italy to see whether it eases restrictions later this month and what happens if and when it does. Mr. Brusaferro  the head of the country’s health agency  told reporters that Italy was in the unenviable position of being first in the West: first to see a severe outbreak  first to lock down its citizens and first to decide what comes next. “We must avoid any measure that causes the curve to climb again ” he said Tuesday at a news conference. “There are no studies or literature on this. We are looking into scenarios that have never been taken before by countries that resemble Italy. Other nations are looking at us as a pilot program.” There is no ideal time frame for a lockdown  public health experts say. The growing international consensus holds that once an area sees a sustained decline in case growth — ideally close to zero new cases per day — it can start to lighten restrictions. Italy might start by reopening schools or businesses in certain regions  or by easing up on social distancing rules. The other major consideration is how well Italy can continue to test people for the virus and trace their contacts to prevent a second outbreak. In South Korea  widespread testing allowed health officials to detect infections early and quarantine the sick  even among people who were not showing any symptoms. Public health officials then tracked down anyone an infected person may have had contact with  slowly eliminating further spread of the virus. In Italy  the Veneto region  an area of about five million people in the north  is already far ahead on testing. The regional government there plans to reach 20 000 tests per day this month. Veneto 2 000 tests per 100k residents All other regions 1 000 0 March April Veneto 2 000 tests per 100k residents All other regions 1 000 0 March April Yet scaling up testing is difficult  given the limited availability of tests and the capacity of labs to take samples. And the harder part comes next: tracing the contacts of those who have tested positive for the virus and urging those in contact with an infected person to self-isolate and get tested. Rosalind Eggo  an infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  estimates that for every person infected  public health officials would have to rush to trace anywhere between 20 and 100 contacts each  depending on an individual’s activity before testing positive. There are efforts underway to pursue more large-scale  digital contact tracing  but they are still being developed. For now  keeping the lockdown in place — even for longer than is strictly necessary — is the safest way for Italy to ensure that the virus does not keep spreading. “If we ease up  is it better that we ease up on schools  workplaces or on social interactions?” Dr. Eggo asked. “Which of these interventions are the ones we can relax? That’s a really big question we’re trying to answer. We’ve never been in this situation. It is unprecedented.” Note: Case data comes from the Italian Department of Civil Protection starting Feb. 24. Earlier case data reflects best estimates from local news reports and Times reporting. Cases that are not assigned a province location are not shown on the map  but are included in the national count. The data does not include the cases of two Chinese tourists from Wuhan who traveled in Italy or a person who returned to Italy from China  because Italian officials counted only cases of local transmission. Allison McCann reported from London  Nadja Popovich from New York and Jin Wu from Hong Kong. Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome. Additional work by Josh Williams. An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect figure for the average daily number of new coronavirus cases recorded in Italy in recent days. The country is seeing about 4 000 new cases daily  on average  not 2 500.

Credit...Daniel Dorsa for The New York Times Supported by By Julie Creswell Just a few months ago  Sue Smith considered herself a healthy eater. She ate salads with kale and quinoa. She counted calories. She eliminated processed sugar from her diet. She avoided dairy products. But in the past month  as the coronavirus pandemic made her housebound  Ms. Smith  a writer in Los Angeles  began shopping — and eating — completely differently. During a trip to the grocery store  she bought SpaghettiOs. She threw two large boxes of Goldfish crackers into her shopping cart. And she went all in on dairy. “I’m eating ice cream. Ice cream bars ” Ms. Smith said. “And tonight  I’m making a spinach-artichoke lasagna. There’s so much dairy in it. But I just need the comfort that I get from that food right now.” As the coronavirus shutdowns continue across the United States  two growing trends involving how people eat — the rising amount of money spent on meals outside the home and the increased purchase of fresh or organic foods in grocery stores — have been reversed. Many restaurants have closed  and shoppers are reaching for frozen pizza and boxes of cereal instead of organic greens and whole grains. That’s good news for big food companies like Kraft Heinz and J.M. Smucker  which have struggled in recent years to adapt as Americans shied away in great numbers from highly processed foods. Now  in a moment of crisis  shoppers are turning to old standbys that they may not have had in years or even decades. Many large food businesses like the Campbell Soup Company  which had seen steady declines in soup sales the last two years  are now ramping up production and temporarily increasing wages for hourly employees to meet the higher demand. In the last month  sales of Campbell’s soup soared 59 percent from a year earlier. Prego pasta sauce increased 52 percent  and sales of its Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers climbed nearly 23 percent. Similarly  Kraft Heinz  whose products had fallen far out of favor with consumers  resulting in massive write-downs in the values of its Kraft natural cheese and Oscar Mayer cold cuts businesses a year ago  told investors last week that some of its factories were working three shifts to meet high demand for products like its macaroni and cheese. The company’s stock rose on Tuesday after it said first-quarter sales would be up 3 percent. And Conagra Brands  which had reported a decline of more than 5 percent in net sales for the quarter ending Feb. 23  said its shipments to retailers and in-store sales in March had grown 50 percent as demand increased for Slim Jim jerky snacks  Birds Eye frozen vegetables and Chef Boyardee pastas. “We stocked up on the entire Chef Boyardee line. Chef Boyardee Ravioli. Chef Boyardee Beefaroni ” Ms. Smith said. “I hadn’t had that stuff in 20 years.” Much of the early panic buying that cleared out stores of rice  cans of tuna and soup  and beans was rooted in a combination of fear and practicality. Shoppers  uncertain of when they would be able to return to grocery stores and whether they would find any food restocked  bought foods that could sit on their shelves for months. These simple and easy-to-make meals also fill the bill for people trying to squeeze a fast lunch in between Zoom meetings for work or for parents feeding their newly home-schooled children. For the large food companies  a big question is whether the robust sales will disappear once the shutdown ends. Some of that depends on how quickly the economy rebounds  said Robert Moskow  an analyst at Credit Suisse. “We counted three economic recessions in the past 30 years  and in each of them the data show that consumers shifted more toward at-home food consumption to save money  away from the structural trend of eating away from the home ” Mr. Moskow said. “I would expect food-at-home consumption to increase  and not just for the next two months but for the next 12 months.” Others say the quarantine food shopping provides an opportunity for food companies to convert first-time shoppers into longtime buyers with packaged  refrigerated or frozen foods that they say are healthier and tastier than they were a few years ago. “We’re seeing frozen dinners and entrees that are on trend with simple ingredients and global cuisines ” said David Portalatin  the national analyst for food and beverage consumption at the NPD Group  a research firm. “The food companies have responded to the contemporary food values over the last few years.” Executives at General Mills said they had worked diligently to improve the nutrition level and taste of many products. “Right now  we have people trying the products they haven’t had for a while  and we hope they’re surprised and find that they’re delicious and that we have them come back ” said Jon Nudi  who leads the company’s North American retail operations. General Mills has seen across-the-board increases in its various product lines in the last four weeks  from Yoplait yogurt to Cheerios cereal to Progresso Soup and even baking products like Gold Medal flour and Bisquick as consumers confined to their homes fill the endless hours by trying new recipes or even baking bread. “We’ve seen all of our categories go up  including dry packaged dinner mixes like Hamburger Helper ” Mr. Nudi said. “There were a lot of people who thought its best days were way behind it. But  mixed with hamburger or tuna  it’s a simple and delicious meal.” For many people  some of the strict rules they had around food before the quarantines are now being eased. “We don’t normally have chips at home. But now we have Doritos and Cheetos. Chips made with orange stuff and all sorts of seasonings that we normally don’t eat ” said Connie Huynh  an organizer with the grass-roots activist network People’s Action in Pasadena  Calif. “We are relaxing some of the rules during this stressful time just to get through it.” For others  the food purchases are purely an emotional reaction. Consumers are reaching for foods that trigger a comforting childhood memory or are simply their go-to snack when they need to relieve stress. “One of the first things I grabbed was Kraft Easy Cheese. The disgusting orange stuff in a can. But it was one of the foods I ate growing up  so it’s a nostalgia thing ” said Hana Thompson  who works for a software start-up in Denver. “I also have a bag of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos that I haven’t opened. How long can I last and not eat those? It’s a low-entertainment game that I’ve been playing.” Two days later  the Cheetos won. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/business/08virus-badfood-1/merlin_171304212_fbd5c880-40ed-466f-a0d4-4c8028752684-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/business/09virus-badfood-2/08virus-badfood-2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Natasha Singer  Nicole Perlroth and Aaron Krolik Over the last month  the Zoom videoconferencing service has emerged as the communication lifeline of the coronavirus pandemic. But the convenience fueling Zoom’s explosive popularity has come at a price. Originally a service meant for businesses  Zoom was designed to make it easy for company employees  sales representatives and clients to hop on meetings. When consumers flocked to the video platform for school and socializing  however  those conveniences also made it easy to hijack videoconferences and harass participants in online attacks known as Zoombombing. Now the company is scrambling to deal with privacy and security issues that keep popping up. On Wednesday morning  Zoom announced that it had formed a council of chief information security officers from other companies to share ideas on best practices. The company also announced that it had hired Alex Stamos  the former chief security officer of Facebook  as an outside adviser. Eric S. Yuan  the chief executive of Zoom Video Communications  the California company behind the video platform  said in an interview Tuesday evening that his greatest regret was not recognizing the possibility that one day Zoom might be used not just by digitally savvy businesses but also by tech neophytes. “We were focusing on business enterprise customers ” Mr. Yuan said. “However  we should have thought about ‘What if some end user started using Zoom’” for nonbusiness events  “maybe for family gatherings  for online weddings.” He added: “The risks  the misuse  we never thought about that.” Mr. Yuan said Zoom never felt the need until now to rigorously examine the platform’s privacy and security implications for consumers. “If not for this crisis ” he said  “I think we would have never thought about this.” In addition to the Zoombombing episodes  Zoom has reacted with surprise to press reports that the company’s iPhone app leaked user data to Facebook as well as to criticism that the platform had allowed certain users to covertly access the LinkedIn profile data of other participants. Zoom’s trajectory from mass media darling to privacy pariah may seem like a familiar narrative in a tech industry with a build-it-first  beg-forgiveness-later culture. But the coronavirus has accelerated the Silicon Valley story arc at an incredible pace. The coronavirus-fed boom has essentially forced Zoom to publicly acknowledge and address problems on a vastly shorter timetable than older companies like Facebook. Now attorneys general in several states are scrutinizing Zoom’s privacy and security practices even as the company has publicly committed to improving them. Mr. Yuan said the company had not anticipated the exponential growth in new users during the coronavirus pandemic or the unrelenting public scrutiny that would come with it. Four months ago  Zoom was a niche business tool with 10 million daily users  many of them people working in offices or at home. Today  it has emerged as a fundamental online utility  with 200 million daily users — including family members gathering to celebrate holidays  teachers leading online classes for students and members of Alcoholics Anonymous holding meetings. Last week  Zoom said it was suspending work on features for the next 90 days to devote all of its engineering resources to shoring up its security and privacy practices. Security researchers also discovered that  despite its marketing promises  Zoom encrypted users’ communications but not with end-to-end encryption — a system that prevents third parties from accessing private communications. Mr. Yuan noted that end-to-end encryption was significantly more difficult with many users communicating simultaneously instead of something like Apple’s FaceTime  which is typically used by a handful of people at the same time. Last week  the office of New York’s attorney general sent a letter to Mr. Yuan  questioning whether Zoom’s current security practices were capable of handling “the surge in both volume and sensitivity of data being passed” through its network. Several days later  the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning saying that it had received multiple reports of Zoombombing  including incidents where school meetings were hijacked by strangers posting pornography and using threatening language. Zoom quickly announced that it was removing the Facebook software from its iPhone app and eliminating the LinkedIn data-mining feature on its platform. To hinder Zoombombing  the company just introduced default settings that will require K to 12 schools to individually admit participants to videoconferences from virtual waiting rooms. Mr. Yuan said Zoom was now making user privacy and security its top priority and was shutting down enterprise features that could present risks to consumers. “This is a turning point. We have to raise the bar ” he said. “Whenever there’s a conflict  privacy first.” Mr. Yuan  a former executive at Cisco Systems  founded Zoom in 2011. He has often described the company’s mission as “making video communications frictionless.” Before the pandemic  Mr. Yuan said  Zoom used a number of security measures to identify vulnerabilities  and invited hackers to probe its service for payment awards  through a bug bounty. It also developed security and privacy features that could have prevented Zoombombing. But Zoom left it to business customers  which included some of the biggest names in the cybersecurity industry  to decide how they wanted to configure privacy and security settings. Technologists at those companies vetted Zoom’s code for security vulnerabilities  decided whether their own employees should be required to use passwords to join meetings  and how much of their data should be exposed to colleagues and managers. Mr. Yuan also said the company created certain services  like the features enabling Zoom users to log in from Facebook or access the LinkedIn profiles of other participants  to accommodate requests from enterprise customers. But outsourcing such decisions to business customers created blind spots for Zoom. Some cybersecurity and privacy experts said the time for Zoom to reassess its privacy and security was last year  after Jonathan Leitschuh  a cybersecurity researcher  discovered a flaw that attackers could use to activate a Zoom user’s webcam without their permission. Even when users tried to remove the app from their computers  researchers discovered Zoom would secretly reinstall itself. In its letter last week to Mr. Yuan  the New York attorney general’s office noted that Zoom did not address the problem until after the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a public interest research center  filed a complaint about the company with the Federal Trade Commission last year. Mr. Yuan admitted that his drive to open access to Zoom during the pandemic sometimes moved faster than the platform’s privacy protections. Early in the crisis  for instance  a few U.S. schools that foresaw they would need to quickly move classes online contacted him for help  he said  and he personally set up free accounts for them. Soon after  Mr. Yuan made basic Zoom accounts free for schools. But the company did not have experience working with K-12 school districts  he said  and was not set up for federal privacy laws requiring special protections for students’ and children’s information  noting that the company has had to update its privacy policy for schools several times. Now  however  Zoom has gone even further and signed an extensive privacy compliance agreement with the Board of Cooperative Educational Services for school districts in Chautauqua County  southern Erie County  and part of Cattaraugus County  in New York. The landmark agreement  which Zoom signed on March 31  meets stringent new state privacy rules for schools and could serve as a model for other school districts. Among other things  Zoom agreed to delete any data it had collected or stored about the districts’ students  teachers or principals when the contract expires later this year. Mr. Yuan said his three children were now home doing distance learning over Zoom and he recently asked his daughter  an eighth-grader  if her teacher used certain security features meant to keep out troublemakers. He was relieved when she said “yes.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/middleeast/microloans-jordan-debt-poverty.html, world middleeast, Microloans  Seen as Salvation for Poor Women  Trap Many in Debt, In Jordan  an unregulated microloan industry offers easy money. But with no way to repay loans  many women end up buried in debt  or in prison., Supported by In Jordan  an unregulated microloan industry offers easy money. But with no way to repay loans  many women end up buried in debt  or in prison. By Rana F. Sweis RUSSEIFA  Jordan — Five years ago  Amira Hawamdeh took out a loan for $423 to buy buttons and yarn to make purses and sweaters  and winter blankets to sell to her neighbors. Microloans like the one she used to build a small home business have been hailed as an innovative way to lift women out of poverty  empowering them to become entrepreneurs and contribute to the economy. But three years ago  she stopped working after she developed diabetes and back pain. When her son got sick  she took out another microloan to pay for his medicine. When her husband could not pay the rent  she took out another loan. “I was desperate ” said Ms. Hawamdeh  a 64-year-old mother of seven. Today  she is $613 in debt and fears going to jail. Increasingly  as women in Jordan take out microloans to tackle unemployment and poverty  they are becoming trapped in a system that was supposed to help them. Hundreds of unregulated loan shops operate in Jordan’s thriving microloan market  offering easy credit but also high interest rates and penalties  and the threat of jail if the loans are not repaid. Jordan is one of a few countries that criminalize debt. Nearly 2 000 people  about 12 percent of Jordan’s prison population  are locked up for nonpayment of loans  according to a national report supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Last month  the government delayed the imprisonment of an additional 3 000 debtors to reduce prison overcrowding as part of an effort to combat the coronavirus. Aid workers and advocates say unscrupulous lenders often fail to explain the terms and risks of the loans to borrowers  who are often financially illiterate and may be desperately poor. “It’s irresponsible to give a loan to somebody who doesn’t know the consequences ” said Sara Ferrer Olivella  the United Nations Development Program director in Jordan. “It’s like giving someone an injection  and they don’t know what the side effects will be.” Legal microfinance companies are calling for more oversight to crack down on deceptive practices that could tar the entire industry. “In order not to defeat the purpose of supporting the microbusinesses  there needs to be more regulation ” said Lina Bakhit  chief business officer at Ahli Bank and vice chairwoman of the Ahli Microfinance Company. The problem of poor women being imprisoned for debt has become so pronounced that King Abdullah II called in to a morning talk show last year on Mother’s Day here and urged Jordanians to support them. He personally repaid the debts of 1 500 women  and his appeal raised nearly $10 million to cover the debts of 6 481 other women. Activists and relatives of people in debt have held protests twice in Amman  the capital  in recent months  calling for a repeal of the law allowing a creditor to demand a debtor’s imprisonment. When the economist Muhammad Yunus founded the microfinance bank Grameen in Bangladesh in 1983  setting off a growing trend  the idea was seen as revolutionary. A free-market system that replaced charity with small loans promised to help poor women  and sometimes men  become productive workers. In many cases  women were engaged in cottage industries already  and the only obstacle to expanding their businesses and rising out of poverty was a banking system not set up to provide small loans. The idea spread  the microfinance industry boomed and Mr. Yunus won a Nobel Prize in 2006. In the Middle East  microfinance is still a relatively young industry  and in Jordan it has provided critical help for people who cannot meet the requirements for loans from normal commercial banks. The World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and its partners announced in 2018 that they were providing a $10 million loan to a microfinance institution in Jordan as part of an effort to support small businesses  entrepreneurs and women. Jordan  with an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent  was a ready market. Even for those who have jobs  the average monthly income of $637 fails to cover basic expenses. Nearly 70 percent of microloan borrowers in Jordan are women  one study found. In addition to loans  women who have built successful home-based businesses have usually had financial mentoring  family support and a realistic marketing plan. Women managing home businesses are usually still expected to do all the housework and take care of their children. But for tens of thousands of women  microloans have become virtual A.T.M.s  a quick way to get cash to pay the rent or buy emergency medication. Last year  the minister of social development  Basma Ishaqat  said that at least 9 000 women were delinquent on loans of $1 400 or less. That road can lead to mounting debt and sometimes prison. Fatima Shetawi  who owes less than $706  is hiding from an arrest warrant. Reached by phone  she said she had requested a loan of $600 from Ahli Microfinance. When the company asked her what she planned to do with the money  she lied and said she wanted to open a home-based business. Instead she used the money to pay rent. “We thought it was a solution to help us  a way to survive ” she said. The company did not seem to be concerned about where the money went  she said. “They never came to see if I opened the project or how I used the money ” she said. “The loan officers just called me asking why I couldn’t pay back the debt  and then an arrest warrant was issued against me. Now I’m in hiding.” Ahli Microfinance would not comment on her specific case. Officials with two loan companies who described their practices on condition of anonymity said that they do send loan officers to check on their clients but that they are not always able to verify the clients’ situations. In some cases  they said  women will allow only female loan officers into their homes; in others  the women may have already defaulted on the loans before an officer can visit. Microloans have interest rates ranging from 22 percent to 50 percent  and many loan outfits charge a processing fee of $70 to $280 on top of that. In some cases  the interest rate may increase if payments are late. Hanan Hassan  a mother of four in the central Jordanian city of Russeifa  sat on a thin floral mattress in a nearly lightless room whose cold white walls were covered with mold. Two empty buckets slowly filled with water leaking through the cracked ceiling. A bathroom  separated from the kitchen by a half-built wall  had no running water. Scattered on the floor beside her were piles of papers. “All these are legal warnings ” she said. There were more on her phone: One text message warned of legal action because of nonpayment of a loan. For 15 years  she has taken microloans from six different regulated and unregulated enterprises to keep her family afloat. “It was the only way for us to pay our bills ” Ms. Hassan said. She took out more loans to pay back the previous ones. Rights experts say imprisoning debtors violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  but a few countries  including Saudi Arabia  Egypt and Yemen  still do it. So does the state of Mississippi. In Jordan  a borrower can be sentenced up to 90 days a year per loan. If the loan is not paid off the next year  the borrower can be imprisoned again. Imprisoning mothers can wreak havoc on entire families. “Sometimes a husband divorces his wife while she is in prison  and the family breaks down ” said Dima Karadsheh  a consultant and researcher on gender issues who interviewed dozens of women who were released from prison for debt. “It’s the complete opposite of women’s empowerment.” Ali Suleibi  a legal counselor at the Justice Center for Legal Aid  said the whole microloan industry in Jordan was an example of capitalism run amok. “The absence of financial literacy  the lapse in oversight and the lack of care about the sustainability of home-based projects is astonishing ” he said. “These companies lurk and then target the vulnerable.” From her cold apartment in Russeifa  Ms. Hassan sees no way out. Her husband drives a taxi  earning $10 to $20 a day  while she embroiders traditional dresses  earning about $3.50 a week. Ms. Hassan said her husband had pressed her to take out the loans and is now urging her to start another home-based project to generate income. “He doesn’t understand that for years now ” she said  “we are in this cruel cycle of debt and our future is uncertain.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/world/xxjordan1/xxjordan1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/winston-skip-morris-body-found-1969.html, us, ‘Old School’ Technique Helps Identify Victim in 50-Year-Old Killing, A longtime criminalist in New Hampshire manually plotted the details of one of the victim’s fingers to find a match., Supported by A longtime criminalist in New Hampshire manually plotted the details of one of the victim’s fingers to find a match. By Aimee Ortiz With just two months to go before he retires  a longtime criminalist with the state police in New Hampshire is being credited after using an “old school” technique that led to a breakthrough in a 50-year-old unsolved killing. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office announced Monday that — after several failed efforts over the years — the human remains found in a water-filled pit off Interstate 93 in Salem on Aug. 7  1969  had finally been identified. They belonged to Winston Richard Morris  a Vermont man known as Skip who was 30 years old when he was killed by several gunshot wounds to his head  officials said. Mr. Morris’s remains were identified not through genetic genealogy  which has helped solve a number of high-profile cold cases in recent years  including those tied to the so-called Golden State Killer. Rather  it was through the manual plotting of the details of one of the victim’s fingers  which was done by Timothy Jackson  a criminalist at the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory since 1999. Previous attempts at identifying the remains through fingerprinting or DNA were unsuccessful  officials said. In 2012  the New Hampshire Cold Case Unit requested that the remains be exhumed. It was then that the state police lab “received the fingers of Mr. Morris from the medical examiner’s office ” the Attorney General’s Office said. In January 2013  the office said  the laboratory began processing one of the fingers to try to obtain a usable fingerprint. The efforts to obtain a fingerprint were successful  but no match was found at that time. Then in 2019  as the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the remains approached  the Attorney General’s Office said  the Cold Case Unit approached the state police lab again. Mr. Jackson was hopeful last year  as he ran the one usable fingerprint that had been obtained through various databases  that upgraded computers and algorithms would lead to better results. But he still got nothing. The system wasn’t responding  he said  because the finger in question was missing the top layer of skin  or the epidermis. “That has deteriorated after being in the ground since 1969 ” Mr. Jackson  62  said in an interview on Monday. “So what I am truly looking at in the finger is the dermal layer of skin ” which is below the epidermis. Fingerprints look a little different in the dermal layer  where there are actually two rows of ridges “that ultimately grow out to one” on the top level  Mr. Jackson said. He explained that he didn’t think the instrument he was using was “seeing the ridge detail the way that it normally does because we’re dealing with the dermal layer of skin.” But he knew a way around the problem. “I just go old school  which is very easy for me because I’m old school ” said Mr. Jackson  who is retiring in June. “I decide to plot the individual characteristics  or the minutiae  myself.” Then he ran the fingerprint through the computer again  this time using only the F.B.I.’s database. He saw a possible match. Two other examiners also looked at it  he said  and they all came to the same conclusion: “It is the number 8 finger  which is the left middle finger  of Winston Richard Morris.” “I’m not saying I did something that no one else would have done  because they would have realized the same thing I did ” said Mr. Jackson  who worked at the Army crime lab as a fingerprint examiner for a decade before joining the state police. He also credited upgrades in technology with helping him find the match. “I don’t know if the system’s algorithms were good enough to have picked it up” when the lab tried to identify Mr. Morris’s remains in 2012  he added. “It’s pretty remarkable that he was able to plot out details and that helped him get a match ” Susan Morrell  senior assistant attorney general  said of Mr. Jackson’s work in an interview on Monday evening. Scant details have been made public about Mr. Morris  who the Attorney General’s Office said had been released from prison three months before his body was found. The last known sighting of Mr. Morris was in Burlington  Vt.  on July 25  1969. Ms. Morrell declined to give additional information about Mr. Morris. Attempts to reach the family of Mr. Morris on Monday night were unsuccessful. Praising Mr. Jackson for using the technique he did  Ms. Morrell said she was very impressed with his work  noting that “we had run that print numerous times.” Mr. Morris’s remains were identified last year  just before the 50th anniversary of his death. The authorities have since turned their attention to finding out who killed Mr. Morris. Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.

Both Are Losing., For three weeks  the world’s richest soccer league has been consumed by a debate over whether players  or clubs  should bear the cost of the coronavirus crisis. It has turned so toxic the schism may be hard to heal., Supported by For three weeks  the world’s richest soccer league has been consumed by a debate over whether players  or clubs  should bear the cost of the coronavirus crisis. It has turned so toxic the schism may be hard to heal. By Rory Smith and Tariq Panja LONDON — By Saturday afternoon  after three weeks of impasse  after hearing their morals questioned by politicians and witnessing their clubs start to line up for government bailouts  the players of the Premier League decided to take matters into their own hands. The captains of the league’s 20 clubs  as well as many of its managers and several executives  dialed into a videoconference meeting with the aim of establishing a collective position on a subject that has threatened to turn the English public against English soccer at a time of national crisis. Somehow  as the country’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has started to mount  the issue of whether the stars of the Premier League — the richest domestic soccer tournament on the planet and one of Britain’s proudest cultural exports — should take a pay cut has moved front and center. How soccer — which was placed on indefinite hiatus in England on March 13 — has found itself cast as one of the villains of the crisis speaks volumes not only about the political reality of the game in England but also of the singular role it plays in the national psyche. Now  clubs accustomed to the unyielding loyalty of fans have managed to alienate even their most ardent followers. Players  more accustomed to being seen as heroes  have been accused not only of failing to help their teams stanch losses  but of the much more serious offense of not offering financial support to Britain’s overworked health service. In the space of three weeks  a discussion that started with the question of how the richest domestic soccer league in the world will ride out the economic impact of the shutdown has led to its stars starting their own initiative — independent of their clubs — to funnel part of their salaries straight to the National Health Service. It did not start out like this. Talks over what role the players might have in alleviating the virus’s financial impact on the clubs that pay their salaries began in the middle of March  just a few days after the postponement of the Premier League season. At first  the process was relatively straightforward  essentially a discussion between employers  concerned about a sudden cash-flow crisis  and their best-paid employees. Officials from the Premier League’s London headquarters  acting on behalf of the clubs  and representatives from the players’ union  the Professional Footballers Association  gathered in a virtual meeting room  joined by executives from the League Managers Association  an umbrella group for coaches  and the English Football League  the governing body for the three lower-tier professional leagues. All involved thought those talks had progressed positively enough. The Premier League initially suggested that all of its players take a 15 percent salary cut for the rest of the year; it claimed its clubs needed to save 280 million pounds  or $347 million  in order to make up for lost revenue. The union said it would be able to make a decision only if it saw each team’s financial forecast. They cycled through various suggestions — a 25 percent cut and a 15 percent deferral  suggested by the league; no cuts  but a series of deferrals  proposed by the union. Then they focused on a combination of cuts and deferrals that amounted to a figure of 30 percent  for a year  that could be reduced depending on how much of their losses the clubs could claw back. That seemed to form the outline of an eventual agreement. But on March 31  Tottenham Hotspur followed Newcastle United’s lead and placed most of its non-playing staff on furlough  effectively asking the British government  in accordance with public welfare laws  to pay 80 percent of their salaries for the next three months. The remainder would simply go unpaid. A few days later  Liverpool made the same announcement  before being forced to backtrack. Tottenham’s move was greeted with derision and anger — not just from fans  but from players  too. It was the moment a commercial negotiation suddenly morphed into something far larger and far more damaging to all sides: a conversation  in essence  about soccer’s role and responsibilities in public life. A group of athletes  led by the Liverpool captain  Jordan Henderson  had already been discussing setting up a charitable fund to help the National Health Service. Others  including the Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford  had started private initiatives to help provide meals to underprivileged children. But now  through some trick of the light  what they gave back to society became firmly enmeshed with what they were prepared to give back to their clubs. Many of the players felt that Tottenham’s decision was an attempt to back them into a corner  forcing them to take a pay cut or risk appearing greedy  aloof and out of touch during the pandemic. To some extent  it worked: Two days later  the country’s health secretary  Matt Hancock  urged players to “play their part” by taking a pay cut. Julian Knight  a Conservative Party lawmaker  linked players’ pay to health care workers  saying that “the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution  take a pay cut  and play their part ” given the “sacrifices” being made by front-line workers in the health service. The players  though  did not see the link between those two things quite so clearly. They wanted to help  but wondered if doing so with a pay cut — rather than direct donations — might simply save money for their team owners  rather than benefiting the health service. Their salaries are taxed  after all; any cut would lead to a reduction of income for the treasury  and ultimately  the N.H.S. That situation was complicated by the role of the players’ union  led by its longstanding chief executive  Gordon Taylor  who is thought to be the highest-paid trade union leader in the world. The union works not just for Premier League players; it also represents the interests of the hundreds of professionals farther down soccer’s pyramid. Its concern  in negotiations  was that any agreement with the Premier League might later be copied for use in the lower leagues  where salaries are markedly lower. Its priority was to protect members who could not afford to take a pay cut  or who had already received missives from clubs commanding them to accept a reduced salary. Indeed  Taylor — who has said he will not take a cut in his annual wage of 2 million pounds ($2.5 million) — initially refused even to countenance the idea of players’ accepting a cut  rather than a deferral. The position  put to him by the clubs  particularly those in the lower tiers  was stark: There would be either no cut now or no salaries at all when teams start to go under. By Friday  the battle lines had been drawn. When the parties regrouped for another call  there was little hope of resolution. The Premier League had commanded its clubs not to act unilaterally. A collective solution had to be found to help stem losses that could amount to $1 billion and that had required the league to forward millions in emergency funding to clubs coping with a cash-flow crisis. The union by then had doubled down on its position: Any pay cut  it said in a statement after yet another round of talks  would be detrimental to the health system. Yet again  the fate of the health service was portrayed as a central plank in discussions over soccer players’ salaries. Unsurprisingly  the two sides failed to find any common ground  and so the players decided to circumvent the formal discussions  arranging a meeting of their own. A few days later  they reached their conclusion: The players on Wednesday revealed an initiative called Players Together  releasing a statement that declared a goal of quickly “granting funds to the front line” of the health service. The players must hope that move will not only help in the way it was intended  but also put an end to the public backlash  and to the easy depiction of them as feckless and greedy. But that cannot  at a stroke  solve the problems caused by three weeks of rancor. The players still feel let down by their clubs and unfairly exposed by their employers. The Premier League  and its constituent clubs  must still find a way to cut costs in the face of a looming financial calamity. The players’ union has been made to seem  at least in public  scarcely relevant. Most of all  though  the worry will be that the damage  to some extent  is done. Hancock tweeted on Wednesday night that the players were  in his view  now “playing their part.” Whether the rest of the country remembers it that way remains to be seen. After three weeks of war  it is possible everyone has come out losing. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/sports/08virus-soccermoney1/08virus-soccermoney1-articleLarge-v3.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/arts/east-river-virtual-tour.html, arts, The East River Waterfront Dazzles. Take a Virtual Tour., , With views of the water  skyline  bridges and piers  the promenade encapsulates New York’s history. Our critic walks with the architect Deborah Berke. Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times Supported by By Michael Kimmelman New York’s perimeter  where the land meets the rivers and the harbor  has always been the city’s beating heart. The waterfront has morphed over the centuries  from booming port to waste ground to what it is today  a shifting  contested zone of new parks  ferry piers  aging public housing  infrastructure and upscale development. Its history is the history of New York — just as the water is the city’s sixth borough  toward which  as Phillip Lopate once wrote in “Waterfront: A Journey Around Manhattan ” New Yorkers often look for “inner peace.” Twenty-five years ago  the architect Deborah Berke settled with her family at Gracie Square on the Upper East Side. Ms. Berke founded Deborah Berke Partners  and now divides her time between the Manhattan-based firm and Yale University  where she is dean of the School of Architecture. With her husband  Peter McCann  an orthopedic surgeon in the city  she has long made it a habit to stroll the East River promenade  starting around leafy Carl Schurz Park  where the better part of a century ago Robert Moses  the city’s omnipotent planning czar  ordered up a deck to be built atop the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. This is the latest in a series of architecturally minded walking tours. While New Yorkers take shelter during the coronavirus outbreak  the tours are devised to distract readers and remind everyone that the city is still what it always has been  a glory and a rock. Ms. Berke’s walk is the first to be conducted virtually  meaning over the phone  using Google maps. Our conversation has been condensed and edited. It’s intended to be consumed at home  for the time being. She suggested we “meet” toward the southern end of the promenade  beside a metal signpost of a walking man in silhouette  a portrait of John [Huston] Finley. Michael Kimmelman Who’s John Finley? Deborah Berke He is a former president of City College  where I graduated from the urban planning program. I like that the city named the walkway after him. Finley was also editor of The New York Times. In New York if you dig a little  you always discover some interesting tidbits of history. What’s nice about this southern end of the promenade is that because it sits on top of the highway you don’t hear traffic. You’re walking past trees and the gardens in the park  along the water’s edge. I mostly do this walk in the morning  when the sun is to the east and makes the river sparkle while the tugboats go by. Depending on what the tide is doing  you can get some furious action on the surface of the water. Sometimes I think to myself  if the water were cleaner — and I was a much  much better swimmer — I could swim to where I grew up  in Douglaston  Queens. You associate the water with home? If it weren’t for the water  there would be no New York. As an architect  I also find it meaningful that Manhattan doesn’t end  like many cities  by petering out. It ends because it is contained by rivers and a great harbor — by a hard  crisp edge  which gives the city its physical drama. For me part of the drama is seeing the barges going by  the ferry terminal at 90th Street  the bridges. There are moments along the walk when there’s a plane taking off from La Guardia  a train going across Hell Gate Bridge  traffic backed up on the Triborough Bridge  a tooting tugboat — trains  planes  automobiles. It’s not the New York of monuments. It’s the inner workings of the city  its bloodstream. And walking the promenade is a little like walking the High Line — a long skinny park  so that  unlike in Central Park  you follow a linear path  a kind of narrative. Which on the High Line is the neighborhood. Here it’s rivers and civic infrastructure. Right. So if you look east over the water as you’re walking past Carl Schurz Park  you notice a tiny lighthouse on the northern tip of Roosevelt Island. Cute is not a word I like  but it’s kind of cute. By James Renwick. James Renwick Jr.  the 19th-century architect  designer of the Smithsonian in Washington and St. Patrick’s Cathedral and Grace Church in New York. The lighthouse isn’t his masterpiece. Definitely not! But from the promenade  when you look toward it you also get a view beyond to the ferry stop at Halletts Point and to Mark di Suvero’s giant sculpture at Socrates Sculpture Park in Astoria  Queens — you see the layering of the city and different ways of making. Making? I mean you see the block-by-block building stones of the 19th-century lighthouse  and then this enormous 20th-century steel sculpture and then the complicated loading contraption that is the ferry stop in Astoria. They represent all these different ways of putting materials together  unfolding in sequence. You also see the Astoria Houses in Queens  a public-housing project  on a spectacular waterfront site  built in the early 1950s  which  architecturally  are not very good buildings but reminders of what makes a city like New York great  namely providing shelter for members of our community who can’t provide for themselves. You mentioned Hell Gate Bridge  the great railway viaduct from 1912 by the engineer Gustav Lindenthal. Henry Hornbostel was the architect. When trains go over it late at night  I hear their long  low horn  a very romantic  pleasing  urban sound. And  of course  I love the bridge’s shape. A bowstring truss. Which sits on massive legs. My husband and I like to bicycle to Randalls Island and ride around those legs  which you can’t experience if you’re on the train  but which are part of the bridge’s majesty. That truss is of course what’s most amazing. The shape is so obvious and simple — an arch  boom  done — perfect. Then  walking north along the promenade  you get to the ferry pier at 90th Street. Sometimes I hop the ferry down to 34th Street and walk to my office from there. The pier is nondescript. But what’s interesting to me about it is how people use it differently. In the morning there’s a queue to get on the boats but in the middle of the afternoon old guys are smoking cigars  reading the newspaper  and little kids are looking over the edge and watching the waves lap up on the rocks. A simple piece of infrastructure serves many public functions. The other day my husband and I noticed all the blue-green ropes that hang from the pier as part of the Billion Oyster Project. That’s a project to return oysters to the city’s rivers and harbor  create new reefs  restore the ecosystem. The idea is that oysters help filter the water and the reefs soften blows from large waves  to reduce the impact of floods during big storms. For a long time  the harbor was America’s oyster capital. Ellis Island and Liberty Island were known as Oyster Islands. Almost two hundred years ago  Trinity Church was constructed using oyster-shell mortar paste. At some point pollution killed the harbor’s ecosystem. The ropes remind everybody that the oysters are returning  gurgle  gurgle  doing their job. The city is at work. Having gotten to the pier  the promenade has now dropped down to the level of the F.D.R. The next big thing to see is Asphalt Green. A former asphalt plant from the 1940s  designed by Ely Jacques Kahn and Robert Allan Jacobs  shaped like a giant canned ham. Converted during the ’70s into a recreation center. Moses famously called it “the most hideous waterfront structure ever inflicted on a city by a combination of architectural conceit and official bad taste.” I really love the building. Maybe it’s just a rumor  but I have heard it has survived because the structure is just too dense and massive to demolish — an appealing thought to an architect! It has not only survived: It’s on the National Register of Historic Places. I wouldn’t compare Asphalt Green to the Guggenheim Museum. But until recently it was one of the very few curvilinear buildings in the city. Everything in New York is about right angles. Also  I find it interesting that from the outside Asphalt Green doesn’t tell you anything about what its function is. It’s just this huge  incredible form — resolutely quiet. And I appreciate that it was not designed to be a treasure house or a cultural center but part of the machinery that makes the city function. It’s the sort of building that seems timely now with talk about a new public works program focused on infrastructure  to provide jobs lost to coronavirus  and with politicking in Washington over the imposition of an official anti-modernist  “classical” style for national buildings. Sometimes on this walk I pass another example of a public works project from that earlier era a little farther up the F.D.R. Drive  an old Art Deco power station — again  the sort of architecture that says  “the public deserves no less.” And right next to Asphalt Green  the Marine Transfer Station  a new garbage pier  opened recently. For years everyone who lived in the neighborhood opposed it. Now that it’s here  nobody seems particularly upset  me included. It’s as bland-looking as Asphalt Green is the opposite. It has no architectural merit  except for the giant blue cranes that stick out over the water  which remind me of what the Brooklyn Navy Yard must have been like in its heyday. But I saw the most beautiful thing at the Marine Transfer Station the other day. It was a barge stacked full of containers. A tugboat captain was docking the barge. He would have made Balanchine proud. He could’ve crashed into the F.D.R. He could’ve crashed into the terminal. Instead he parked as gracefully as my grandmother used to put on a glove. Often I will walk past another piece of local infrastructure  the pedestrian bridge at 103rd Street  the Wards Island Bridge  which creates a sort of proscenium opening to the Harlem River. It frames a wonderful view. The walkway itself also goes up and down to let ships pass and I like that these functional structures aren’t always rigid — that they involve movement. Then you turn back home? Which means  walking south  I look a little bit less toward the water and more at the skyline. In the typical postcard view the skyline is seen from the side  from east or west  but in this direction  looking south  it’s an agglomeration of very tall buildings smooshed together. My mother  who came to the city 80 years ago as a teenager to study at Parsons  says the city’s horizon line keeps rising. She means that the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building used to define the skyline  when maybe you could also pick out a church steeple. Then in the 1950s all these square-topped buildings raised the horizon line. And now the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building  while still recognizable  are like middle schoolers standing next to a basketball team. Whether I’m coming from seeing my mother in Queens  or from New Haven on Amtrak  or from south of the city  the skyline today looks entirely different from different vantages in different lights. And all the new tall buildings on the waterfronts in Queens  Brooklyn and New Jersey have changed the diagram of the city. The city used to peak in Manhattan and taper out from there. That was the city’s diagram. Now the rivers have cliffs on all sides. Is that a problem? It’s what it is. But I will say that I like this particular East River walk because the city opens up here. You aren’t hemmed in. You get a view that’s more than 180 degrees. It’s a luxury. There are few places in Manhattan that offer this feeling. What feeling? Peace.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/television/quibi-shows.html, arts television, Quibi  the Incredible Shrinking TV Set, The mobile content app could be a place for innovation  but its first set of scripted shows looks like traditional television in miniature., Supported by critic’s notebook The mobile content app could be a place for innovation  but its first set of scripted shows looks like traditional television in miniature. By Mike Hale The first thing I saw on Quibi was a cross-promotional ad for Charmin. A bright blue papa bear  presumably sitting on the toilet  told an impatient cub that he’d be with him after a Quibi. Maybe two. I had to think about that for a minute  which is a long time when you’re on Quibi. Unfortunate marketing happens  but you might expect a little more attention to detail from a business that’s been gearing up for two years  has raised close to $1.8 billion and recruited J. Lo  LeBron and Steven (Spielberg)  among many others  to make its short-form  mobile-only shows. You also might expect the more than 40 series and documentaries that Quibi premiered at its debut on Monday to make a statement about the creative potential of such shows. Looking at a small but high-profile subset of that content — the service’s first four scripted series  featuring recognizable stars like Christoph Waltz  Liam Hemsworth and Sophie Turner (“Game of Thrones”) — leaves the questions of “Why Quibi?” and “Why now?” unresolved. What the shows do demonstrate is just how agonizingly long eight or nine minutes of television can feel when it’s tying up your smartphone. The mediocrity of the scripted series — three dramas and one comedy — raises a more immediate question: Were they poor choices to begin with  or is Quibi’s “movies in chapters ” as it calls the format  sabotaging them? The need to break movie-length stories into sub-10-minute  self-contained installments has had effects that can be seen across all four series. (On Tuesday  four episodes of each were available.) The premises are not subtle. In “Survive ” Turner plays a woman who — mild spoiler alert — is about to commit suicide in an airplane lavatory when the flight goes down in the wilderness  giving her a new lease on life. “Flipped” stars Will Forte and Kaitlin Olson as a pair of reality-TV wannabes who finance a home-renovation show with the drug money they find stashed in an abandoned house. “When the Streetlights Go On” is a high school murder mystery with “Wonder Years”-style narration  while “Most Dangerous Game ” with Waltz and Hemsworth  is the latest retelling of the original short story by Richard Connell about humans hunting humans. All of the shows scan quickly — you catch on to who’s important and what they’re like within an episode or two. That doesn’t mean they move quickly  though. Situations and stories are two different things  and the staccato rhythm of the short episodes appears to get in the way of moving the stories forward. In each of the shows  the main plot seems to be just getting underway  or about to get underway  after close to 40 minutes. The reason for that  it seems fair to say  is less a failure of execution than a failure of imagination at the beginning of the process. Rather than explore new storytelling forms suited to the cellphone — the way Snapchat and the users of TikTok do — Quibi  on the evidence of these early shows  is taking conventional dramatic formulas and simply rendering them into bite-size videos. That may be exactly the business plan  but as an artistic strategy it’s headed nowhere. In the absence of any interesting ideas about how to exploit the small screen or the short form  the shows employ similar strategies — narration is popular  as are woodenly expository conversations  particularly in “Most Dangerous Game.” (Waltz  as the mysterious recruiter of prey-for-pay  makes his share of the dialogue convincing.) The traditional TV-ness of their approach is demonstrated  in an interesting way  by a slick feature of the interface: the way Quibi shows shift seamlessly between horizontal and vertical formats  always filling the screen. If you hold your phone horizontally  they look better  more handsomely composed  the way the directors and cinematographers shot them. But if you hold the phone vertically  they look more lively and engaging — they gain movement and intimacy because of the old-fashioned  pan-and-scan cropping and editing that’s been done to reformat the images. Ugly  in this case  is more interesting. Quibi  arriving at a time when millions of people are stuck at home and don’t need to watch anything on their phones  is offering introductory 90-day free trials. If that lures you in  the scripted show to watch is probably “Flipped ” in which Forte  Olson and Arturo Castro  as a fey cartel boss  provide some comic energy. Second choice: “When the Streetlights Go On ” which has small-town-noir atmosphere and offers Tony Hale as the adviser to the school newspaper. The trial will also carry you to next Monday and the premiere of a new set of shows including the horror anthology “50 States of Fright ” whose executive producer Sam Raimi might have come up with something new.

It was a brisk Wednesday in early March  a few days before the city shut down because of the new coronavirus  and Mr. Gatien was at La Colombe  a cafe inside the brick warehouse that once housed the Tunnel  the massive nightclub on West 27th Street that is now celebrated as a crucible of hip-hop. “Just the raw energy  the exuberance ” he said  sipping an iced tea. “You don’t see it anymore.” Times change. The Tunnel  a former warehouse where Biggie Smalls and Busta Rhymes once barked out raps to frenzied throngs  is converting to offices and luxury retail  blending seamlessly with the gleaming Hudson Yards to the north. And Mr. Gatien  with his icy demeanor and swashbuckler eye patch  is no longer the “King of Clubs ” as he was hailed by The New York Post in his ’90s heyday. His spectacle megaclubs in the city — Limelight  Palladium  Club USA and the Tunnel — were raking in more than $1 million a week at the time  he said  before a drug trial  which he ultimately won  cost him  well  basically  everything. With his memoir  “The Club King ” published on April 1  he hopes for a degree of catharsis after an epic rise and fall  but also to celebrate a lost New York  when clubs felt mysterious and transgressive  luring the misfits and outcasts from the city’s creative underground  and every night felt like a Mardi Gras on Mars. “It was the last of an era: predigital  pre-social media ” he said. “People didn’t even have cellphones. You really had to go out to find out what was happening.” Mr. Gatien  too  no longer looks quite so swashbuckling  his razor cheekbones now softer  his eye patch (worn since childhood  after he lost an eye in a baseball game in which a broomstick was being used as a bat) now replaced by dark glasses. Wearing a vintage Gaultier spring coat over a black hoodie  with oversize white headphones cradling his neck  he seemed at ease just to blend in. “I like being anonymous ” he said. Over the past two decades  he has certainly accomplished that. Mr. Gatien was acquitted of his drug-racketeering and conspiracy charge in 1998 but was deported to Canada after pleading guilty to subsequent state tax-evasion charges. He now lives a quiet life in a three-bedroom apartment in Toronto with his third wife  Alessandra  and has spent the bulk of the last two decades trying to put his life back together. Over the years  there were attempts to break into boutique hotels  and write an “Entourage”-esque series about a 1990s club kingpin. His splashy 2007 return to the nightclub business — a four-story club in Toronto called Circa  with a campy space-age theme — lasted only a year. But his cultural imprint remains. The actor Dylan McDermott played Mr. Gatien in the 2003 film “Party Monster ” about the gruesome murder of a club kid by a Limelight promoter  Michael Alig (played by Macaulay Culkin). The Tunnel was lionized as rap’s lost city of Atlantis in the 2016 documentary “The Hip-Hop Nucleus.” And a 2011 documentary  “Limelight ” offered a kaleidoscopic look back to that sordid netherworld  but Mr. Gatien was not exactly effusive in the film. “Perched palely on a tall stool  rocking dark sunglasses or his signature eye patch ” the New York Times review read  the gangly club kingpin “remains largely an enigma.” Even so  the memoir provides Mr. Gatien a chance to set the record straight. Portrayed over the years as a genius and a hustler  a megalomaniac and a Sphinx  he is looking forward to the chance to control the narrative for a change. “If you only read The New York Post from 1996 to 2000  then I’m a villain ” he said. “It hurts. I was a hard-working guy who spent nearly 20 years in nightlife in the city.” But  he added  “I was an easy target. I was the guy in the eye patch.” Whatever else you may say about Mr. Gatien  who is 68  he never aimed small. He opened his first club in the mill town of Cornwall  Ontario  when he was in his early 20s and managed to lure a young band from Toronto band by the name of Rush for its opening week  he says in the book. He later moved to Miami  where he converted a nightclub called Rum Bottoms into a discothèque called Limelight  and booked rising acts like Grace Jones and the Village People. In following years  he opened Limelights in Chicago  London and Atlanta  where  he writes in his book  a live panther briefly roamed beneath a tempered glass dance floor. The stunt prompted the ire of a local animal rights organization  but the buzz also lured the likes of Rod Stewart and Andy Warhol  he writes. The New York Limelight  of course  had to go even bigger. When Mr. Gatien first glimpsed the former Church of the Holy Communion in Chelsea  the empty church seemed beyond resurrection. Plaster was peeling off the walls  and dusty mahogany pews were scattered on warped floorboards. It was  in other words  perfect. “I fell in love with that building ” he said. The Gothic Revival church also provided a bump in publicity when a handful of picketers showed up on opening night carrying placards with messages like “Don’t Dance on My Religion ” alongside clubgoers hauling a life-size cross carrying a Jesus figure in a loincloth. Along with goths  drag queens  rockers  leather boys and slumming socialites  the Limelight became the home to the ’90s club kid moment. Arty outsiders and fashion iconoclasts favoring lip piercings and pancake makeup reframed dance-floor revelry as an art movement of sorts — a swirling blend of techno music  Carnival-level costumery and  yes  drugs (particularly Ecstasy). “I’m a good shepherd ” Mr. Gatien said. “I was a shepherd of talent. I always got a lot of gratification standing in the back of the balcony  seeing 3 000 below waving their hands in the air.” At Limelight  he added  “we had people in sequins showing up alongside people in tuxedos coming from a dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If everybody is dressed in Armani  it’s boring. If everybody is super-sequins  it’s boring. The most important thing you can do in a club is to draw an eclectic crowd. In the end  they entertain each other.” Mr. Gatien found success in his adopted city  but he did not find universal love. The Village Voice called him “a bit of a cold fish.” New York magazine described him as “a provincial money man who didn’t make the scene  but made a fortune off it.” Even his staff nicknamed him “the Ghost.” “I don’t know if it’s because I’m a small-town Canadian kid ” he said  “but I’m much more comfortable in the shadows.” The Tunnel  too  served as a clubhouse for a marginalized population in need of one  he said. Located in a neighborhood that was then an industrial backwater  the club provided a safe space in downtown Manhattan for large groups of young African-Americans. As Datwon Thomas  the editor of Vibe  wrote in 2018: “You couldn’t go to the notoriously badass function that took place on Sunday nights if you were faint of heart. Meanwhile  you weren’t a top-tier rapper if you didn’t perform at the perpetually packed venue.” With Funkmaster Flex wrangling talent  big names including Dr. Dre  Lil’ Kim  50 Cent  Missy Elliott  Jay-Z  Nas and Snoop Dogg all played Sunday night at the Tunnel. And they played for free  Mr. Gatien said  because  well  it was Sunday night at the Tunnel. It was the days before bottle service  and the Tunnel was also a place for the elites of rap to scale the heights of conspicuous consumption. Leaning over the massive bar at the center of the room  Sean Combs and Jermaine Dupri used to compete to see who could line up more empty Cristal bottles  Mr. Gatien writes in the book. “Everybody was dancing ” Mr. Gatien said. “Even the security girls  once the rush was over. And when everybody was leaving the place  there were so many smiles.” He remembers thinking  he said  that everyone who had been at the club was going to have sex that night. It would not last  however. None of it would. “The owner of three of Manhattan’s largest nightclubs was accused yesterday of turning two of them — the Limelight and the Tunnel — into virtual drug supermarkets ” The New York Times reported on May 16  1996  “peddling the drug known as Ecstasy to a clientele made up largely of college students and teen-agers.” Mr. Gatien does not deny the Ecstasy use in his clubs; the drug was everywhere in the ’90s nightlife  he said. “Was it looser than it should have been?” Mr. Gatien said. “Truthfully  yeah. Was it looser than anywhere else in town? No  absolutely not.” “My mind-set was  the drug wasn’t good for business  in that people don’t drink on Ecstasy ” he said. “But people don’t fight on Ecstasy  either  so it’s not like you’re having blood baths like with people drinking too much tequila.” Nonetheless  his own drug use was starting to spiral. Mr. Gatien  who was then living with Alessandra and his two daughters in a handsome townhouse on East 63rd Street  off Fifth Avenue  made a point of staying clean during work hours. But he eventually succumbed to the temptation and business pressures. At times he would book a $1 000-a-night Manhattan hotel suite and spend a weekend freebasing cocaine naked with a group of “party girls.” “It was total selfishness ” he said. “I’m not justifying it  but the way I looked at it then  I was in an industry where I didn’t have time to take 10 days to go off to California to unwind. In my mind  I’d just bang it out for two days  then go back to work.” When police raided the Limelight in the fall of 1995  his empire was living on borrowed time. As the investigation widened  undercover agents were soon swarming Limelight  some  he writes in the book  dressed in highly unconvincing drag  or wearing dog collars. After his arrest  the legal odyssey lasted two and a half years until he was acquitted of all drug charges in 1998. Jurors “clearly rejected the testimony of a drug-dealing former club director and five other dealers who pleaded guilty to drug-conspiracy charges and agreed to testify against Mr. Gatien in return for leniency ” The Times reported. Even so  the government found a way to get rid of him  deporting him to Toronto in 2003 after his guilty plea to state tax evasion charges. (He paid some club employees in cash.) On visits to New York in the ensuing years  he has made a point of avoiding the former Limelight church  which over the years has housed boutiques  restaurants and a gym. “It’s very emotional for me ” he said. “I had it for almost 20 years. That’s like an eternity in the nightclub business. Most clubs — a year and a half  two years  and that’s it.” While he has entertained the idea of getting an investment group together and creating a boutique hotel  with the Limelight building as the lobby  he will never return to the nightclub business  he said. “I’ve been approached by Vegas ” he said. “I don’t even respond to the calls. It’s a young man’s game.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/fashion/02gatien6/02gatien6-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/john-prine-dead-coronavirus.html, arts music, John Prine  Who Chronicled the Human Condition in Song  Dies at 73, A singer and songwriter with a raspy voice and a gift for offbeat humor  he was revered by his peers  including Bob Dylan. He died of the coronavirus., Supported by Those we’ve lost A singer and songwriter with a raspy voice and a gift for offbeat humor  he was revered by his peers  including Bob Dylan. He died of the coronavirus. By William Grimes This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. John Prine  the raspy-voiced country-folk singer whose ingenious lyrics to songs by turns poignant  angry and comic made him a favorite of Bob Dylan  Kris Kristofferson and others  died on Tuesday in Nashville. He was 73. The cause was complications of the coronavirus  his family said. Mr. Prine underwent cancer surgery in 1998 to remove a tumor in his neck identified as squamous cell cancer  which had damaged his vocal cords. In 2013  he had part of one lung removed to treat lung cancer. He had been hospitalized since late last month. Mr. Prine was a relative unknown in 1970 when Mr. Kristofferson heard him play one night at a Chicago club called the Earl of Old Town  dragged there by the singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. Mr. Kristofferson was performing in Chicago at the time at the Quiet Knight. Mr. Prine treated him to a brief after-hours performance of material that  Mr. Kristofferson later wrote  “was unlike anything I’d heard before.” A few weeks later  when Mr. Prine was in New York  Mr. Kristofferson invited him onstage at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village  where he was appearing with Carly Simon  and introduced him to the audience. “No way somebody this young can be writing so heavy ” he said. “John Prine is so good  we may have to break his thumbs.” The record executive Jerry Wexler  who was in the audience  signed Mr. Prine to a contract with Atlantic Records the next day. Music writers at the time were eager to crown a successor to Mr. Dylan  and Mr. Prine  with his nasal  sandpapery voice and literate way with a song  came ready to order. His debut album  called simply “John Prine” and released in 1971  included songs that became his signatures. Some gained wider fame after being recorded by other artists. They included “Sam Stone ” about a drug-addicted war veteran (with the unforgettable refrain “There’s a hole in Daddy’s arm where all the money goes”); “Hello in There ” a heart-rending evocation of old age and loneliness; and “Angel From Montgomery ” the hard-luck lament of a middle-aged woman dreaming about a better life  later made famous by Bonnie Raitt. “He’s a true folk singer in the best folk tradition  cutting right to the heart of things  as pure and simple as rain ” Ms. Raitt told Rolling Stone in 1992. Mr. Dylan  listing his favorite songwriters in a 2009 interview  put Mr. Prine front and center. “Prine’s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism ” he said. “Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs.” John Prine was born on Oct. 10  1946  in Maywood  Ill.  a working-class suburb of Chicago  to William and Verna (Hamm) Prine. His father  a tool-and-die maker at the American Can Company  and his mother had moved from the coal town of Paradise  Ky.  in the 1930s. Mr. Prine later wrote a ruefully bitter song titled “Paradise ” in which he sang: The coal company came with the world’s largest shovel And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land Well  they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man John grew up in a country music-loving family. He learned guitar as a young teenager from his grandfather and brother and began writing songs. After graduating from high school  he worked for the Post Office for two years before being drafted into the Army  which sent him to West Germany in charge of the motor pool at his base. After being discharged  he resumed his mail route  in and around his hometown  composing songs in his head. “I always likened the mail route to a library with no books ” he wrote on his website. “I passed the time each day making up these little ditties.” Reluctantly  he took the stage for the first time at an open-mic night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg  where his performance met with profound silence from the audience. “They just sat there ” Mr. Prine later wrote. “They didn’t even applaud  they just looked at me.” Then the clapping began. “It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions ” he wrote. “And to find that out all at once was amazing.” Not long after  Roger Ebert  the film critic for The Chicago Sun-Times  wandered into the club while Mr. Prine was performing. He liked what he heard and wrote Mr. Prine’s first review  under the headline “Singing Mailman Who Delivers a Powerful Message in a Few Words.” “He appears onstage with such modesty he almost seems to be backing into the spotlight ” Mr. Ebert wrote. “He sings rather quietly  and his guitar work is good  but he doesn’t show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two  even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you.” Mr. Prine had a particular gift for offbeat humor  reflected in songs like “Jesus  the Missing Years ” “Some Humans Ain’t Human ” “Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone” and the antiwar screed “Your Flag Decal Won’t Get You Into Heaven Anymore.” “I guess what I always found funny was the human condition ” he told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in 2013. “There is a certain comedy and pathos to trouble and accidents.” After recording several albums for Atlantic and Asylum  he started his own label  Oh Boy Records  in 1984. He never had a hit record  but he commanded a loyal audience that ensured steady if modest sales for his albums and a durable concert career. In 1992  his album “The Missing Years ” with guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen  Tom Petty and other artists  won a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk recording. He received a second Grammy in the same category in 2006 for the album “Fair and Square.” Mr. Prine  who lived in Nashville  was divorced twice. He is survived by his wife  Fiona Whelan Prine  a native of Ireland whom he married in 1996; three sons  Jody  Jack and Tommy; two brothers  Dave and Billy; and three grandchildren. In 2017  Mr. Prine published “John Prine Beyond Words ” a collection of lyrics  guitar chords  commentary and photographs from his own archive. In 2019  he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame  and his album “Tree of Forgiveness” was nominated for a Grammy for best Americana album. It was his 19th album and his first of original material in more than a decade. (The award went to Brandi Carlile  for “By the Way  I Forgive You.”) Mr. Prine went on tour in 2018 to promote “Tree of Forgiveness ” and after a two-night stand at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville — known there as the mother church of country music — Margaret Renkl  a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times  wrote  under the headline “American Oracle”: “The mother church of country music  where the seats are scratched-up pews and the windows are stained glass  is the place where the new John Prine — older now  scarred by cancer surgeries  his voice deeper and full of gravel — is most clearly still the old John Prine: mischievous  delighting in tomfoolery  but also worried about the world.” In December  he was chosen to receive a 2020 Grammy for lifetime achievement. As a songwriter  Mr. Prine was prolific and quick. In the early days  he would sometimes dash off a song while driving to a club. “Sometimes  the best ones come together at the exact same time  and it takes about as long to write it as it does to sing it ” he told the poet Ted Kooser in an interview at the Library of Congress in 2005. “They come along like a dream or something  and you just got to hurry up and respond to it  because if you mess around  the song is liable to pass you by.” Caryn Ganz and Neil Vigdor contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/obituaries/09prine1/merlin_36473839_a6429490-8597-41fe-a497-0e482cfd32de-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Its Propaganda Fight Is Not., , After the pandemic subsides  whether Beijing is praised or pilloried could determine the fate of its ambitions for global leadership. Medical workers from a hospital in eastern China cheered as they prepared to leave Wuhan after the lockdown was lifted on Wednesday.Credit...Roman Pilipey/EPA  via Shutterstock Supported by By Vivian Wang HONG KONG — For months the Chinese government’s propaganda machine had been fending off criticism of Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak  and finally  it seemed to be finding an audience. Voices from the World Health Organization to the Serbian government to the rapper Cardi B hailed China’s approach as decisive and responsible. But China could not savor the praise for long. In recent days  foreign leaders  even in friendly nations like Iran  have questioned China’s reported infections and deaths. A top European diplomat warned that China’s aid to the continent was a mask for its geopolitical ambitions  while a Brazilian official suggested the pandemic was part of China’s plan to “dominate the world." As the pandemic unleashes the worst global crisis in decades  China has been locked in a public relations tug-of-war on the international stage. China’s critics  including the Trump administration  have blamed the Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership for exacerbating the outbreak by initially trying to conceal it. But China is trying to rewrite its role  leveraging its increasingly sophisticated global propaganda machine to cast itself as the munificent  responsible leader that triumphed where others have stumbled. What narrative prevails has implications far beyond an international blame game. When the outbreak subsides  governments worldwide will confront crippled economies  unknown death tolls and a profound loss of trust among many of their people. Whether Beijing can step into that void  or is pilloried for it  may determine the fate of its ambitions for global leadership. “I think that the Chinese remain very fearful about what will happen when we finally all get on top of this virus  and there is going to be an investigation of how it started ” said Bonnie Glaser  the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They’re just trying to repair the damage that was done very early on to China’s reputation.” The crux of China’s narrative is its numbers. Since late March  the country has consistently reported zero or single-digit new local infections  and on Wednesday  it lifted its lockdown in Wuhan  where the outbreak began. In all  the country has reported nearly 84 000 infections and about 3 300 deaths — a stark contrast to the United States  which has reported more than 399 000 infections  and Spain and Italy  each with more than 135 000. The numbers prove  China insists  that its response was quick and responsible  and its tactics a model for the rest of the world. During a visit last month to Wuhan  China’s top leader  Xi Jinping  said that “daring to fight and daring to win is the Chinese Communist Party’s distinct political character  and our distinct political advantage.” Chinese officials have specifically compared their response to that of the United States  which has reported dire shortages of testing kits and ventilators. “While China set an example and bought precious time for the world with huge efforts and sacrifice  as the W.H.O.  foreign leaders  experts and media say  did a certain country make full use of the time to enhance preparedness?” Hua Chunying  a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry  said last week. While the numbers are core to China’s narrative  they have also been perhaps its most vulnerable aspect. Public health experts agree that China is undercounting its victims. The same is true in the United States  Italy and any country hard-hit by the virus. But concerns about China’s accuracy are particularly acute  given the government’s history of concealing unfavorable news. Caixin  a respected Chinese newsmagazine  recently reported that a truck driver brought thousands of urns to just one funeral home in Wuhan  though it was unclear if the urns were used for coronavirus victims only  or more broadly. China for weeks also flouted guidance from the W.H.O.  which recommends that countries include asymptomatic patients in their official counts. Officials only began partially reporting them on April 1  bowing to public pressure. In addition  American news outlets recently reported that the C.I.A. had been warning the White House since at least early February that China’s infection count was unreliable  though the basis for the C.I.A.’s skepticism was unclear. And on Sunday  a spokesman for Iran’s health ministry joined the chorus  calling China’s reported numbers “a bitter joke.” Chinese officials have called the accusations “immoral slanders.” They suggested that the United States was casting doubt on China to distract from the fact that American officials had also ignored early warnings from experts. “We sympathize with Americans  as they are facing a severe situation  and I can imagine why some in the United States are trying so hard to shift the blame ” Ms. Hua said. While China’s propaganda might usually be dismissed as just that  especially in developed  democratic countries  the errors in those countries’ responses have allowed it to gain more of a toehold than usual  said Yanzhong Huang  who leads the global health center at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “The complacency  the lack of action  the efforts to downplay the serious of the problem by our own governments — we’ve seen these developments actually help China to make a strong case that they are not the cause of the problem ” he said. It is also true that the Chinese government’s strict  top-down response helped stop the outbreak more successfully than in many other countries  experts said. And some of its efforts to defend its response are justified: When the Wuhan lockdown was first imposed  overseas public health experts and policymakers called it draconian and doomed to fail. But many have since concurred that  in the absence of widespread testing  a cure or a vaccine  harsh restrictions on people’s movement are key to slowing transmission. Beijing has leaned into that approbation in its propaganda push  saying it promptly alerted the world to the threat of the virus. But its narrative is oversimplified  leaving out the ways in which it played down the epidemic. In January  Ms. Hua was comparing it to the flu and accusing the United States of fear-mongering when it began evacuating citizens from Wuhan. When Italy suspended flights to and from China  a senior Chinese official summoned the Italian ambassador to criticize the “overreaction.” In early February  Ms. Hua was already announcing that China had “effectively contained the cross-border spread” of the virus  a position echoed by Chinese state media. Italy and the United States are now among the countries hardest hit by the virus. And China in late March decided to seal its own borders  barring practically all foreigners and leaving even Chinese citizens with little way to get home. Even some of China’s less heavy-handed attempts to claim global leadership have drawn scrutiny. Though China says it has supplied medical equipment to 120 countries  officials in Italy have said that many of the so-called gifts are actually exports. Other countries have complained of faulty test kits and masks. The European Union’s top diplomat  Josep Borrell  warned in an unusually blunt blog post that China was seeking to use the “politics of generosity” to undermine European solidarity. That China’s messaging push has drawn such forceful reactions from some world leaders speaks  in part  to its strength. While other countries’ bungled responses have amplified its message  China’s global propaganda machine has also grown increasingly sophisticated. The government has invested billions of dollars into its foreign media presence  producing slick videos that are not obviously the work of the Chinese government. When Cardi B praised China’s containment measures  she cited a documentary about the lockdown in Wuhan — which many have suggested was a piece produced by the state-run China Global Television Network  with English narration and subtitles. And while China’s propaganda efforts have drawn criticism from some foreign officials  others have remained silent. Countries may be especially reluctant to antagonize China now  given it is the world’s largest manufacturer of desperately needed medical gear — gifted or exported  said Steve Tsang  director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Some critics have already backtracked: After a furious response from the Chinese ambassador to Iran  the Iranian official who called China’s numbers a joke tweeted that China’s support of Iran would “never be forgotten.” The Brazilian official who accused China of maneuvering for world domination later deleted his Twitter post  which had also mocked Chinese accents  after similar backlash. China is the biggest trading partner for both Iran and Brazil. If other countries manage to bring their outbreaks under control  they may begin pushing harder against China’s narrative  said Professor Huang  from Seton Hall University. But China  recognizing the stakes  is unlikely to back down. “History is unfortunately written by the victor  and the coronavirus outbreak is no exception ” he said. Claire Fu contributed research.

Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.

He’s Not Alone., Critics say the World Health Organization was too trusting of China and did not push it on its early missteps. But supporters say the agency’s powers over any government are limited., Supported by Critics say the World Health Organization was too trusting of China and did not push it on its early missteps. But supporters say the agency’s powers over any government are limited. By Javier C. Hernández President Trump unleashed a tirade against the World Health Organization on Tuesday  accusing it of acting too slowly to sound the alarm about the coronavirus. It was not the first time in this pandemic that the global health body has faced such criticism. Government officials  health experts and analysts have in recent weeks raised concerns about how the organization has responded to the outbreak. In Japan  Taro Aso  the deputy prime minister and finance minister  recently noted that some people have started referring to the World Health Organization as the “Chinese Health Organization” because of what he described as its close ties to Beijing. Taiwanese officials say the W.H.O. ignored its early warnings about the virus because China refuses to allow Taiwan  a self-governing island it claims as its territory  to become a member. Critics say the W.H.O. has been too trusting of the Chinese government  which initially tried to conceal the outbreak in Wuhan. Others have faulted the organization and its leader  Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  for moving too slowly in declaring a global health emergency. The W.H.O.  a United Nations agency  has defended its response  saying on Wednesday that it alerted the world to the threat posed by the virus in a timely manner and that it was “committed to ensuring all member states are able to respond effectively to this pandemic.” The agency’s defenders say that its powers over any individual government are limited  and that it has done the best it can in dealing with a public health threat with few precedents in history. There will be time later to assess successes and failings  “this virus and its shattering consequences ” the United Nations secretary general  António Guterres  said Wednesday in a statement praising the W.H.O. as “absolutely critical” to vanquishing Covid-19. Here’s why the organization is coming under attack. When cases of a mysterious viral pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan in December  Chinese health officials silenced whistle-blowers and repeatedly played down the severity of the outbreak. Even as late as mid-January  as the virus spread beyond China’s borders  Chinese officials described it as “preventable and controllable” and said there was no evidence it could be transmitted between humans on a broad scale. The W.H.O. endorsed the government’s claims  saying in mid-January  for example  that human-to-human transmission had not been proven. Critics say the organization’s repeated deference to Beijing exacerbated the spread of the disease. A group of international experts was not allowed to visit Wuhan until mid-February. “They could have been more forceful  especially in the initial stages in the crisis when there was a cover-up and there was inaction ” said Yanzhong Huang  a global health expert specializing in China at Seton Hall University. Mr. Huang noted that during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003  which killed more than 700 people worldwide  the W.H.O. pushed the Chinese government to be more transparent by publicly criticizing it for trying to conceal the outbreak. At one point during the SARS epidemic  officials at hospitals in Beijing forced SARS patients into ambulances and drove them around to avoid their being seen by a visiting delegation of W.H.O. experts  according to reports at the time. Even as the virus spread to more than half a dozen countries and forced China to place parts of Hubei Province under lockdown in late January  the W.H.O. was reluctant to declare it a global health emergency. W.H.O. officials said at the time that a committee that discussed the epidemic was divided on the question of whether to call it an emergency  but concluded that it was too early. One official added that they weighed the impact such a declaration might have on the people of China. After the United States announced a ban on most foreign citizens who had recently visited China  the W.H.O. again seemed to show deference to Chinese officials  saying that travel restrictions were unnecessary. The group officially called the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. Some experts argue that the institution’s delay in making such declarations deprived other countries of valuable time to prepare hospitals for an influx of patients. “It reinforced the reluctance to take early strong measures before the catastrophe had actually landed on other shores ” said François Godement  senior adviser for Asia at Institut Montaigne  a nonprofit group in Paris. “The W.H.O.’s tardiness or reluctance to call out the problem in full helped those who wanted to delay difficult decisions." The W.H.O. defended its actions  saying on Wednesday that it had “alerted member states to the significant risks and consequences of Covid-19 and provided them with a continuous flow of information” ever since Chinese officials first reported the outbreak on Dec. 31. Mr. Guterres of the United Nations said  “It is possible that the same facts have had different readings by different entities.” He added in his statement  “Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic  there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe  and how all those involved reacted to the crisis.” China’s leader  Xi Jinping  has made it a priority to strengthen Beijing’s clout at international institutions  including the W.H.O.  seeing the American-dominated global order as an impediment to his country’s rise as a superpower. China contributes only a small fraction of the W.H.O.’s $6 billion budget  while the United States is one of its main benefactors. But in recent years  Beijing has worked in other ways to expand its influence at the organization. The government has lobbied the W.H.O. to promote traditional Chinese medicine  which Mr. Xi has worked to harness as a source of national pride and deployed as a soft-power tool in developing countries  despite skepticism from some scientists about its effectiveness. Last year  the W.H.O. offered an endorsement of traditional Chinese medicine  including it in its influential medical compendium. The move was roundly criticized by animal rights activists  who argued that it could contribute to a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife whose parts are used in Chinese remedies. China has sought to promote traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of symptoms of the coronavirus both at home and abroad. Last month  the W.H.O. was criticized after it removed a warning against taking traditional herbal remedies to treat the coronavirus from its websites in mainland China. China’s role at the W.H.O. will probably continue to grow in the coming years  especially if Western governments retreat from the organization  as Mr. Trump has threatened. “This is part of China’s efforts to more actively engage in international institutions ” said Mr. Huang  the global health expert. “It will not please every country or every actor  but it’s going to affect the agenda of the W.H.O.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/middleeast/syria-assad-chemical-weapons.html, world middleeast, Syria Used Chemical Weapons 3 Times in One Week  Watchdog Says, An investigative team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons accused the Syrian government of launching three chemical attacks on one village in 2017., Supported by An investigative team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons accused the Syrian government of launching three chemical attacks on one village in 2017. By Ben Hubbard BEIRUT  Lebanon — An investigative team with the international group that monitors compliance with the chemical weapons ban accused the Syrian government on Wednesday of having launched three chemical weapons attacks on one village in northern Syria in March 2017  sickening scores of people. The team  established by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  said in a report that in the span of one week  Syrian fighter jets had twice dropped bombs containing sarin nerve agent on the village and a helicopter had targeted its hospital with a cylinder containing chlorine. Reports of chemical weapons use have surfaced frequently during Syria’s nine-year civil war  and officials from the United States  Turkey and other countries have accused the Syrian government of using banned weapons to try to break the back of the rebel movement that is seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad. The O.P.C.W. verified the use of chemical weapons in many of these cases  but had refrained from assigning blame for who deployed them  raising criticism from activists that holding back such judgments diminished the chances for accountability. So the organization established an investigative body  known as the Investigation and Identification Team  that was assigned to determine responsibility for chemical weapons use in Syria. The report on Wednesday was the team’s first  and it pointed the finger at Mr. al-Assad’s forces. The team based its investigation on a range of evidence  including witness testimonies  videos  forensic reports on recovered munitions scraps  medical records and satellite imagery  the report said. While acknowledging reports of dozens of chemical attacks in Syria  the report focused on three  in the rebel-held village of Ltamenah in northern Syria during the last week of March 2017. On March 24  the team found  a Syrian fighter jet dropped a bomb carrying sarin on the village  sickening 16 people. The next day  a Syrian military helicopter dropped a cylinder containing chlorine on the village’s hospital  which crashed through the roof  released its noxious fumes and sickened 30 people. On March 30  a Syrian fighter jet dropped another bomb on the village containing sarin  sickening at least 60 people. Sarin is a banned nerve agent  and its use is considered a war crime. While chlorine has legal uses in industry and cleaning  its use as a chemical weapon also is considered a war crime. The investigative team said it had examined alternative possibilities for each attack  including claims by the governments of Syria and Russia  a close Syrian ally  that the attacks had been staged by anti-government activists to demonize Mr. al-Assad’s government. But the team called its conclusions “the only ones that could be reasonably reached from the information obtained.” Such attacks  the team’s report said  could only be carried out based on orders from “the highest levels” of the Syrian military. But names of those believed responsible were redacted from the public version of the report. Despite the mounting evidence of repeated chemical weapons use by Mr. al-Assad’s forces  little has been done by the international community to hold them or their leaders accountable. But Wednesday’s report provided some consolation to survivors of the attacks it described. “Until today  my bones  my eyes are hurting ” said Ahmad al-Rahmoun  who passed out after breathing in gas from the attack on March 30. But he wondered why it had taken so long for an international body to assign blame. “Why did they wait until today to accuse Bashar?” he said of Mr. al-Assad  calling for him to be prosecuted as well as “all the pilots behind such attacks.” The Syrian government has denied throughout the war that its forces have used chemical weapons while accusing rebels and anti-government activists of faking attacks to generate international sympathy. Russia and Iran  another strong ally of Mr. al-Assad  have backed his denials. The O.P.C.W. team said in its report it had received no cooperation from the Syrian government in its investigation  nor was it able to visit the attack sites. The Syrian government did not immediately comment on the findings. The United States  a strong supporter of the team’s investigation  welcomed the report as a demonstration of what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called O.P.C.W.’s “unbiased and professional” work. “No amount of disinformation from Assad’s enablers in Russia and Iran can hide the fact that the Assad regime is responsible for numerous chemical weapons attacks ” Mr. Pompeo said in a statement. The attacks in Ltamenah received little attention at the time because they did not kill anyone  but they came just days before a Syrian government chemical attack on another town nearby  Khan Sheikhoun  killed more than 80 people on April 4  2017. President Trump responded to that attack by ordering the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at military sites in Syria to punish Mr. al-Assad for using chemical weapons. The White House later declassified a report that accused Syria of not only carrying out the attack  but also working with the Russian government on a disinformation campaign to deflect blame. After the deadliest chemical attack in Syria’s war  on an area near Damascus known as Ghouta in August 2013  Russia facilitated an international agreement for Syria to give up its chemical weapons stockpiles and dismantle its capabilities. While members of the Obama administration lauded the agreement for getting rid of Syria’s chemical weapons peacefully  reports of chemical attacks by Mr. al-Assad’s forces continued to surface. The three chemical attacks attributed to the Syrian government in Wednesday’s report came after Syria was supposed to have relinquished all of its chemical weapons. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

08/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/europe/poland-judges-eu-court.html, world europe, E.U. Court Rules Poland Must Suspend Disciplinary Panel for Judges, It was another setback for the governing party’s bid to control the courts  which European officials called a grave threat to Poland’s democracy., Supported by It was another setback for the governing party’s bid to control the courts  which European officials called a grave threat to Poland’s democracy. By Joanna Berendt WARSAW — The European Union’s highest court introduced measures on Wednesday to halt Poland’s widely criticized disciplinary regime for judges  the latest blow in a yearslong battle with the country’s governing Law and Justice party over what critics denounce as attempts to erode the independence of the judiciary. In a temporary move that analysts said was highly likely to become permanent in the future  the Court of Justice of the European Union ordered the suspension of a new disciplinary chamber of the Polish Supreme Court  which has a politically selected membership and extraordinary powers to prosecute judges who oppose the government. “Judging from the past rulings of the European tribunal  we can expect that today’s decision is a preview of a future conviction for the illegal persecution of the Polish judges by the government ” said Judge Krystian Markiewicz  president of Iustitia  the biggest association of judges in Poland. “This decision is just about the disciplinary measures  but it’s clear that the court questions the state of the rule of law in Poland in general.” Still  Poland’s officials responded with contempt  suggesting they might not follow the court’s order. A deputy justice minister  Sebastian Kaleta  said in a statement posted on Twitter that the European court had “no power to evaluate or suspend constitutional organs of any member states.” “Today’s ruling is an act of usurpation violating Poland’s sovereignty ” he said. The court can  however  impose substantial daily fines if Poland fails to comply with the order within a month. Despite earlier adverse rulings in the European court and threats of sanctions from European lawmakers and officials  the populist governing party has continued efforts to put its mark on most of the key institutions of Poland’s judiciary in the past four years. Officials have described the changes as designed to purge corruption and vestiges of communism. The European court’s decision was in line with recommendations issued by the European Commission  the European Union’s executive arm  in January. A further sign of trouble came in February  when a German regional court in the city of Karlsruhe declined to extradite a Polish citizen under the European Arrest Warrant procedure  saying it could not be confident that he would be guaranteed a fair trial in Poland — a remarkable rebuke from the judiciary of one E.U. member country to another. Experts say that if Poland does not change course  this verdict will mark the beginning of Warsaw’s exclusion from the European legal community. “This had been long expected  and now an avalanche is coming ” said Artur Nowak-Far  professor of European law at Warsaw School of Economics. “Soon the courts in other member states will be questioning Poland’s compromised judiciary  referencing the German example. Poland’s rulings will also no longer be trusted in the European Union  and that means serious trouble for Warsaw as well as international business that has any ties to Poland.” More international institutions have expressed concerns over the legal standoff in Poland. The Council of Europe added Poland this year to its monitoring procedure on the rule of law  making it the only E.U. member country on a list including the likes of Turkey and Russia. “The European Union is first and foremost a community of law  and Poland is violating that community ” Professor Nowak-Far said. “This is already the fifth or sixth case relating to the state of the rule of law in Poland before the European court. And we can expect at least one more in the near future regarding Poland’s new disciplinary measures.” The new disciplinary system  which critics call the “muzzle act” or “gag law ” includes provisions that aim to prevent judges from questioning the independence of peers picked by bodies controlled by the governing party. It also seeks to punish those who publicly criticize the government’s judicial overhaul and forces judges to report their membership in any associations. As the measures began in February  several Polish justices quit their posts  saying that they could no longer in clear conscience fulfill their obligations. Judge Stanislaw Zablocki  who had been sitting on the Supreme Court panel since 1991 and served as the head of the Criminal Chamber  retired a day before the law came into effect. “A lawyer cannot break the rules and cannot set an example of breaking those rules  especially at a time when so much depends on how thoroughly young justices  young lawyers abide by the rules ” he said in a long statement posted on Facebook. “I will not contribute to proceedings that are founded on this law that  in my opinion  violates Poland’s Constitution and the values considered to be the foundation of European law.” All across Poland  judges protested the new law on what they called “Black Friday for European Judiciary.” Judges from a regional court in the northern city of Gdynia posed for photographs with their mouths covered with duct tape. Judges in other cities were photographed holding muzzles and banners saying “We will not be intimidated” and “The Disciplinary Chamber is not a court and its decisions are not rulings.” Following those events  Iustitia released an alarming report about the reprisals dozens of Polish judges have faced in the last two years as a result of criticism of the government. Those reprisals include disciplinary proceedings  state-led campaigns of intimidation  pay cuts and  most recently  criminal charges. Judge Igor Tuleya  a vocal critic of the judicial overhaul  faces up to three years in prison if the new disciplinary board waives his immunity. He has been charged with undermining a trial by allowing reporters at a closed hearing in 2017. But Judge Tuleya said in an interview that he had no doubts that the charges have more to do with the ruling he issued in that case  which was “very much not to the ruling party’s liking.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/world/08poland-courts1/merlin_166843323_35047b93-d1b3-40ff-87c4-de31362e9196-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By John Eligon  Audra D. S. Burch  Dionne Searcey and Richard A. Oppel Jr. The coronavirus is infecting and killing black people in the United States at disproportionately high rates  according to data released by several states and big cities  highlighting what public health researchers say are entrenched inequalities in resources  health and access to care. The statistics are preliminary and much remains unknown because most cities and states are not reporting race as they provide numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities. Initial indications from a number of places  though  are alarming enough that policymakers say they must act immediately to stem potential devastation in black communities. The worrying trend is playing out across the country  among people born in different decades and working far different jobs. There is Donnie Hoover  a judge from Charlotte  N.C.  who could not shake a dry cough that arrived in March. On the South Side of Chicago  LaShawn Levi  a medical assistant who rides the bus to work each day  turned to tea and cough syrup — “everything your grandma taught you” — to treat a headache and a cough. And in Detroit  Glenn Tolbert  a union leader for city bus drivers  was coughing so much that he got tested. “This is a call-to-action moment for all of us ” said Lori Lightfoot  the mayor of Chicago  who announced statistics of the outbreak in her city this week. African-Americans account for more than half of those who have tested positive and 72 percent of virus-related fatalities in Chicago  even though they make up a little less than a third of the population. “Those numbers take your breath away  they really do ” said Ms. Lightfoot  who is the city’s first black woman elected as mayor. She added in an interview that the statistics were “among the most shocking things I think I’ve seen as mayor.” In Illinois  43 percent of people who have died from the disease and 28 percent of those who have tested positive are African-Americans  a group that makes up just 15 percent of the state’s population. African-Americans  who account for a third of positive tests in Michigan  represent 40 percent of deaths in that state even though they make up 14 percent of the population. In Louisiana  about 70 percent of the people who have died are black  though only a third of that state’s population is. North Carolina and South Carolina also have reported a ratio of black residents to white residents who have tested positive for the virus that well exceeds the general population ratio. Black people are overrepresented among those infected in the Las Vegas area and among people who have tested positive for the virus in Connecticut. In Minnesota  black people have been infected with the coronavirus at rates roughly proportionate to their percentage of the state’s population. On Tuesday  President Trump acknowledged the growing signs of disparity  and said that federal authorities were working to provide statistics over the next two or three days that might help examine the issue. “Why is it that the African-American community is so much  numerous times more than everybody else?” he said at a daily briefing on the coronavirus. For many public health experts  the reasons behind the disparities are not difficult to explain  the result of longstanding structural inequalities. At a time when the authorities have advocated staying home as the best way to avoid the virus  black Americans disproportionately belong to part of the work force that does not have the luxury of working from home  experts said. That places them at high risk for contracting the highly infectious disease in transit or at work. Ms. Levi  the medical assistant from Chicago who fell ill  thinks that her daily bus ride to work could have been the source of her exposure. Or  she said  she could have picked it up in the hospital where she works  at the grocery store  or from food served to her. “I’m just not sure ” said Ms. Levi  45  who has asthma and high blood pressure. Longstanding inequalities also make African-Americans less likely to be insured  and more likely to have existing health conditions and face racial bias that prevents them from getting proper treatment. Initial indications are that doctors are less likely to refer African-Americans for testing when they visit a clinic with symptoms of Covid-19  the disease caused by the virus. Since the disease can progress quickly  researchers say  a disparity in testing can lead to considerably worse outcomes. A lack of early communication about the threat of Covid-19 and confusing messages that followed left an information vacuum in some black communities that allowed false rumors to fester that black people were immune to the disease. Some places ended up behind in taking measures to slow the spread. Sharrelle Barber  an assistant research professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University  said the effects of government redlining policies that began in the 1930s linger. Many black residents live in segregated neighborhoods that lack job opportunities  stable housing  grocery stores with healthy food and more. High levels of segregation in large urban counties lower the life expectancies of African-American residents but have little effect on the life expectancies of white residents  according to an analysis of the County Health Rankings by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Before the pandemic hit  officials had calculated that white Chicagoans had an average life expectancy of 8.8 years longer than black residents. “These communities  structurally  they’re breeding grounds for the transmission of the disease ” Dr. Barber said. “It’s not biological. It’s really these existing structural inequalities that are going to shape the racial inequalities in this pandemic.” Work kept Mr. Tolbert  54  who drove a Detroit bus for 24 years before becoming president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 26  from staying home as the virus spread. All through March  Mr. Tolbert said  he proceeded with his responsibilities of checking on the well-being of drivers at the bus depot and on passengers along city routes. On April 2  Mr. Tolbert was coughing so much during a meeting with Mike Duggan  the mayor of Detroit  that Mr. Duggan suggested he get tested. He was one of the first people in the city to take a rapid test and got his results back in 15 minutes. “I was social distancing — at least I thought I was ” Mr. Tolbert said. “I don’t know where it happened.” The death toll has been particularly devastating among African-Americans. “What’s really important is who is succumbing to the infection ” said Dr. Phillip D. Levy  the associate chairman for research in the department of emergency medicine at Wayne State University. “That gives you an idea of the severity of the illness and the impact on the community.” One factor that might make the coronavirus more devastating for African-Americans is that they experience high levels of stress-mediated wear and tear known as “weathering ” said Arline Geronimus  a professor of public health at the University of Michigan who studies the concept. Stresses like exposure to toxins  lack of sleep and racial discrimination  Dr. Geronimus said  can cause a kind of accelerated aging. The coronavirus is most lethal in people over 65. Watching news reports of coronavirus racial disparities this week  Dr. Geronimus said she had found herself shouting at her television. “They’re saying  ‘We don’t know why ’” Dr. Geronimus said  “and I’m standing there saying  ‘It’s weathering!’” Medical experts  community activists and policymakers are pushing for greater transparency on racial data. Officials who are reporting racial data are doing so only for cases in which the patient’s race is known. For a large percentage of total cases in some places — sometimes more than 40 percent — no racial information is available. And officials in many states  including those hit hard by the pandemic — California  New Jersey  New York and Washington State — have not provided statewide information about the race of patients. That has raised anger in some corners. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have demanded that the Trump administration collect race and ethnicity data on coronavirus testing and treatment. And Jumaane D. Williams  the public advocate for New York City  sent a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio calling for the release of a breakdown of cases by race. In Mecklenburg County  N.C.  where black residents are overrepresented in the number of positive tests  George Dunlap  the chairman of the county commission  said he was skeptical of the data. He said he believed that African-Americans in that county  which includes Charlotte  were overrepresented because the group was being tested at a higher rate  according to information he said he received from county health officials. But North Carolina’s top health official said the disparities aligned with historical trends. “This current crisis lays out what we have known for a long time  which is that your ZIP code is often a determinant of your health outcome ” said Dr. Mandy Cohen  secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Judge Hoover  the Mecklenburg County Superior Court judge who has tested positive for the virus  is 70. His wife  Josephine  has also tested positive. He was receiving chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and she has diabetes  underlying medical issues that put them at higher risk of severe illness. While Judge Hoover recuperated in their condominium in downtown Charlotte  Ms. Hoover  a retired math teacher  was hospitalized for two weeks. Even now  they are staying at least six feet apart in their home. “I am assuming that I picked it up in the courthouse and gave it to her ” he said. “We were so scared. And we are still scared because we do not know for sure if we are out of the woods.” Amy Harmon  Mitch Smith and Matt Furber contributed reporting.

More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/us/07virus-race2-copy2/07virus-race2-copy2-articleLarge-v5.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Even so  the state’s and city’s own initial efforts failed to keep pace with the outbreak  The Times found. Credit...Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times Supported by By J. David Goodman A 39-year-old woman took Flight 701 from Doha  Qatar  to John F. Kennedy International Airport in late February  the final leg of her trip home to New York City from Iran. A week later  on March 1  she tested positive for the coronavirus  the first confirmed case in New York City of an outbreak that had already devastated China and parts of Europe. The next day  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  appearing with Mayor Bill de Blasio at a news conference  promised that health investigators would track down every person on the woman’s flight. But no one did. A day later  a lawyer from New Rochelle  a New York City suburb  tested positive for the virus — an alarming sign because he had not traveled to any affected country  suggesting community spread was already taking place. Although city investigators had traced the lawyer’s whereabouts and connections to the most crowded corridors of Manhattan  the state’s efforts focused on the suburb  not the city  and Mr. de Blasio urged the public not to worry. “We’ll tell you the second we think you should change your behavior ” the mayor said on March 5. For many days after the first positive test  as the coronavirus silently spread throughout the New York region  Mr. Cuomo  Mr. de Blasio and their top aides projected an unswerving confidence that the outbreak would be readily contained. There would be cases  they repeatedly said  but New York’s hospitals were some of the best in the world. Plans were in place. Responses had been rehearsed during “tabletop” exercises. After all  the city had been here before — Ebola  Zika  the H1N1 virus  even Sept. 11. “Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers — I speak for the mayor also on this one — we think we have the best health care system on the planet right here in New York ” Mr. Cuomo said on March 2. “So  when you’re saying  what happened in other countries versus what happened here  we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries.” But now  New York City and the surrounding suburbs have become the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States  with far more cases than many countries have. More than 138 000 people in the state have tested positive for the virus  with nearly all of them in the city and nearby suburbs. On Tuesday  Mr. Cuomo announced that 731 more people had died of the virus  the state’s highest one-day total yet. The overall death toll in New York is 5 489 people. Epidemiologists have pointed to New York City’s density and its role as an international hub of commerce and tourism to explain why the coronavirus has spread so rapidly. And it seems highly unlikely that any response by the state or city could have fully stopped the pandemic. From the earliest days of the crisis  state and city officials were also hampered by a chaotic and often dysfunctional federal response  including significant problems with the expansion of coronavirus testing  which made it far harder to gauge the scope of the outbreak. Normally  New York would get help from Washington in such a time  as it did after Sept. 11. But President Trump in February and early March minimized the coronavirus threat  clashing with his own medical experts and failing to marshal the might of the federal government soon after cases emerged in the United States. As a result  state and city officials often had to make decisions early on without full assistance from the federal government. Even so  the initial efforts by New York officials to stem the outbreak were hampered by their own confused guidance  unheeded warnings  delayed decisions and political infighting  The New York Times found. “Flu was coming down  and then you saw this new ominous spike. And it was Covid. And it was spreading widely in New York City before anyone knew it ” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden  the former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the city’s Health Department. “You have to move really fast. Hours and days. Not weeks. Once it gets a head of steam  there is no way to stop it.” Dr. Frieden said that if the state and city had adopted widespread social-distancing measures a week or two earlier  including closing schools  stores and restaurants  then the estimated death toll from the outbreak might have been reduced by 50 to 80 percent. But New York mandated those measures after localities in states including California and Washington had done so. San Francisco  for example  ordered schools closed on March 12 when that city had 18 confirmed cases; Ohio also ordered its schools closed on the same day  with five confirmed cases. Mr. de Blasio ordered schools in New York to close three days later when the city had 329 cases. Then seven Bay Area counties imposed stay-at-home rules on March 17. Two days later  the entire state of California ordered the same. New York State’s stay-at-home order came on the 20th  and went into effect on March 22. “New York City as a whole was late in social measures ” said Isaac B. Weisfuse  a former New York City deputy health commissioner. “Any after-action review of the pandemic in New York City will focus on that issue. It has become the major issue in the transmission of the virus.” Interviews with more than 60 people on the front-lines of the unfolding crisis — city and state officials  hospital executives  health care workers  union leaders and emergency medical workers — revealed how the virus overwhelmed the city’s longstanding preparations  leaving officials to improvise. Many spoke on the record; others spoke anonymously to describe private meetings and conversations without fear of losing their jobs. “Everything was slow ” said Councilman Stephen T. Levin  a Brooklyn Democrat who had called for City Hall to take swifter action as the outbreak spread. “You have to adapt really quickly  and nothing we were doing was adapting quickly.” Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have focused intensely in recent days on vastly expanding the ability of the health care system to treat coronavirus patients as the outbreak nears its peak. The state and city have set up new hospital wards  scoured the world for ventilators and protective gear and aggressively recruited doctors and nurses around the country. Mr. Cuomo has been praised for his informative daily news conferences  where he not only focuses on the facts of the pandemic but also seeks to rally the public’s support for efforts to curb the spread. Mr. de Blasio has also made outreach a priority. Still  Mr. Cuomo has at times acknowledged the difficulties in fighting the outbreak. “I am tired of being behind this virus ” he said on March 31. “We’ve been playing catch-up. You don’t win playing catch-up.” The governor’s aides said he was referring to the country as a whole  not New York. The governor and the mayor emphasized that they had no misgivings about their initial handling of their response. They said that their efforts spurred the Trump administration to act more decisively to curb the outbreak. New York was the first state to obtain federal approval for its own coronavirus testing. “Every action I took was criticized at the time as premature ” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. “The facts have proven my decisions correct.” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement  “We’re dealing with a virus that’s only months old and science that changes by the day ” adding that “hindsight is a luxury none of us have in the heat of battle.” From the start  Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo projected as much concern about panic as they did about the virus. “We can really keep this thing contained ” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference about virus preparations in late February. That tone continued even after the first positive case was announced on March 1. “Everybody is doing exactly what we need to do ” said Mr. Cuomo  seated with Mr. de Blasio  at a news conference on March 2. “We have been ahead of this from Day 1.” Hospitals also expressed confidence in their plans for responding to a pandemic  with the Healthcare Association of New York State declaring on March 2 that its members were “prepared for an influx of patients caused by Covid-19.” But few  if any  appeared to have made significant efforts before the virus hit to greatly increase supplies of ventilators or protective gear  looking instead to draw on emergency government stockpiles. Officials seemed to speak and act based on the assumption that the virus had not arrived in the state until that first case — the woman traveling from Iran. State and local officials now acknowledge that the virus was almost certainly in New York much earlier. Infectious disease specialists had known for weeks before any positive test had occurred that many of the early cases would be missed because of significant flaws in federal testing. Bruce Farber  the chief of infectious diseases for two hospitals within Northwell Health  the largest hospital system in New York  said that by late January  it was apparent that cases would soon begin appearing in the United States. He said he and his colleagues realized  as they reviewed the strictly limited federal testing criteria during a Feb. 7 meeting  that many infected people would not be identified. Only those with a fever severe enough to require hospitalization and who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days could get tested  Dr. Farber told them  reading from the C.D.C. guidelines. “It was that moment that I think everybody in the room realized  we’re dead ” Dr. Farber said. For both city and state  the initial plan was to trace  isolate and contain each case. Mr. Cuomo promised that they would go further than necessary to find every connection to the woman who arrived from Iran. “Out of an abundance of caution we will be contacting the people who were on the flight with her from Iran to New York ” he said. But no one ever did that work. Local officials could only request an investigation from the C.D.C.  and the agency did not perform one because they believed at the time she had not been contagious during the flight  officials said. Neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mr. de Blasio publicly mentioned finding the plane passengers again. That’s because new cases in the area kept emerging: the lawyer in New Rochelle who worked in Manhattan but had no connection to the first case and had not traveled to countries affected by the virus. Then two more people in New York City tested positive  also unconnected to the affected countries and  more ominously  to each other. New York City  at the start of the outbreak  relied on 50 disease detectives to trace the rapidly rising cases of unconnected infected people  city officials said. By comparison  in Wuhan  China  where the pandemic began  more than 9 000 such workers were deployed. New York City added to its original 50 only after the outbreak began to accelerate. Because of the limits on testing  said the mayor’s press secretary  Freddi Goldstein  “all the detectives in the world would have been useless.” By March 5  Mr. de Blasio seemed to acknowledge the virus had spread beyond control. “You have to assume it could be anywhere in the city ” he said. Still  not wanting to cause undue alarm  he told New Yorkers to go on with their normal lives  which left many confused about the danger they faced. The city’s health commissioner  Dr. Oxiris Barbot  had sought to reassure commuters  in early February  that “this is not something that you’re going to contract in the subway or on the bus.” The mayor reiterated the point several times in early March. But there seemed to be little basis for that confidence. The C.D.C. in early February said it was “unclear” if the virus could be transferred on surfaces and  by March  said that it might “be possible” for someone to get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. The virus mainly spreads between people in close contact  the agency has said  such as occurs on a crowded subway. State and city officials blamed the confusing messages on shifting guidance from the federal government. But by the second week in March  as the virus continued to spread widely  Mr. de Blasio also clashed over messaging with his own Health Department. The mayor wanted widespread testing  but senior Health Department officials believed it was a waste of limited resources. They urged instead a public awareness campaign to tell people with mild symptoms to stay home and not infect others  or themselves  by going to testing centers. City Hall blocked the department from releasing that message to the public  until the mayor eventually backed down in the third week in March. New York City’s system for detecting infectious diseases was flashing danger. While only about 100 cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed in the whole state  the city’s surveillance system was  by the end of the first week in March  signaling a spike in influenza-like illnesses at emergency rooms. A few days later  the number of police officers calling out sick jumped noticeably  as did calls to 911 for fever and cough. The governor and the mayor began taking limited steps to restrict people’s activities  but even those were met with resistance. Locals complained when the governor ordered a porous “containment area” for New Rochelle  where a cluster had emerged. It meant closing schools and gathering places in a one-mile radius of a synagogue at the center of the outbreak  while allowing movement in and out. Each day brought some new action. The governor declared a state of emergency  worked to expand testing capacity and  later  secured the construction of field hospitals. The mayor and the governor encouraged work-from-home. They restricted large gatherings to 500 people  and reduced by half the occupancy for restaurants and bars. Broadway closed. So did most other big entertainment venues. Still some people flouted the rules  continuing to gather in public. But the biggest and most prolonged battle centered on closing the city’s school system  with its 1.1 million students. Doing so would amount to a virtual shutdown of the city. The mayor and his aides worried about the effect on the poorest and most vulnerable New Yorkers. For Mr. de Blasio  whose progressive political identity has been defined by his attention to the city’s have-nots  the crisis presented a stark and unwelcome choice to harm some New Yorkers in order to save others. “If you suddenly in one day close down the schools  how do you make sure that you are providing for these kids and their parents?” said Emma Wolfe  a top aide to Mr. de Blasio. “We’re not in the suburbs. We can’t tell people to stay at home and play around in your yard.” Behind the scenes  top health officials were growing increasingly alarmed. Demetre Daskalakis  the city’s head of disease control  threatened to quit if the schools were not closed  a city official said. City Hall said no such threat reached the mayor’s attention. And Dr. Barbot — who at the start of the outbreak had insisted that “New Yorkers remain at low risk” — gave a far scarier assessment to a closed-door meeting of business executives in City Hall on March 12: Up to 70 percent of city residents could become infected. The time for containment was over  she added. Mr. de Blasio  seated beside her at the meeting  stared daggers as she spoke. “Why don’t you shut down restaurants now?” a chief executive who attended the meeting recalled someone asking the mayor. “I’m really concerned about restaurateurs; I’m really concerned about jobs ” the mayor responded  the executive recalled. Mr. de Blasio had urged New Yorkers to start social distancing and work from home where possible. The following weekend  even though Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo had ordered occupancy limits for restaurants and bars  much of the city’s nightlife appeared to continue apace. State and city officials believed they were doing everything possible to confront the outbreak  moving from big decision to big decision so quickly that each day  they said  felt like a year. They blamed the spread in New York on the federal government  which they say dragged its feet on testing. For weeks  Mr. Trump brushed aside concerns that the outbreak would damage the country. “We have it totally under control ” Mr. Trump said in late January. A month later  he advised Americans to “view this the same as the flu.” But local officials did have control over closing schools and businesses. While they waited on making a decision  other major cities were moving toward shutdowns. In California  Los Angeles followed San Francisco’s lead and ordered its schools closed on March 13  after 40 cases of the virus had been confirmed. On that same day  there were nearly four times as many confirmed cases in New York  but City Hall did not yet support closing schools. And even as aides to the mayor and governor  both Democrats  worked closely together on the response  old rivalries crept in. Though the two leaders put up a unified front at the outset of the outbreak  it was clear by the middle of March that a high-stakes version of their longstanding political battles was playing out. The March 2 news conference has been their only appearance together. First  Mr. Cuomo sought to force the mayor’s hand on the schools  state officials said. In a series of calls during the second weekend in March  the governor worked with the Greater New York Hospital Association  a powerful hospital lobby  to address the question of child care for health care workers in the event that schools closed. That had been a sticking point for those workers’ union  1199 SEIU  which has deep ties to City Hall. The hospital association volunteered to raise funds. The union  which had questioned the need to close schools on that Friday  was by Sunday calling for closure. That Sunday morning  March 15  Health Department officials gave Mr. de Blasio some chilling forecasts of the number of possible dead if more restrictions were not imposed. Closing schools was necessary  and most businesses too. By then  the city had a plan to create centers for the children of health care workers  as well as emergency medical workers. Finally  Mr. de Blasio was persuaded. As the city prepared an announcement to close the schools  Mr. Cuomo announced the shutdown during a television appearance. Mr. de Blasio made it official that evening  and then announced restaurants and bars would be closed for everything but takeout and delivery. After the decision on schools  the mayor became more assertive in suggesting major changes in daily life. New Yorkers would probably soon have to be kept at home for all but the most necessary needs  he said on March 17 — a “shelter-in-place” order similar to what had already been implemented in the Bay Area of California. This time  Mr. Cuomo was the one who resisted. He favored a more gradual shutdown. “I’m as afraid of the fear and the panic as I am of the virus  and I think that the fear is more contagious than the virus right now ” the governor said when asked two days later about the mayor’s comments. He chastised the mayor for a poor communication strategy. But then California moved first: Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide order for residents to stay at home. The state had 675 confirmed cases of the virus. That same day  March 19  New York had more than 4 152. That night  roughly 20 prominent New York leaders — including local members of Congress  two borough presidents  City Council members and civic and religious figures — joined a conference call convened by the state attorney general  Letitia James. “I was growing very frustrated over the schism between the mayor and the governor ” said one person on the call  who captured the sentiment. After the call  a participant conveyed those feelings to the governor’s office. Melissa DeRosa  the governor’s top aide  said Mr. Cuomo decided on his plan to “pause” New York during an afternoon meeting with his health commissioner  before the call or Mr. Newsom’s order. The governor had been reviewing disturbing projections about the spread of the virus since 4:30 a.m.  she said. “OK  let’s shut it down ” she recalled the governor saying. He announced it the next day. By that point  March 20  the state had more than 7 000 confirmed cases. Leaders of the New York Police Department now start each day with a review of how many of its 36 000 uniformed officers are sick. By early April  it was around 19 percent. “It’s been a struggle ” said the police commissioner  Dermot F. Shea. Only the fact of a shutdown city has helped. No parades or protests. No calls to schools. Fewer calls for police in general. The calls to 911  instead  are mostly for ambulances. First it was 5 000 a day. Then 6 000. A record almost daily. That New York City  mammoth and interconnected  would be hit hard by the pandemic may have been inevitable. But Washington  and then New York  had options. The state’s leaders had power over key decisions. Their aides argue they moved as fast as possible given the flawed information they had from the federal government and in the midst of a fast-moving crisis on a scale none had seen before. “This is an enemy that we have underestimated from Day 1 ” Mr. Cuomo said on Monday. “And we have paid the price dearly.” Jesse Drucker  Luis Ferré Sadurní  Joseph Goldstein  Jeffery C.

If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/nyregion/00nyvirus-ticktock1/00nyvirus-ticktock1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/nyregion/author-j-david-goodman/author-j-david-goodman-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/nyregion/00nyvirus-ticktock11/merlin_169898430_0bd836f4-2adb-4cde-bb17-6493371aab4a-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Raymond Zhong and Vivian Wang China on Wednesday ended its lockdown of Wuhan  the city where the coronavirus first emerged and a potent symbol in a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people  shaken the global economy and thrown daily life into upheaval across the planet. But the city that has reopened after more than 10 weeks is a profoundly damaged one  a place whose recovery will be watched worldwide for lessons on how populations move past pain and calamity of such staggering magnitude. In Wuhan  sickness and death have touched hundreds of thousands of lives  imprinting them with trauma that could linger for decades. Businesses  even those that have reopened  face a wrenching road ahead  with sluggishness likely to persist. Neighborhood authorities continue to regulate people’s comings and goings  with no return to normalcy in sight. The Chinese authorities sealed off Wuhan  an industrial hub of 11 million people  in late January  in a frantic attempt to limit the outbreak’s spread. At the time  many outsiders saw it as an extreme step  one that could be tried only in an authoritarian system like China’s. But as the epidemic has worsened  governments around the world have enacted a variety of stringent restrictions on their citizens’ movements. Some 1.4 million infections and 80 000 deaths have been reported worldwide — figures that are rising fast  and that officials say vastly understate the true extent of the pandemic. The contagion has slowed in hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain  but it continues to spread quickly elsewhere around the globe  including in the United States  which is approaching 400 000 known infections. News reports are filled with scenes of overflowing hospitals in New York City  uncollected bodies on streets in Ecuador  updates on the condition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain  who is hospitalized in intensive care  and expert warnings that the epidemic could be exploding  undetected  in the poorest parts of the world. Most of Europe  India  much of the United States and many other places are under orders for businesses to close and most people to stay at home  abruptly crippling economies and throwing millions of people out of work. The full measure of the sacrifice that such policies entail — in jobs and income lost  in lives disrupted — might first be taken in Wuhan. Wednesday’s reopening came after only three new coronavirus cases were reported in the city in the previous three weeks  and a day after China reported no new deaths for the first time since January. Controls on outbound travel were officially lifted just after midnight in China. People can now leave after presenting to the authorities a government-sanctioned phone app that indicates — based on their home addresses  recent travels and medical histories — whether they are contagion risks. Footage from state-run news outlets early Wednesday showed a rush of cars traveling through toll stations on the outskirts of Wuhan immediately after the restrictions were lifted. China’s national rail operator estimated that more than 55 000 people would leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday  according to a state-run broadcaster. Within the city  however  tough rules on individuals and businesses are still in place to prevent the virus from regaining a foothold. Officials continue to urge everyone to stay at home as much as possible. Schools are still closed. Many people in Wuhan do not need to be told to keep isolating themselves  to say nothing about leaving the city. The experience of death and near-death has left psychic wounds. Of mainland China’s more than 80 000 reported cases of the virus  nearly two-thirds have been in Wuhan. “Wuhan people experienced it firsthand ” said Yan Hui  a Wuhan native and sales executive in her 50s who recovered from the coronavirus. “Their friends got sick. Their friends and friends’ relatives died. Right before their eyes  one by one  they left us.” “Their understanding of this disaster is deeper compared to people in other cities ” she said. Wuhan is already not the same metropolis where  not so long ago  the passage of time seemed to have ground to a halt. In recent days  more shops have reopened  often setting up street-front counters so that customers can buy vegetables  alcohol  cigarettes and other goods without entering. In parks along the Yangtze River  growing numbers of families have ventured out to take in the sunshine and fresh air. Older residents have started congregating again in small groups to chat or play rounds of Chinese chess. Children are a rarer sight  and always appear to be under the wary watch of parents. Public buses and the subway system have restarted  although they often seem to have few passengers. Mountains of cardboard boxes have sprouted up outside apartment complexes as online shopping picks up. According to JD.com  an e-retailer  delivery orders in Hubei Province  of which Wuhan is the capital  increased threefold in March compared with February. And more people are treating themselves  the company said: They have shifted from buying daily necessities and home fitness equipment to buying clothing  cosmetics and travel accessories. Companies in Wuhan have been cautiously calling their employees back to work  contributing to the revival of city life. Across Wuhan  nearly 94 percent of businesses — almost 11 000 of them in total — have resumed operations  said Hu Yabo  the city’s deputy mayor  at a recent news briefing. For major industrial enterprises  the rate exceeded 97 percent. For service companies  it was 93 percent. It is unclear how much business they are actually doing  however. At industrial companies in Wuhan  only 60 percent of employees are on the job  and electricity consumption is one-fifth less than what it was this time last year  said Dang Zhen  another city official  at the same briefing. Honda’s local venture is back to producing at full capacity  Mr. Hu said. Huawei  the Chinese tech giant  said on social media that employees at its Wuhan research center were eagerly returning to work “as a fresh wave of positivity pulsates around the building.” Yet gloom about the local economy remains widespread. Much of China’s factory sector is suffering as the pandemic dampens overseas demand for exports. As businesses pull back their spending on equipment and offices  the effects will ripple through the rest of the economy. During the whole of February  when the epidemic was at its peak in China  not a single residential real-estate deal was made in Wuhan  neither for new properties nor for ones already built  according to government statistics. Helen Ding  47  works at an architectural design company in the city. While her firm’s existing projects are mostly large enough that they cannot be easily canceled  her bosses are concerned about future business and future clients. “The whole world is in a bad state  and as far as the future goes  nobody has much confidence ” Ms. Ding said. For many small businesses  the loss of income could lead to further trouble. Short on cash  companies that have laid off workers may not be able to rehire them right away. Others worry about backed-up inventories of unsold goods  maintenance costs for equipment and customs disputes as the pandemic continues to snarl commerce around the world. This month  a large group of restaurateurs in Wuhan wrote a letter to the city government pleading for rent relief  subsidized loans and wage support. The epidemic  they said  had been a “total disaster” for the industry. At the height of the epidemic  Liu Dongzhou thought about giving up on his company  which makes fish balls  shredded chicken  and other frozen and processed foods. Now  he hopes to restart operations next week — but expects to lay off a fifth of his 80 employees. Mr. Liu  45  has heard much talk of government policies to help small enterprises. But he does not think any will be available to him in the short term. Even if the authorities are allowing people to leave Wuhan  Mr. Liu said his own neighborhood had recently tightened its restrictions on residents’ movements. Wednesday does not feel like much of a milestone. “To an ordinary person  if you lift or don’t lift the lockdown  there isn’t that big of a difference ” he said. Ms. Yan  the sales executive  works in Wuhan for a unit of General Electric. Her bosses are wary of bringing too many employees back to work  fearing contagion. “They’ll grit their teeth and carry on ” she said. “It’s such a big company  after all.” Gritting one’s teeth and carrying on has characterized much about life in Wuhan these past months. In February  Ms. Yan spent 15 days fighting the virus in Huoshenshan  one of the city’s newly built coronavirus hospitals. After the outbreak began  she stockpiled food in her apartment. When she got home from the hospital  all of it had gone bad. She remains on sick leave  helping with company business when she can  but mostly resting at home. She has not seen her parents in two months  even though they live in the apartment complex next to hers. An experience like that changes things  and for Ms. Yan it has reshuffled her priorities: Health and family first. Work  career  success — all of that second. She has long talked about adjusting her life in that way. “But I never actually did it.” The ordeal has also helped her see her home city in a new light. The grass looks greener  the trees more luxuriant. There even seem to be more little songbirds in the garden outside her apartment. “Before this epidemic  Wuhan was a city with a lot of vitality ” Ms. Yan said. “Beijing  Shanghai  Guangzhou and Shenzhen are already economically mature. But Wuhan has just gotten started.” Wang Yiwei and Coral Yang contributed research. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html, us politics, Voting in Wisconsin During a Pandemic: Lines  Masks and Plenty of Fear, Wisconsin’s primary showed an electoral system stretched to the breaking point by the coronavirus crisis  as people weighed the health risks against their desire to vote., Supported by Wisconsin’s primary showed an electoral system stretched to the breaking point by the coronavirus crisis  as people weighed the health risks against their desire to vote. By Astead W. Herndon and Alexander Burns MILWAUKEE — Even before voting began  there were lines outside polling locations that stretched for several blocks. Some poll workers wore hazmat suits. Nearly every voter wore a face mask  removing it only to make small talk that reflected a combination of determination and grim humor about the extraordinary experience of voting amid a deadly pandemic. For thousands of people across Wisconsin on Tuesday  fears of the coronavirus outbreak did not stop them from participating in the state’s elections  where critical races such as the Democratic presidential primary and a key state Supreme Court seat were being decided. “It feels bad to have to choose between your personal safety and your right to vote ” said Dan Bullock  40  as he waited to vote at Washington High School on Milwaukee’s North Side. “But you have to be heard.” Many others across the state  however  appeared inclined to stay home as the fear of contracting the disease outweighed their desire to participate in the most fundamental ritual of democracy. Late Monday  Republicans in the state legislature had gone to court to block the Democratic governor’s order to postpone the primary. “No one should have to choose between risking their health and possibly dying and going to vote ” said Marcelia Nicholson  31  a county supervisor for Milwaukee. She said she was unsure she could vote safely after having been exposed to the coronavirus herself. In Milwaukee — where the number of polling stations was reduced from 180 to only five — voters tried to exercise proper social distancing as they waited  in some cases  for more than two hours. But in other areas of the state  including Madison  suburbs like Brookfield  and more rural areas like Beloit  the voting process was altered but not totally disrupted  with options that included curbside ballot access and poll locations that were more fully staffed. Milwaukee has the biggest minority population in the state  which means that geographic and partisan differences in access to voting often overlap with racial ones. The scenes that unfolded in Wisconsin showed an electoral system stretched to the breaking point by the same public health catastrophe that has killed thousands and brought the country’s economic and social patterns to a virtual standstill in recent weeks. And in Wisconsin  the political institutions proved overmatched  with a Republican legislature and a conservative state and federal judiciary resisting efforts to reschedule the election or revise the procedures for voting. The result was a dangerous spectacle that forced voters to choose between participating in an important election and protecting their health. While election administrators said they were trying in myriad ways to make the voting process safer  the long lines  last-minute judicial rulings and backlogged absentee ballot requests added up to something resembling system failure. Ellie Bradish  for instance  said she was forced to vote in person in Milwaukee after attempts at early voting and absentee voting failed. “My friend and colleagues at work were worried about me coming out ” Ms. Bradish  40  said. “But I was worried that if I didn’t come  my vote would be thrown out.” transcript “I cannot in good conscience allow any types of gathering that would further the spread of this disease and to put more lives at risk. There is not a sufficiently safe way to administer in-person voting tomorrow.” “I am 65. I’m a Type 2 diabetic. I have had heart issues. I mean  those are the risk factors they say can make it more serious.” “I actually think that it’s suppressive and dangerously irresponsible that the Legislature hasn’t either delayed the election or made it all mail-in ballot. I had a moment where I just really was not sure that I could do this. I woke up crying.” “We have some best practices things set up in there with a Plexiglas shield between the voter and the poll workers. We’re going to have masks available  gloves available  hand sanitizer. But it’s still going to be something that is a risk.” “We normally use 13 different polling locations. We normally have 300 poll workers to staff those locations. As of 10 days ago  we were down to 40.” The array of procedural problems led some state party officials to predict that the results would be contested by whichever side loses. “People are going to be wondering about the authenticity of the vote no matter what because of the politicalization ” said Patty Schachtner  a Democratic state senator from St. Croix County  who made her own mask to wear during a six-hour stint as a poll worker. National voting rights experts said the turmoil and acrimony surrounding the election could be an unsettling example of what might happen across the country later this spring if states do not manage to implement new methods of voting during the coronavirus outbreak — or even in the November general election if the pandemic has not abated by then. In Wisconsin  Gov. Tony Evers and his fellow Democrats pushed for a range of changes to the primary process  including rescheduling the election and switching to mail-in voting. But Democrats faced a wall of resistance from Republicans who saw political advantage in leaving existing procedures intact. Almost forgotten amid a life-or-death debate about voting procedures was a Democratic presidential race that is still not formally finished: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders were both competing for delegates in Wisconsin  though neither man campaigned actively in the state. Mr. Biden  with a nearly insurmountable delegate lead overall  was expected to carry the primary  but in a strange byproduct of the tangled judicial rulings there would be no results released until next week. It was not only the Democratic presidential primary on the ballot on Tuesday in Wisconsin: there was intense competition over a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court  with one of the justices in the conservative majority battling for re-election. The winner will be in position to cast a deciding vote on a case before the court that seeks to purge more than 200 000 people from Wisconsin’s voter rolls. The panel has been a bulwark of Republican dominance in the state over the last decade  along with a G.O.P. majority in the State Legislature that has entrenched itself through aggressive gerrymandering. Like so much else in Wisconsin  the scene was markedly different outside the main urban areas. Republican county chairs boasted about their smooth process throughout the day  with short lines and ample room for a smattering of voters who often showed little signs of the current health crisis — no masks  no gloves. In Sheboygan County  about an hour north of Milwaukee up the Lake Michigan shore  Dennis Gasper  a Republican Party official  said he drove around local polling places and found no issues. “All the clerks have figured out how to deal with the coronavirus thing  so nobody should be having a problem voting ” Mr. Gasper said. Mr. Gasper chalked up complaints from Milwaukee and elsewhere to Democrats “making political points out of what would normally be a mundane election process.” But in Milwaukee  where there are more than 1 000 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 87 people have died of it  many voters cast their ballots wearing full protective gear  some overtaken with fear. Some Republican efforts to downplay the danger of the election ended up highlighting the medical risks involved. For instance  Robin Vos  the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly  posted on Facebook that he was volunteering as a poll worker  writing that “an impressive amount of planning and organization” went into securing the election. In photos  Mr. Vos looked ready to enter a contaminated zone: He was wearing a face mask  a plastic body covering and gloves. The partisan divide within Wisconsin over the safety and integrity of the election was mirrored on the national level  with the Democratic presidential candidates raising concerns about the safety of the vote and President Trump urging Republican voters to the polls as though little was out of the ordinary. On Twitter  Mr. Trump lauded the incumbent Wisconsin Supreme Court justice seeking re-election  Daniel Kelly  as a jurist who “loves your Military  Vets  Farmers.” And later in the day he weighed in on the vote by mail effort  saying without evidence  “The mail ballots are corrupt  in my opinion.’' “Mail ballots  they cheat ’’ the president said at his evening briefing on the virus. “Mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of cheaters. They go collect them. They are fraudulent in many cases.’’ Mr. Trump himself voted by mail in the 2018 midterms and in last month’s Florida primary. Mr. Sanders  who like Mr. Biden has held no campaign events in nearly a month because of the virus  took a far more somber approach  rebuking Wisconsin Republicans for risking “the health and safety of many thousands of Wisconsin voters” to force an election under conditions of extreme adversity. Mr. Biden  who last week said he would defer “to the scientists” and to state officials about in-person voting in Wisconsin  was more skeptical Tuesday night. “My gut is that we shouldn’t have had the election in the first place  the in-person election ’’ he said on CNN. “It should have been all-mail ballots in  it should have been moved in the way that five other states have done it.” It was not just Democratic candidates who called the election dangerous: As a series of court decisions were announced on Monday evening — every one of them a setback for Democrats — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other prominent party leaders accused the judiciary of siding with the Republican Party over the interests of voters. In perhaps the sternest comments of all  Ms. Pelosi rebuked the federal Supreme Court for rejecting an effort late Monday to extend absentee balloting in Wisconsin. The court  Ms. Pelosi said on television  was “undermining our democracy.” Despite the collective sense of civic duty on display in Wisconsin  many voters expressed dismay at the difficult circumstances. Kinnethia Tolson-Johnson arrived at her polling place in Milwaukee before it opened  hoping to avoid crowds and stay safe. But she had to wait outside for more than an hour while fellow voters organized themselves to keep proper distance. “It was discouraging ” Ms. Tolson-Johnson said. “And it was just hard to keep your energy.” Hannah Gleeson  a health care worker in Milwaukee who is 17 weeks pregnant  and who recently tested positive for coronavirus  said she was despondent about being unable to vote. “I’ve always said that every vote matters  every vote counts  and it’s your one chance to have your voice heard ” she said. “And it’s now something that I really feel has been taken away from me  and my husband as well.” Ms. Gleeson said she filed a request to vote by absentee ballot but never received one. “They’re delivering refrigerated trucks out to Milwaukee because they expect the death toll to be so high ” she said. “But they also expect us to go out and vote.” Representative Mark Pocan  a Democrat who represents Madison  said the electoral troubles that have been on display in the state the last few weeks should serve as a catalyst for national changes. “We should be the poster child for a national vote by mail program in November ” Mr. Pocan said. “We cannot risk having this confusion headed into the national election.” Astead W. Herndon reported from Milwaukee  and Alexander Burns from New York. Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from Washington  D.C.  and Nick Corasaniti from New York.

In removing him from that role  the president stripped him of his pandemic relief oversight duties as well., Supported by The official had been leading the office of the inspector general for the Pentagon. In removing him from that role  the president stripped him of his pandemic relief oversight duties as well. By Charlie Savage and Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Trump moved on Tuesday to oust the leader of a new watchdog panel charged with overseeing how his administration spends trillions of taxpayer dollars in coronavirus pandemic relief  the latest step in an abruptly unfolding White House power play against semi-independent inspectors general across the government. The official  Glenn A. Fine  has been the acting inspector general for the Defense Department since before Mr. Trump took office and was set to become the chairman of a new Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to police how the government carries out the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. But Mr. Trump replaced Mr. Fine in his Pentagon job  disqualifying him from serving on the new oversight panel. The move came at a time when the president has been reasserting authority over the executive branch and signaling impatience with independent voices within the government that he considers disloyal. In recent days  he fired an inspector general who reviewed the whistle-blower complaint that led to his impeachment  nominated a White House aide to another key inspector general post  declared that he would ignore certain oversight provisions in the new relief law and attacked another inspector general who criticized virus testing shortages. Mr. Trump even cheered the firing of the captain of an aircraft carrier for sending a letter to fellow Navy officers pleading for help for his virus-stricken crew  castigating the officer for airing unfavorable information. Only after a loud backlash over the firing and the acting Navy secretary’s speech calling the captain “stupid” did the president partly reverse himself and say he would look into it. The acting Navy secretary  who said he had ordered the firing because he assumed Mr. Trump might have done it himself otherwise  took the hint and resigned on Tuesday. The questions of accountability and loyalty within the government have been persistent themes in the past three years as Mr. Trump has repeatedly waged war with what he calls “the deep state.” He has rejected the conventional views that figures like the director of the F.B.I.  the attorney general  intelligence directors  uniformed military commanders  ethics officers and now inspectors general should have a degree of autonomy. At his daily coronavirus briefing  Mr. Trump offered no particular explanation for sidelining Mr. Fine but characterized it as part of a larger shuffle of inspectors general  some of them left over from past administrations  and cited unspecified “reports of bias.” Critics said on Tuesday that it sent a message to government watchdogs to tread softly. “I cannot see how any inspector general will feel in any way safe to do a good job ” said Danielle Brian  the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight  a nonprofit group. “They are all at the mercy at what the president feels.” But Mr. Trump’s allies said he felt burned by the investigations of his campaign and associates and therefore distrusts figures he perceives to be partisan foes within government  particularly former F.B.I. officials who obtained warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  or FISA  to investigate a campaign aide’s ties to Russia. “I’ve never heard the president express frustrations about independent oversight ” said Cliff Sims  a former White House aide. “But he doesn’t think he should be subjected to his political enemies in supposedly apolitical oversight roles. This has been deeply ingrained in his psyche since the moment he learned that FISA had been abused to spy on his campaign.” In removing Mr. Fine from his role overseeing pandemic spending  Mr. Trump targeted a former Justice Department inspector general who earned a reputation for aggressive independence in scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s use of surveillance and other law enforcement powers in the years after the Sept. 11  2001  attacks. Replacing Mr. Fine as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general will be Sean O’Donnell  who serves as the inspector general at the Environmental Protection Agency and will do double duty for the time being. A group of inspectors general led by Michael E. Horowitz  the Justice Department inspector general  will determine who will replace Mr. Fine as chairman of the new pandemic oversight committee. Created as part of the coronavirus relief bill  the committee consists of nine inspectors general from across the executive branch and will have an $80 million budget to hunt for waste  fraud  abuse and illegality in the disbursement of the $2.2 trillion approved by Congress to provide relief to Americans affected by the pandemic. In announcing Mr. Fine’s short-lived role last week  Mr. Horowitz had praised him as “uniquely qualified” to run oversight of “large organizations ” citing his 11 years as the top Justice Department watchdog and his four years serving as the top Pentagon one. “The inspector general community recognizes the need for transparency surrounding  and strong and effective independent oversight of  the federal government’s spending in response to this public health crisis ” Mr. Horowitz said at the time. Democrats immediately condemned Mr. Fine’s sudden ouster as “corrupt ” in the words of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the minority leader. “President Trump is abusing the coronavirus pandemic to eliminate honest and independent public servants because they are willing to speak truth to power and because he is so clearly afraid of strong oversight ” Mr. Schumer said. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney  Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee  called Mr. Trump’s actions “a direct insult to the American taxpayers — of all political stripes — who want to make sure that their tax dollars are not squandered on wasteful boondoggles  incompetence or political favors.” Still  it is not a given that Mr. O’Donnell will toe the line at the Pentagon. At the E.P.A.  he has issued reports that are critical of Mr. Trump’s appointed administrator  Andrew R. Wheeler  who has sought to limit Mr. O’Donnell’s authority and oversight. Only last week  after Mr. O’Donnell’s office released a report concluding that the E.P.A. failed to adequately warn communities living in proximity to certain carcinogenic chemicals of their health risks  Mr. Wheeler publicly rebuked the inspector general’s report for its “tone and substance” and demanded that he rescind it. Mr. O’Donnell refused. Privately  some people within the government’s inspector general community suggested that the appointment of Mr. O’Donnell to the Pentagon post would divert his oversight from the E.P.A.  which has continued to move forward with Mr. Trump’s agenda of reducing or eliminating public health and environmental regulations  even as the coronavirus rages. Before being appointed as the E.P.A. watchdog  Mr. O’Donnell clerked for two federal judges and worked since 2005 as a career lawyer at the Justice Department  most recently in the criminal division working on cases involving fraud  corruption and national security. At the Pentagon  Mr. O’Donnell will serve in an acting capacity pending Senate action on Jason Abend  a Customs and Border Protection official  who was nominated by Mr. Trump last week to take on the post permanently. Mr. Fine remains the No. 2 official at the Pentagon’s watchdog office. Late last month  several hours after Mr. Trump signed the $2 trillion coronavirus relief and stimulus bill with fanfare on television  he issued a signing statement challenging a key safeguard congressional Democrats insisted upon as a condition of approving $500 billion in corporate bailout funds: that a special inspector general be empowered to demand information about how the Treasury Department spends the money and who would be required to tell Congress if executive branch officials unreasonably balk. In his signing statement  Mr. Trump effectively declared that he could control what information goes to Congress about any disputes over access to information about how and why the money is spent. On Friday  he nominated Brian D. Miller  a White House aide  to serve as the special inspector general overseeing the corporate relief. Then late that night  Mr. Trump fired the inspector general for the intelligence community  Michael K. Atkinson  whose insistence on telling Congress about the whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine prompted impeachment proceedings last fall. At the same time  Mr. Trump also announced a slew of other inspector general nominees  including Mr. Abend as the new Defense Department inspector general  and three current and former Justice Department officials to be the new inspectors general at the C.I.A.  the Education Department and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Mr. Trump redoubled his attacks on the acting inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services  Christi A. Grimm  in a statement on Twitter on Tuesday  a day after she released a report about hospitals facing severe shortages in tests as they battle the pandemic. On Monday  Mr. Trump had suggested that Ms. Grimm’s report was politically biased against him. Ms. Grimm is a career official who began work at the inspector general office late in the Clinton administration and stayed there throughout the Bush and Obama administrations  taking over the role of acting inspector general in an interim capacity this year. Mr. Trump’s interest in inspectors general has grown more intense lately. Until his most recent nominations  he had failed to pick anyone for about one-third of the 37 inspector general positions that are presidentially appointed  according to the Project on Government Oversight. Those roles were temporarily assumed by other officials whose lack of job security and status typically makes them more cautious than a permanent appointee  government experts say.

Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/us/politics/07dc-ig/07dc-ig-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v2.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/australia/cardinal-george-pell-acquittal.html, world australia, Cardinal Pell’s Acquittal Was as Opaque as His Sexual Abuse Trial, Critics argue that Australia’s courts exhibited a penchant for secrecy and insular decision-making that resembled the Roman Catholic Church’s flawed response to sexual abuse within its ranks., Supported by news analysis Critics argue that Australia’s courts exhibited a penchant for secrecy and insular decision-making that resembled the Roman Catholic Church’s flawed response to sexual abuse within its ranks. By Damien Cave and Livia Albeck-Ripka SYDNEY  Australia — Cardinal George Pell walked out of prison on Tuesday after Australia’s highest court reversed his 2018 conviction for molesting two choirboys decades earlier — liberating the most senior Roman Catholic cleric to ever face trial over child sexual abuse. The world may never be able to assess whether the court’s reasoning was sound. The panel of seven judges ruled that the jury lacked sufficient doubt about the accusations against Cardinal Pell  the former archbishop of Melbourne and treasurer for the Vatican. Jurors  the court argued  ignored “compounding improbabilities” caused by conflicting accounts from the cardinal’s main accuser and other witnesses. But no one outside the court case can test that comparison. The central evidence — the testimony of the main accuser  on which the case “was wholly dependent ” the judges wrote — has never been released  not in video  audio nor even redacted transcripts. It is just one glaring example of the secrecy and lack of accountability that have shaped the Pell prosecution from the beginning. No criminal trial in Australia’s recent history has been as high-profile nor as hard to follow and scrutinize. The case has been a model of opaque operations  starting with judges who dismissed related allegations early on  followed by gag orders preventing media coverage and a refusal to release evidence — even when a jury verdict is dismissed as unreasonable. Legal experts said that the case made clear just how much power judges in Australia have to suppress public oversight and overrule jury verdicts  raising questions about whether the system adequately values citizen participation. At every stage  critics argue  Australia’s courts exhibited a penchant for secrecy and insular decision-making that resembled the Catholic Church’s flawed and damaging response to sexual abuse within its ranks. “It’s endemic to various areas in the landscape of Australian governance ” said Jason Bosland  a law professor at Melbourne University. “We have this approach of ‘Well  you just have to trust us.’ It’s a problem.” Australia’s legal system is built on British common law. There is no explicit protection in the constitution for free speech  although the High Court has said it implicitly does in some cases. And a verdict by a jury can be thrown out if an appeals court determines that its decision was unreasonable or could not be supported given the evidence. The success of such appeals is rare — but it worked for Cardinal Pell. If the decision came as a surprise  it’s largely because of how little the public could see along the way. From the very beginning of the case  Australia’s judges resisted legal principles that treat criminal trials as public events in order to ensure accountability for a justice system that promises an impartial rule of law. Early on  a sweeping suppression order restricted what journalists could publish  barring even the most basic details  such as the number of people involved in the original complaint. Strict rules that apply to all criminal cases  aiming to protect juries from information that might prejudice their decisions  also contributed to both a news and accountability blackout. The court prevented any mention of additional accusations lodged against Cardinal Pell and pressured news outlets to delete stories already published. “Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell ” a book by the journalist Louise Milligan  was pulled from bookstores to avoid risking a contempt of court charge. Journalists could not report on the case as it happened  meaning the original trial  which ended with a hung jury  largely disappeared. Even reporting about the suppression order  because it was a court document related to the proceedings  would have been considered breaking the law. Cardinal Pell was convicted in December 2018  but the verdict was not reported for two months. The court lifted its gag order only after a second trial involving additional accusations was dropped. “A problem in this case is that the public mostly couldn’t watch ” said Jeremy Gans  a professor at Melbourne Law School who closely followed the trial. “Most of us didn’t know any of the details  and none of us have seen the complainant’s testimony.” There was a reason for caution. Australia’s sexual abuse laws require that the identities of child victims be protected — in this case  the main accuser was 13 years old at the time of the alleged abuse in 1996. He came forward in 2015. But critics question whether the public’s right to know could have been preserved. “There should be some way of providing the public with access to the transcript in a way that doesn’t reveal the identity of the person so people can judge whether or not to agree ” Mr. Bosland said. “The only way the judicial branch of government is held accountable is through principle of open justice  and that requires that the public be given as much information as possible.” In its ruling on Tuesday  the High Court essentially decided the criminal case of one of the world’s most powerful religious figures based on how a jury had handled testimony that no one outside the proceedings has been able to assess. The judges’ order suggested that jurors put too much faith in the main accuser’s account without adequately considering the “unchallenged evidence” of additional witnesses. The prosecution  the order indicated  did not do enough to interrogate those who said the scene following a Sunday Mass 20 years earlier would have been too busy to allow for what was alleged — including the accusation that the cardinal forced his penis into the accuser’s mouth after catching the two choirboys drinking wine in the priests’ sacristy. But without the testimony of the accuser for comparison  it’s difficult to assess what led the jury to deliver a guilty verdict. Even some victims and their representatives said on Tuesday that they were beginning to question whether justice required completely obscuring the complainant’s testimony. Steven Spaner  Australia coordinator for the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests  said that as the trial went on  culminating in acquittal  “it started to look like this was not a fair deal  this was power  this was those who can influence using their influence.” Cardinal Pell’s prominence has always seemed to hover over the proceedings. Big George  as he was known in his hometown of Ballarat  Australia  carried a domineering mien and management style from his early days in the priesthood through his rapid rise up the ranks. He was often the public face of the Catholic Church’s response to the abuse scandal. As archbishop of Melbourne  he set up an alternative resolution process for abuse survivors that the Vatican admired  and that many Australians viewed with skepticism. It initially capped payments at 50 000 Australian dollars  or $31 000  with compensation conditioned on victims keeping their traumas confidential. Many saw him as a protector of finances first  and parishioners second. “There are a lot of people saying Pell was a scapegoat for the tragedy of this whole thing ” said Peter Wilkinson  a former Catholic priest and researcher in Melbourne. “That’s a reasonable argument. People were angry  extremely angry  and the allegations against George Pell gave then a human target for their anger.” A statement from the Vatican said Pope Francis “welcomes the High Court’s unanimous decision ” adding that he “has always expressed confidence in the Australian judicial authority.” He offered his morning Mass on Tuesday for those who suffer from unjust sentences. But for many of those who have been living with the legacy of abuse in the church  the High Court’s decision is a blow to their faith in a justice system they had just started to trust. Lisa Flynn  a lawyer representing the father of the deceased accuser in a civil claim  said that her client was struggling to understand how the criminal justice system had ultimately “failed both the choirboys” — the one who testified and a second who died before the trial. She said that the High Court’s decision revealed systemic issues in Australia’s capacity to deal with sexual violence and to trust the verdicts of its citizens. “The voice of the victims in this matter ” Ms. Flynn said  “haven’t really been heard.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/world/07oz-pell-1/merlin_137542122_b739ea81-e56f-47e4-9387-780c827e8cd8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-damien-cave/author-damien-cave-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-livia-albeck-ripka/author-livia-albeck-ripka-thumbLarge.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/canada/quebec-montreal-hip-hop-rapping-franglais.html, world canada, ‘What Rhymes With Purell?’ Franglais Rappers Push Language Boundaries in Quebec, Critics in Montreal say hip-hop artists mixing French and English are threatening the future of the French language in the majority Francophone province., Supported by Montreal dispatch Critics in Montreal say hip-hop artists mixing French and English are threatening the future of the French language in the majority Francophone province. By Dan Bilefsky MONTREAL — As pungent pot smoke filled the air in a bunkerlike  dimly lit basement recording studio in Montreal  the Quebec rapper Snail Kid pondered a question befitting these pandemic times: What word rhymes with Purell? Mulling how to fit the hand sanitizer into his latest rap lyric  he considered the English words “well ” “smell” and “toaster strudel” before toying with the French words “pluriel” and “ruelle.” Then  Snail Kid  30  a member of the popular Quebec hip-hop group Dead Obies began to rap: Le monde ici est cruel On n’est plus well (The world here is cruel. We are no longer well.) “Now everyone is going to be competing to find the best rhyme for ‘quarantine’ or ‘corona ’” mused Snail Kid  whose real name is Gregory Beaudin. Mr. Beaudin grew up speaking the native English of his Jamaican-born father  a reggae singer  as well as the French of his Montreal-born mother  a French teacher. The bilingual wordplay in the cavernous recording studio reflected how the coronavirus has changed not only how we live  but popular culture. It was also notable for another reason particular to Montreal: The group was rapping in Franglais or “Frenglish ” mixing English and French with artistic abandon that irks some purists. The Dead Obies are part of a new generation of young Quebec hip-hop artists who meld the language of Shakespeare and Voltaire with the urban poetry of Montreal’s street life and the bling-bling  drug-fueled themes of some American hip-hop. Other artists of this generation are Loud and FouKi. To their legions of fans  the groups give voice to the bilingual vernacular of a multicultural city  marinated by its past French and British rulers  the forces of globalization and successive waves of immigration. “Franglais rappers reflect that the younger generation in Quebec don’t care about old orthodoxies and are open to the world ” said Sugar Sammy  a Quebec comedian with Punjabi roots who became a global sensation after pioneering a bilingual comedy show. But they have also spawned a backlash in Quebec  a majority French-speaking province  where critics have castigated them as self-colonizers who are “creolizing” the French language and threatening its future. And they have lost out on lucrative federal government funding for Francophone artists because their content wasn’t French enough. Mathieu Bock-Côté  a sociologist and influential columnist at Le Journal de Montréal  said Franglais rappers were a worrying sign that the younger generation in Quebec had lost sight of the fragility of the French language in the city and were turning to English as a default to show emotion and express themselves. “Franglais is a slippery slope toward Anglicization ” he said. “These bourgeois-bohemian adolescents who think speaking English or Franglais will make Montreal into a New York are deluded because it is the French language that gives the city its cachet.” “Without French  Montreal would be Pittsburgh ” he added. Questions of language are inextricably bound up with identity in Quebec  a province of about 8.5 million people where the British minority exerted its language and culture after Quebec was ceded to Britain in 1763 following France’s defeat in the Seven Years’ War. French-speakers of a certain age can still recall being admonished by members of the Anglophone minority at factories to “speak white ” or speak English. Today  language laws require that French be the official language of government  business and the courts. Concerned that the Franglais greeting of “Bonjour-hi” was becoming too ubiquitous in Montreal shops and restaurants  the Quebec government in late 2017 passed a nonbinding resolution calling for shopkeepers to say only “Bonjour” instead. A French citizen was recently denied a certificate she needed to settle permanently in Quebec. Her offense? Writing a chapter of her doctoral thesis in English rather than in French. After an outcry  the right-leaning Quebec government granted her the document. Yet in recent years  Quebec’s influential language watchdog has shown some flexibility  alluding to the evolving nature of language. It ruled that using “grilled-cheese” on menus instead of the more long-winded “sandwich au fromage fondant” would not breach Quebec’s language rules  while cocktail  drag queen  and haggis were also deemed acceptable in French. At the same time  the watchdog has been successful at encouraging Quebecers to say “courriel” instead of the pervasive English word “email” used by many in France. Mr. Beaudin  who grew up in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve  a working-class neighborhood in the eastern part of Montreal  said the Dead Obies hadn’t set out to make a political statement. Rather  they were merely mimicking the language and sounds of Québécois French  where words and expressions like “c’est le fun” (it’s fun) and “mon chum” (my boyfriend) were commonplace. Brought up on English video games and Facebook  he said he and his friends didn’t have neuroses about language. Moreover  he argued  a society that attacked its artists was discriminatory  insecure and misguided. “You can be more creative when you are rapping in two languages ” he added. To make his point  he rapped a few lines from a Dead Obies song that switches midsentence from French to English: Je te jure que Billie Jean is not my lover Nope  nope C’est juste une fille que je meet sur le “E” dans le after hours (I swear to you that Billie Jean is not my lover. Nope  nope. It’s just a girl I meet on E at the after-hours.) As a biracial teenager in Montreal  Mr. Beaudin said he had been attracted to rappers like Eminem and Jay-Z and had turned to Franglais rap for cultural affirmation. Rapping in two languages spliced with street slang was also a way to revolt against a Québécois cultural elite dominated by white Francophone artists. But he said rapping in Franglais has come at a heavy cost. The group lost subsidies of about $18 000 on their second album from a national government fund for Francophone artists because it was 55 percent French and 45 percent English. The funding was predicated on an album having at least 70 percent French content. The equivalent Anglophone fund stipulated that French content on an album be no more than 50 percent  making them ineligible for that  too. “Now we count how many words we say in French or in English ” he said. “In a small domestic market like Quebec  artists need subsidies to survive.” Nicolas Ouellet  host of a popular music show on Radio-Canada  Canada’s leading French-language radio station  said Franglais rappers were largely omitted from commercial radio stations and sneered at for not being part of Quebec’s “folklore.” But  he said  “rather than bastardizing Québécois French  they are acting as a bridge between Quebec and the rest of North America.” Montreal has become among the most bilingual cities in North America  alongside Miami and Los Angeles. According to 2016 national census figures  about 18 percent of Canadians speak both English and French  with Quebec driving the bilingualism. While some guardians of the French language fear creeping bilingualism  the resistance to Franglais rap is more than just a question of language. FouKi  a popular Quebec rapper whose real name is Léo Fougères  observed that Franglais rapping didn’t just irritate those determined to preserve French. “My father will hear my raps and say to me  ‘Isn’t there a word for that in French?’” he said. “But other older people say to me  I don’t understand anything you say.” Nasuna Stuart-Ulin contributed reporting.

By Elaina Plott SWEETWATER  Fla. — The Miami-Dade Republican headquarters has the look and feel of a single-family home where the single family has an especial devotion to Donald J. Trump. Matching love seats open the space  with one positioned under watercolor portraits of the president and first lady  the other decorated with needlepoint American flag pillows. From the corner of the room  a particularly lifelike cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump keeps watch.

Ms. Jewett  a 71-year-old Cuban-American  has worked for the local G.O.P. for 18 years  and she insists she hasn’t seen so much enthusiasm in the party since the Reagan era. On one afternoon in late February  the telephone trilled with the numbing frequency of white noise — a barrage that began after Senator Bernie Sanders extolled elements of Cuba’s communist dictatorship on CBS’s “60 Minutes.” Now  the office is closed because of the coronavirus — Miami-Dade has nearly 4 500 confirmed cases  and on Wednesday  Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order after a conversation with Mr. Trump. Ms. Jewett said the crisis was “like a nightmare  like an old movie  like science fiction.” But she praised the president for his handling of it. “He’s covered every aspect ” she said. To spend any time among Republicans in South Florida is to be in an America as Mr. Trump would have it  where his support extends beyond his white working-class base and includes unabashed admiration from the wealthy  from immigrants (at least many from Cuba and Venezuela)  and from Jewish voters who thank him for the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. For Mr. Trump  scarred by the disapproval of many fellow New Yorkers  his newly declared home state offers a blissful safe space. And Florida has benefited: Mr. Trump has responded to Mr. DeSantis’s requests for personal protective equipment for health care workers and other needs  while other governors have complained about insufficient federal help. Of all the governors  Mr. Trump has found his kindred spirit in Mr. DeSantis  who for weeks marched to his own drum on the virus  refusing to close beaches or sound grave alarms  leading the state as if unencumbered by the sort of experts who now surround Mr. Trump. In his drive to ensure that the state remains red in November  South Florida has become a political ground zero. The region has eluded Republican presidential nominees for decades  a reality Mr. Trump felt acutely in 2016: His explosion in support across the state was nearly offset by Miami-Dade alone  where a crush of Republicans broke ranks to help Hillary Clinton easily carry the county. There are signs that Mr. Trump is poised to perform better here in November  particularly with Cuban-Americans who  after giving him the lowest share of their vote of the past three Republican nominees  are coming around to the president. The coronavirus hasn’t changed this  Republicans here say. For Trump supporters  the one thing more frightening than a pandemic is the idea of weathering it in a socialist country  something many of them believe Democrats are pushing America toward. Anxieties — the real and imagined  sincere and sinister — have long propelled Mr. Trump’s success. And now  as the Democratic Party veers further left on issues like health care and immigration  his ability to stoke them could be critical to piercing this blue stronghold of South Florida. If he succeeds  it would complete his coronation as the Florida Man of the modern Republican Party. Since his election  the president has held 10 rallies across the state. That Mr. Trump included Florida in his so-called “Thank You” tour in December 2016 was fitting: His victory scrambled long-held wisdom about what it takes to carry this perennial battleground. Mrs. Clinton may have tallied more voters than any Democratic nominee since Jimmy Carter in cities like Jacksonville  where a strong showing has historically been central to Democratic victory. But Mr. Trump so toppled turnout models in rural and blue-collar counties that it didn’t matter. Some 20 000 voters flocked to the Amway Center in Orlando for the president’s re-election campaign kickoff rally last summer  many of them for the same reasons. With Mr. Trump  they feel seen and emboldened after years of feeling belittled by the leadership in both parties. And when it comes to the coronavirus crisis  they don’t feel that Mr. Trump’s early dismissive attitude toward the threat was dismissive at all; rather  it was his attempt to “stay positive” and not incite panic. “I think that’s why President Trump has been really out front ” said Lee Green  a Republican in The Villages  a retirement community northwest of Orlando. “So that people will stay calm  and not be silly.” Few if any say they are concerned about Mr. Trump’s falsehoods or divisiveness. On one level  the president’s Florida base is much like his base anywhere else in the country. The difference here is that Mr. Trump reciprocates the obsession in full. Mr. Trump’s aspirations in Florida are intensely personal. It’s a large part of why his campaign has devoted resources to South Florida  why in November Mr. Trump held a rally in a county where Mrs. Clinton won 66 percent of voters three years before. For Mr. Trump  Broward County hits close to home. Some of the most recognizable names in his orbit  including his campaign manager  Brad Parscale  reside there. The city of Sunrise  where the president held his rally  is almost the precise midpoint between his beloved Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and the Trump National resort in Doral. Less than four weeks before the rally  he officially declared the former his new residence. Accordingly  he billed the event “a homecoming.” As Mr. Trump looks to bolster support  his Florida allies are “thrilled” that he himself can now contribute at the ballot box. “His base is solidly growing ” said Karen Giorno  the Trump campaign’s former chief strategist for the state. “And now that he and the first lady are residents of Palm Beach County instead of Manhattan  their votes will finally count in 2020.” Among voters in Miami-Dade County  Cuban-Americans have long been central to any Republican’s success  their loyalty tracing back to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. And come Election Day  they show up: In 2016  Cuban-Americans represented 6 percent of voters in Florida — a critical margin in a state whose winner is often determined by less than one percentage point. In Miami-Dade’s Cuban enclaves  Mr. Trump vastly underperformed past G.O.P. nominees. In 2012  Mr. Romney won Hialeah  a traditionally Republican city with the highest Cuban-American population in the country  by nine percentage points; four years later  Mr. Trump virtually tied with Mrs. Clinton there. In the heavily Cuban Miami suburb of Westchester  Mr. Trump’s support was eight points lower than Mr. Romney’s. At the time  many in the community were repelled by Mr. Trump’s “apparent anti-Hispanic rhetoric ” according to Dario Moreno  a pollster and associate professor of politics at Florida International University. Added to that were broader political shifts years in the making  with younger generations of Cuban-Americans increasingly leaning left and a growing number of older voters receptive to the warmer United States-Cuba relationship encouraged by President Barack Obama. But the last three years have seen a reversion  Dr. Moreno said. “There’s been a kind of return to the Republican Party from Cuban-Americans  mainly on the issue of Cuba and the more hard-line stance taken by Trump ” he said. At many points  Mr. Trump has tightened the longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba  reinstating the travel and business restrictions that Mr. Obama had loosened. While younger voters continue to oppose the embargo  Cuban-American support in Miami for Mr. Trump’s policies has substantially increased over all. Dr. Moreno  who is Cuban-American  said Mr. Trump today seemed “more popular” among the community “than McCain  Romney  and himself in 2016.” Carlos Gimenez  the mayor of Miami-Dade and a Cuban-American Republican  is among the converted. In 2016  Mr. Gimenez announced he would vote for Mrs. Clinton  arguing Mr. Trump lacked the “makeup” to be president. Now  Mr. Gimenez is all in. In January  the two-term mayor went on Twitter to announce his bid to unseat Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell  a Democrat  in the same post thanking Mr. Trump “for all you’ve done for our economy & to fight socialism.” Hours later  the president rewarded him with his “complete and total endorsement!” Asked to explain his change of heart  Mr. Gimenez demurred. “I’m not going to get into those reasons. The president has won me over ” he said. “His record speaks for itself.” Mr. Gimenez’s embrace of Mr. Trump is testament to how more and more Republican voters in Miami-Dade expect their candidate to support the president in the same way that those in  say  the Panhandle might. And if many of them were already coalescing around Mr. Trump  Mr. Sanders has only quickened their steps. At a winter gathering of the Women’s Republican Club of Miami  some fought tears when asked about Mr. Sanders  who  in an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired on Feb. 23  praised Fidel Castro for introducing a “massive literacy program” in Cuba. “The point is that I was in Cuba that happened ” said Lucy Pereda  76. “And what happened was not teaching people how to read and write. It was indoctrination.” Mr. Trump  however  “has been tough on dictatorships ” said the club’s 44-year-old president  Claudia Miro. “He’s been tough on Cuba. He’s been tough on Venezuela.” Such conversations are taking place all across South Florida — and not just among Cubans. Thousands of Venezuelans in Miami have already signaled their support for Mr. Trump’s stance against Nicolás Maduro  the country’s leftist leader  who has refused to cede power. But there are also voters in South Florida whose support for Mr. Trump is less a response to Democrats than it is an appreciation of his record itself. Like Cubans  Jewish Floridians are among the state’s most reliable voters  most of them concentrated south of Palm Beach County. Unlike Cubans  they tend to vote Democratic: Mr. Trump won 27 percent of their vote in 2016  three points less than Mr. Romney in 2012  according to exit poll data. Two years later  in his race for governor against Andrew Gillum  Mr. DeSantis proved his party’s ability to increase those margins  winning 35 percent of Jewish voters. Mr. Trump has zeroed in on this bloc with similar intensity  headlining the Israeli-American Council’s annual summit meeting in December in Broward County  where thousands of Jewish supporters cheered as the president said the U.S.-Israel relationship was “stronger now than ever before.” Irma Gordon  86  who runs the Jewish Republican Club of Broward  said many of her members liked Mr. Trump in 2016  but now  she emphasized  “everyone is for Trump.” Still  Ms. Gordon acknowledged that while she thinks more Jewish Floridians lean Republican today than they did in 2016  in part because of the president’s decisions such as moving the embassy to Jerusalem  it’s “not only about what Trump has done. It’s the way the Democratic Party …” She paused and shuddered. “All this trying to make us socialist and communist — the Democrats today  oh my goodness.” Ellen Motz  a retiree in Broward County  had been a Democrat all her life  founding her area’s Jewish Americans for Obama chapter and campaigning for Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Last summer  she became a Republican because of Mr. Trump. She felt Mr. Trump was truly working “for the people.” And when it came to the Democratic Party  she said  “the negativity started getting to me to the point that I was just ready to quit.” Ms. Motz admires the president even more in this “scary” moment. “I know he’s trying to make people feel better ” she said. And when Democrats say he should have focused on the virus earlier  she said  “I think  look at what he was dealing with at the time. All the impeachment hearings — that was all they could think about with all that was going on in the world.” Mr. Trump has almost no chance of winning the Jewish vote here outright. But if he can continue to increase his support among the disparate groups that make up South Florida  all while maintaining his hold on the rest of the state  the 2020 election cycle could be Florida’s final one as a battleground. For now  his supporters aren’t worried about the coronavirus affecting Mr. Trump’s chances in November. In South Florida  Mariela Jewett says  with all Democrats today “talking about socialism ” voters have other concerns top of mind. “Listen ” she said  furiously chewing on a peppermint  “I work too hard. I’m 71 and still working. I don’t want to give anyone my money — ” She’s interrupted when an older man opens the door at Miami-Dade’s G.O.P. headquarters. He’s looking for Trump merchandise  he says  “some bumper stickers  whatever you have.” Ms. Jewett explains that they’re fresh out. But the man lingers  and soon the strangers are spun up in conversation. “I’m almost 71 and this country wasn’t like this when I was young ” he says  shaking his head. “Something’s going on.” Ms. Jewett’s voice then nearly cracks. “Socialism!” she cries. “It’s here!” Updated April 13  2020  Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/us/politics/00florida-trump1/merlin_170300739_8b1ed8f1-03b8-4c52-b5f6-bd0026380aac-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/19/reader-center/author-Elaina-Plott/author-Elaina-Plott-thumbLarge.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/joe-biden-john-lewis.html, us politics, John Lewis  Civil Rights Leader  Endorses Biden, The endorsement was another example of the strong backing Joseph R. Biden Jr. enjoys from African-American leaders and voters., Supported by The endorsement was another example of the strong backing Joseph R. Biden Jr. enjoys from African-American leaders and voters. By Katie Glueck Representative John Lewis  an iconic civil rights leader and one of the nation’s most prominent black lawmakers  on Tuesday endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the 2020 presidential contest  in the latest illustration of Mr. Biden’s strength with many African-American voters. Mr. Lewis  Democrat of Georgia  called the former vice president “a friend  a man of courage  a man of conscience” and promised to “travel around America to support him.” He also expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of a woman of color on the Democratic ticket. The congressman  a veteran of some of the most significant moments in the history of the civil rights movement  including the Bloody Sunday march in Alabama and the 1963 March on Washington  announced in December that he had advanced pancreatic cancer. But in a call with reporters on Monday evening  he said that he wanted to campaign aggressively for Mr. Biden — though the coronavirus outbreak has shuttered the traditional campaign trail for now. Since then  Mr. Biden has sometimes struggled to break through  overshadowed by President Trump and the bully pulpit of the presidency  as well as by governors on the front lines of the crisis. “I know what it is to campaign hard and to work hard ” Mr. Lewis said  acknowledging that he faced some “problems now  but they will not be with me forever.” “And I will be out there working and campaigning for Joe Biden as president of the United States of America.” Mr. Biden has not yet clinched the Democratic nomination; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont continues to campaign too. But with Mr. Biden holding an almost insurmountable lead in delegates  his campaign has started the process of looking for a running mate. He has said he will pick a woman. Older black voters  in particular  revived Mr. Biden’s once-floundering candidacy and played a decisive role in propelling him to the cusp of the Democratic nomination. Some Democrats — including Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina  the highest-ranking African-American in Congress and a top Biden ally — have expressed a preference for a black woman on the ticket with Mr. Biden. “I think Vice President Biden should look around ” Mr. Lewis said  when asked if he believed Mr. Biden should select a woman of color. “It would be good to have a woman of color. It would be good to have a woman. It would be good to have a woman who looks like the rest of America.” Mr. Lewis noted that there are “plenty of able women. Black  white  Latino  Asian-American  Native American.” The time has “long passed ” he said  for making “the White House look like the whole of America.” Also on Tuesday  Senator Sherrod Brown  Democrat of Ohio  endorsed Mr. Biden. Mr. Brown  who has voiced skepticism about Mr. Biden in the past  was once considered a potential presidential candidate himself  but he passed on the 2020 race. He represents a critical general election battleground. Should Mr. Biden win the Democratic nomination  one of his biggest challenges will be energizing younger  more progressive voters  many of whom remain skeptical of him. Asked how Mr. Biden should engage younger black voters who are less enthusiastic about turning out for Mr. Biden  Mr. Lewis  who is 80  said simply that they faced a choice in elections  and  noting the sacrifices others had made for the right to vote  urged them to turn out. “If we fail to vote  we don’t count ” he said. But he also expressed concern about voting against the backdrop of a pandemic  in a nation that has struggled with voter suppression  saying that he worried about whether the country would have a “free” election. “I just hope that  in spite of whatever is going on now  that people will not be afraid to come out and vote ” he said. “We have to vote.” Updated April 13  2020  Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/us/politics/07biden-lewis1/07biden-lewis1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/reader-center/author-katie-glueck/author-katie-glueck-thumbLarge.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/idelle-weber-dead.html, arts, Idelle Weber  Who Stretched the Meaning of Pop Art  Dies at 88, One of the few women involved in the Pop Art movement  she captured the anonymity of corporate life in silhouettes. She later turned to realism., Supported by One of the few women involved in the Pop Art movement  she captured the anonymity of corporate life in silhouettes. She later turned to realism. By Jillian Steinhauer Idelle Weber  an artist who cast a critical eye on midcentury American consumerism with Pop art silhouettes of corporate workers and photorealist paintings of trash  died on March 23 in Los Angeles. She was 88. She had been in an assisted living facility  according to her daughter  Suzanne  who confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. A painter who experimented with sculpture and collage  Ms. Weber was one of the few women involved in the Pop movement of the 1950s and ’60s. She used brightly colored and patterned backdrops to highlight her anonymous  black-and-white figures of businessmen and brides  politicians and television-show characters  all appearing in arrested motion. Her bold  flat aesthetic fit into the Pop category  but her subject matter was different than Andy Warhol’s soup cans or Roy Lichtenstein’s blown-up comics. Ms. Weber was interested in how consumer culture codified social roles. For example  the couple in the painting “Bride and Groom” (1963–64) step into their future against a shade of blue that alludes to the luxury jeweler Tiffany’s. Her work “expanded the notion of what ‘Pop’ could be ” wrote Sid Sachs  the director of exhibitions at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia  in a catalog for a show of Ms. Weber’s work at Hollis Taggart gallery in New York in 2013. She achieved success despite the hurdles she faced as a woman in a largely male milieu. In 1957  for example  she tried to audit a class taught by the Abstract Expressionist Robert Motherwell. She went to see him with her portfolio  which he looked at approvingly. He then asked if she was planning to marry and have children  to which she responded yes. “He looked at me and he said  ‘It’s too bad  you’ll never keep working ’” she was quoted as saying in Ms. Sachs’s catalog. “And he didn’t let me in the class.” Motherwell was wrong: Ms. Weber got married  had children and kept working. In the 1970s  she pivoted from Pop to photorealism by painting close-ups of New York City food stalls and piles of trash. She went on to make tightly cropped details of gardens and patches of grass  before segueing to more expressionistic landscapes in dark tones. By 2000 Ms. Weber was known primarily as a realist  and her Pop work was largely forgotten. It was only about 2010  when Mr. Sachs curated the critically acclaimed exhibition “Seductive Subversion: Women Pop Artists  1958-1968” (originally titled “Beyond the Surface: Women and Pop Art 1958-1968”) that her early breakthroughs were rediscovered  once more hitting a cultural chord. Older pieces that she had kept in storage were bought by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York  which displayed its acquisition when it reopened last fall. Onlookers even speculated that the silhouetted imagery in the opening credits of the TV series “Mad Men” were based on her work. (Despite the visual similarities  the creators say they weren’t.) Ms. Weber’s art “perfectly captured a certain spirit in popular culture when it was being made  such that it became emblematic of that moment again ” Cathleen Chaffee  chief curator of the Albright-Knox Gallery  said in an interview. “She is an example of the experience that a lot of women artists went through  if they lived long enough to see the cycles of celebrity and fame  obliteration and forgetfulness  and then rediscovery and celebrity ” Ms. Chaffee added. Ms. Weber was born Tessie Pasternack on March 12  1932. Her father put her up for adoption after her mother died in childbirth. Her new parents  Julius Earl Feinberg  who worked in real estate  and Minnie (Wallach) Feinberg  a homemaker who had previously lived abroad  gave her the name Idelle Lois Feinberg. From their house in Wilmette  Ill.  north of Chicago  Minnie would take Idelle to the Art Institute of Chicago  where they would look at miniature period rooms  works by Edward Hopper and more. Idelle took to drawing at an early age  and her parents encouraged her by enrolling her in art classes. When she was 8  the family moved to Beverly Hills  Calif.  settling in as neighbors to Elizabeth Taylor. As a teenager she began frequenting the gallery of the dealer Frank Perls  who arranged for her to visit the private art collections of movie stars like Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price. Ms. Weber attended Scripps College in Claremont  Calif.  for a year before transferring to the University of California  Los Angeles  where she received her bachelor’s degree in art in 1954 and her master’s in it the next year. In 1956  one of her pieces was accepted into the open-call exhibition “Recent Drawings U.S.A.” at the Museum of Modern Art. (The collector Gertrude Mellon bought it.) Traveling to see the exhibition  Ms. Weber wound up staying in New York City for almost the rest of her life. Within her first few days there she babysat for Mark Rothko’s daughter and met her future husband  Julian Weber  a lawyer who went on to be president of the humor magazine National Lampoon. The couple married nine months later  in 1957. Mr. Weber died in 2006. Ms. Weber is survived by two children  J. Todd and Suzanne  and three grandchildren. Her husband’s job as a corporate lawyer and the skyscrapers in her new home city inspired much of Ms. Weber’s most noted work. “I was just amazed  you know  because they had fluorescent lights and men in business suits  but you saw only the silhouettes of these people at any hour ” she said in a documentary film accompanying the “Seductive Subversion” exhibition. “And all those buildings had giant escalators. You’d see these people coming down after work or going up at the beginning of the day  and I really loved it.” She connected with leading players in the New York art world  like the influential dealer Ivan Karp  and in 1962 she signed on with the Bertha Schaefer Gallery. Her first solo show took place the following January — just two months after Andy Warhol’s debut at Stable Gallery. Ms. Weber recalled that Mr. Warhol had seen almost all her exhibitions and had even tried to give her advice: On learning that she had painstakingly created her gridded backgrounds by hand  he suggested that she use a paint roller to make the process easier. Her response: “Nuance  Andy  nuance.” In 1964  Ms. Weber made “Munchkins I  II  and II ” a nearly 18-foot-long painting dramatizing the anonymity of corporate life. She also ventured into sculpture  arranging her office dramas in small  clear acrylic cubes and constructing three-dimensional silhouettes in Plexiglas and plastic  like the neon-inflected “Jump Rope” (1967-68). Her work was shown in Pop art surveys around the country. By the end of the decade  however  Ms. Weber and art’s mainstream had moved on. She returned to painting  re-creating photographs she had taken of fruit stands and garbage on New York City streets — the commercial products that Pop once celebrated now left to rot. She continued to show in galleries and museums  some of which acquired her art  among them the Art Institute of Chicago  the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She taught at New York University for more than a decade and then at Harvard. As Ms. Weber traveled abroad in the 1980s and ’90s  her subject matter and style shifted toward nature — gardens  grass  landscapes — while her brush strokes loosened. She began assembling  in 2000  an installation of more than 500 paintings  drawings  watercolors and prints of heads that she had made over the past half century. Titled “Head Room” and exhibited in 2004 by the Nassau County Museum of Art on Long Island  it was unlike anything she had done before. If there was one through line to Ms. Weber’s long and varied career  it was her close observation of the details of the world around her — what Ms. Chaffee called “the critical gaze of the real.” It’s present in her scenes of corporate life and in her swirling paintings of the horizon  which look like the work of different people. She spent her life exploring that impulse in many forms. “Art historians  art critics and dealers sometimes make it sound like an artist’s development is like a single thread ” Ms. Weber once observed. “More often it’s like a rope with several strands intertwined and revolving around one another.” She added  “This certainly has been the case for me.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/obituaries/07weber1/07weber1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/millennials-economic-crisis-virus.html, business, Young Adults  Burdened With Debt  Are Now Facing an Economic Crisis, , Young people who entered this financial downturn with fewer resources than previous generations are enduring pain. Evan Schade  26  and Kaitlyn Gardner  23  lost their jobs in Kansas City  Mo.  and have just over $1 000 between them.Credit...Shawn Brackbill for The New York Times Supported by By Nathaniel Popper The last time a serious economic downturn hit in 2008  Evan Schade was in high school and the crisis seemed like a news event that happened to other people. This time  as the coronavirus has brought the economy to its knees  it has become a personal affair. When nonessential businesses were closed last month in Kansas City  Mo.  where he lives  Mr. Schade  26  lost his job at a carpet store and almost all of the shifts in his second job at a coffee shop. His girlfriend  Kaitlyn Gardner  23  was laid off from a different coffee shop. The money they have in their bank accounts  just over $1 000  is enough to cover only April’s $800 rent check — forget about his $300 student loan payments or the health insurance he was hoping to finally sign up for. The couple have spent their time at home applying for unemployment and fruitlessly looking for new work. “I know so many people my age who are going through the exact same thing ” Ms. Gardner said. The youngest American adults are facing what is  for most of them  the first serious economic crisis of their working lives. By most measures  they are woefully unprepared. While the last few years were largely good ones for the American economy  that did little to help set millennials up with a solid financial foundation. Overloaded with credit card and student debt  and underrepresented in the housing and stock markets  they entered this uncertain period with significant obligations and few resources. Their position looks doubly precarious when measured against older generations today and relative to those generations when they were the same age  from 23 to 35 years old. Going into the financial crisis of 2008  Generation X was roughly the same age as millennials today  but had on average twice the total assets that millennials have now when all bank accounts  stocks and loans are added together  according to an analysis done for The New York Times by economists at the St. Louis Federal Reserve. Now members of Generation X  who are from 40 to 55 years old  are in a strong position relative to millennials  even after being battered by the 2008 crisis. They have about four times the assets and more than twice as much in savings as today’s youngest American adults. Those with college degrees  a minority of the youngest adults  are doing better on average than previous generations when they were the same age. But everyone else is doing significantly worse  according to a Pew Research Center analysis last year. “Even going into this situation  young adults were in a very precarious situation ” said Reid Cramer  who led the Millennials Initiative at New America  a left-of-center think tank. “A sudden shock is really going to have a pretty big impact on this generation.” The turmoil caused by the coronavirus has already brought out other generational divisions. College students partying on Florida beaches have earned the ire of older Americans who face graver health risks when youthful gatherings spread the virus. But while young adults may face fewer health problems  they are more vulnerable to the financial costs of the downturn. Millennials are much more likely to be involved in part-time work and the gig economy  according to government reports  and these have been hard hit. Such work generally provides few benefits to cushion the blow of bad times. The sudden disappearance of paychecks  combined with a wide array of monthly debt payments and the declines in any investments  is forcing some millennials to take desperate measures. Social media has been filled with discussions about how to best take money out of 401(k) retirement accounts to pay for rent. Dan Gamez  22  who lives with his parents near Boston  has been selling his video game consoles on eBay to make his upcoming car payment after losing his job at an AT&T store. “I’ve just been staying at home and playing video games  so I’m kind of upset I have to do this  but I have no choice ” he said. Andrew Lawson  29  was making $500 to $600 a week delivering food for DoorDash on Hawaii’s big island. After the state shut down nonessential businesses  most restaurants closed. In three days of work in one week  Mr. Lawson made less than $60  which wasn’t enough to cover the gas to get to Kona  the city with the work. “Nowadays I might get a $5 order from McDonald’s after three hours of waiting ” he said. Mr. Lawson has a 2-year-old and a pregnant wife  who does not work. They were down to eating plain noodles until he visited a food bank and got a bag of potatoes and some carrots. He has set up accounts on all the social networks to broadcast his need for work — any work. “Give me something I could feed my family with ” he said. “I don’t care what it is.” The inequality among millennials is even more evident when race is taken into account. Young black families at all educational levels have fallen further behind their white peers over the last two decades in measures like household wealth and homeownership  according to research from New America. “Over time  it is becoming more difficult for young families to accumulate wealth ” said William R. Emmons  the lead economist at the St. Louis Federal Reserve’s Center for Household Financial Stability. “We thought maybe they’d catch up later  but the current situation doesn’t give me much reason to believe that’s going to happen.” These disadvantages are already shaping the long-term prospects of young Americans. They are much less likely to be married  have children or own a house than Americans of a similar age in decades past. Ms. Gardner said that she and Mr. Schade eventually wanted to have a family and a house. But she said  “We’re both going to be in debt for a while  and having kids is just not feasible.” While there is a chance the downturn will be short  economists are assuming that the turmoil that has already happened will have long-term consequences for young households. The 2008 crisis made young Americans then more reluctant to invest in the stock market. Millennials today have  on average  only a third of the stock market holdings that Generation X did before the 2008 financial crisis  according to the data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. That means that young households have not enjoyed the market gains that came over the last decade. Today  the average member of Generation X has 10 times more wealth from the stock market than millennials. Jack Ankenbruck  25  who until last month made a living playing drums in a band in Nashville  began putting money into an investment account with the start-up Acorns last year and had gotten it up to $2 000 by February. The value of the account plunged by almost half in recent weeks  making him question his decision to put it there in the first place. “I’m thinking  ‘What if I’d just kept that $30 a week — I’d still have that money ’ and I could use it now ” said Mr. Ankenbruck  who has been trying to make some money playing concerts online. Jayci Cumberledge  23  in Amherst  Ohio  has no retirement accounts and spent her last $80 in savings to make her monthly car payment shortly after the gastro pub where she worked closed in mid-March. Ms. Cumberledge’s parents have also lost their jobs in the last few weeks — her father at a Ford factory  her mother driving a van for disabled children. That has made her aware of how much better prepared they were for this  she said  with a house they own and no rent payments to fall behind on. To cover the utility bills for her mobile home  Ms. Cumberledge borrowed $200 from a friend. She has since made some money by selling pictures of her feet to people with fetishes who found her online after she put a joking post on Twitter. “You compare it to the older generations — they worked up and saved money ” Ms. Cumberledge said. “It feels like I’m never going to have a stable job that has benefits and health insurance.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.

Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/business/07virus-millenials1/merlin_171133422_0d96df17-fd79-4e02-9347-f5534a36ce52-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-nathaniel-popper/author-nathaniel-popper-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/business/00virus-millennial2-sub/merlin_171155727_b66bebd3-5719-469e-a45f-b6e635a6b058-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

They could help many communities weather the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak., Supported by A new study examines the millions of small digital businesses. They could help many communities weather the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. By Steve Lohr This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series  which examines technological  economic  social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve. In the vast ocean of modern online commerce  Candis Jones  who designs and makes women’s jewelry  is a minnow. No venture capitalist will ever come knocking on her door in Westerville  Ohio. But with skill and hard work  digitally amplified by her website  online store and Instagram account  Ms. Jones has transformed a basement craft project into a healthy little business. All that is in doubt now as the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak worsens. Her business has not fallen off a cliff yet  down about 20 percent so far but slowing further in the last couple of weeks. Every sale  Ms. Jones said  is cause for “celebration” and “a vote for us to make it through this.” There are millions of small  digitally enabled ventures like hers across America. New research  based on data from 20 million websites  found that these small-scale entrepreneurs generate significant spillover benefits to their communities. The analysis also concluded that counties with more of these ventures experienced stronger recoveries from the last recession than elsewhere  suggesting that “these small web businesses can be an important buffer for individuals and local communities facing economic challenges ” said Marcela Escobari  an economic development expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution  who was not involved in the new study. The new analysis  conducted by researchers at Arizona State University and the University of Iowa  is based on a data set assembled and provided by GoDaddy  a large retailer of internet domain names and a website-hosting service. The company is making the data publicly available on a website with quarterly and later monthly updates. So while the analysis predates the coronavirus outbreak  the regularly refreshed data should help track how a little-studied sector of the economy weathers the downturn. The new data  the researchers said  adds an important dimension to understanding the digital economy. It is  they said  a counterpoint to recent studies that show the clustering of leading-edge technology  investment and employment in a handful of superstar cities. “While that’s true  there is also this digitally enabled economic activity at the grass-roots level that we haven’t really been able to see clearly before ” said Karen Mossberger  a professor of public policy at Arizona State. The data set from GoDaddy includes information on its customers combined with third-party data and surveys  all stripped of personally identifying information. It includes estimates of website activity like traffic and links  location by county and ZIP code  and the purpose — a commercial site  a nonprofit or for personal or family use. Each active website  in GoDaddy’s labeling  is a “venture.” An estimated three-quarters are business related. Its intent  GoDaddy said  is that researchers and lawmakers will use the data to inform public policy to nurture small web-enabled entrepreneurs. The company said the initiative was mainly an “educational research project ” though GoDaddy stands to gain if the ranks of web entrepreneurs grow. The company shared the data set initially with Ms. Mossberger and Caroline Tolbert  a professor at the University of Iowa  who are scholars of “digital participation” in economic  political and civic activity. GoDaddy did provide modest grants to the universities for support costs like compensating graduate students working on the study. The company  the academics said  had no say in their research. The study is now a working paper  written with a third co-author  Scott LaCombe  a doctoral graduate student at Iowa. They plan to publish their research in scholarly journals and present it at conferences. Their analysis sought to tease out the effect on communities of web ventures. For example  they found that each highly active venture — like Ms. Jones’s site — per 100 people added $331 to the growth in the median household income in a county over a two-year period. The effect  the researchers said  holds up even after stripping out factors like household income  education level  ethnicity  geography and the local mix of industries. Digital participation research  Ms. Tolbert said  has often focused on access to broadband technology and its impact on communities. The new data  she said  affords a deeper look. “It’s a measure of community human capital ” Ms. Tolbert said. “Having the technology is one thing  but can they use it? This gives us a powerful new window into local economies.” For economic development  the data may offer a fresh perspective on where technology fits in. Trying to lure a big tech company with tax breaks to make an investment may be misguided  Ms. Mossberger said. A better option for most communities  she said  could well be programs geared to helping tiny ventures and skills development. In recent years  academic  government and corporate researchers have experimented with anonymized data from bank and credit card accounts  credit-rating agencies and other sources to try to get a more detailed picture of the small-scale entrepreneurial activity. Some of that recent research suggests a sharp increase in female and minority entrepreneurs in a trend that cannot be captured by standard government surveys alone. “Traditional sources are not accurately reflecting who the new entrepreneurs are ” said Claire Kramer Mills  director of community development analysis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A study  sponsored by American Express  estimated that the number of businesses owned by African-American women increased nearly 50 percent from 2014 to 2019. A Maryland cheesecake business  founded last year by two sisters  is one of them. Nikki Howard and Jaqi Wright were federal workers on furlough during the 35-day government shutdown that ended in late January 2019. During the budget standoff  Ms. Howard baked cheesecakes for a church social. Her mother tried a piece and told her that it tasted good enough to sell. The out-of-work sisters decided to give it a try  and they named their fledgling venture the Furlough Cheesecake. They bought the domain name  built the website using simplified templates and set up online billing and payment accounts by themselves. Ms. Howard’s daughters  both in their 20s  created the company logo and handled the Facebook  Instagram and Twitter outreach. It got noticed  and appearances on local television and “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” followed. Last year  the sisters  who quit their government jobs  sold nearly 6 000 cheesecakes. The most popular lines sell for $35 each plus $5 for packed-in-dry-ice shipping. So far  their baking has been done in church kitchens and at a commercial bakery that allowed them to use its ovens on nights and weekends. Their family and friends have all pitched in  mainly as volunteers  to help with baking and packing. Before the coronavirus outbreak  Ms. Howard and Ms. Wright were looking for a permanent space to combine baking  freezing and packing  with room for a retail shop as well. But those plans are on hold now. Sales have fallen 50 percent. They have taken inventory out of their freezers and donated cheesecakes to a home for older people and to a local police station. The sisters have looked at government loan programs for businesses affected by the pandemic. But theirs is a new company without full-time employees. They don’t yet own buildings or equipment — assets to serve as collateral for loans. “We don’t seem to quite qualify yet ” Ms. Howard said. Most small online ventures  according to the GoDaddy data  remain side hustles. About one-fifth of the entrepreneurs surveyed said their web businesses were their main source of income. But more than half said their web ventures generated some household income. For Ms. Jones in Ohio  her necklaces have found a market with women like her  mothers who wanted something attractive yet sturdy enough to withstand a toddler’s tug. Her business is a pillar of income  along with her husband’s salary as a high school art teacher  to support their household with two young children. Total sales last year were more than $100 000. She supports a full-time contractor to help make the jewelry. Her offerings  mostly priced from $17 to $35  could be pitched as inexpensive pick-me-up purchases in bad times. But she has cut back her online promotions as the pandemic has spread  not wanting to strike an insensitive note. “The health and success of my business is so important to my family and our livelihood  but this virus is taking people’s lives ” Ms. Jones said Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

By Kevin Draper The Ultimate Fighting Championship plans to hold a pay-per-view event on tribal land in Central California this month  an attempted end run around widespread federal and state guidelines against holding large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic  according to three people familiar with the decision. Even as most sporting events have ground to a halt worldwide because of the highly contagious virus  Dana White  the U.F.C. president  has insisted he can safely hold mixed martial arts events without fans in attendance. “This place where this fight is going to be on April 18 I have locked up for two months  so I’m going to continue to pump fights out ” White told ESPN on Monday  though he declined to say exactly where. The location will be the Tachi Palace Casino Resort near Lemoore  Calif.  about 40 miles south of Fresno  according to the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity because White had not announced the venue. The casino  which closed the night of March 20 because of the pandemic  is on land belonging to the Tachi-Yokut Tribe  part of the federally recognized Santa Rosa Indian Community. A representative of the Tachi Palace Casino Resort could not immediately be reached for comment  and the U.F.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The location was first reported by Jeff Sherwood  the co-host of the “Behind the Pay Wall” M.M.A. podcast. The U.F.C. postponed three events in March and April as stay-at-home orders became increasingly widespread and states began requiring nonessential workers to stay home. Nevada  where the U.F.C. is based  is under a statewide stay-at-home order until at least April 30 — it has even shut down the Las Vegas casino industry. The Association of Ringside Physicians  which represents safety personnel in combat sports  has urged the suspension of all combat sports. “Any combat sport taking place during this global pandemic places the athletes  officials  and anyone else involved in the event under unnecessary risk of infection and transmission of Covid-19 ” the association said in a statement. “In addition  combat sports athletes often require medical attention after a bout  and we do not wish to see any additional strain on an already overwhelmed medical system.” By holding the event on tribal land  the U.F.C. is not subject to California’s executive order mandating that people stay at home. The fights on the card also do not need to be sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission  which normally regulates mixed martial arts events in the state. The commission has canceled all fights through May 31. “The commission echoes the guidance of California Governor Gavin Newsom  the Department of Public Health  local health officials  and the recommendations of the Association of Ringside Physicians regarding the cancellation of events where people may be at risk of contracting Covid-19 and encourages the industry to do the same ” the California athletic commission said in a statement. “The commission will not participate in the U.F.C. event on April 18  regardless of the event location.” U.F.C. 249 was originally scheduled to be held on April 18 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn  and to be headlined by a lightweight championship bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson — one of the U.F.C.’s most anticipated matchups in years. But after Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York restricted mass gatherings and the New York State Athletic Commission announced it wouldn’t authorize the event  White said the U.F.C. would go forward at a different location. On Monday  White said that Nurmagomedov  now at home in Dagestan  Russia  was out of the fight and would be replaced by Justin Gaethje in the interim lightweight title matchup. Nurmagomedov and Ferguson have been scheduled to fight each other five times since 2015  but each plan fell apart because of injury  illness and now the pandemic. To book any fights involving athletes who cannot travel to the United States  White has said he secured an island but has not disclosed where. Though the U.F.C. produces all of its own events  the April 18 pay-per-view event will be sold by ESPN+  ESPN’s streaming service  and the preliminary card will be scheduled for one of ESPN’s cable channels. An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday. Tribal casinos  including the Tachi Palace Casino Resort  regularly host mixed martial arts and boxing matches with the full support and participation of state athletic commissions. World Extreme Cagefighting  a mixed martial arts company founded in 2001  held most of its first two dozen events at the Tachi Palace Casino Resort. It was purchased in 2006 by Zuffa  then the parent entity of the U.F.C.  and merged with the U.F.C. in 2010. But tribal casinos also sometimes host mixed martial arts events that cannot be sanctioned elsewhere  a form of venue shopping that most state athletic commissions view unfavorably.

By Tyler Kepner The view is not bad from Eric Jokisch’s 16th-floor apartment in Seoul  South Korea. He can see cherry blossoms in bloom in the trees  and can locate the former stadium of his baseball team  the Kiwoom Heroes. But Jokisch cannot leave. “It’s kind of like you’re in prison ” he said in a telephone interview over the weekend. “You see everybody else out there walking around and you wish you could be out there.” Jokisch  who pitched for the Chicago Cubs in 2014  is in self-isolation as the Korean Baseball Organization — with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak dissipating in South Korea — cautiously stirs to life again. Forty-one floors above Jokisch  another Heroes pitcher  Jake Brigham  is also all alone  fulfilling a government requirement of a 14-day self-isolation period for overseas arrivals. The pitchers were with their families in the United States before coming to South Korea. “I’ve got a foam roller and some weights and bands  but honestly it’s hard to even self-motivate enough to get to do that after a week of doing it every day ” said Brigham  who pitched for the Atlanta Braves in 2015. “I’m doing as much as I can to try and keep some sort of muscles in my body. But it’s challenging for sure.” The return of baseball — the K.B.O. season was originally to start on March 28 — remains somewhat precarious in South Korea. The country had a one-day peak of 909 new cases of Covid-19 on Feb. 29  and while it has significantly reduced the spread — to just 64 new cases on March 22 — there are indications this month of a slight uptick. The K.B.O. plans to resume its exhibition schedule on April 21  but for now its teams are staging intrasquad games that are streamed online. Some players wear masks on the field. “It would be weird to wear it during an intrasquad or a practice if I’m throwing ” said the Hanwha Eagles’ Chad Bell  a former Detroit Tigers pitcher who is in self-isolation in Daejeon  South Korea. “But if that’s something they want us to do at the time  then yeah. I’ve got 30 or 40 of them in my room that I’ve received from the team  so I’ve got them to wear when I’m ready to get out of the apartment in the next few days.” In mid-February  when the pandemic hit South Korea hardest  the Eagles were in Phoenix for spring training. At that point  Bell said  his league’s schedule was upended  but Major League Baseball was proceeding as planned. “I was like  ‘If I’d have been playing in the States  I’d be playing ’” Bell said. “Now I’m sitting here and we’re going to be playing well before them. But when it first started  we were like  ‘There’s no way.’” K.B.O. teams do not train in the same area  and while most players returned to South Korea when the league shut down in early March  five of the league’s 10 teams allowed their foreign players to return to their homes. Those who did — like Bell  who went to Tennessee  and Brigham and Jokisch  who went to Florida — were tested for Covid-19 when they arrived in South Korea in late March  and then began their 14 days of isolation. “The teams check everybody’s temperature every day when they get to the field  just trying to do everything they can to monitor everybody’s health  because as we saw in the States  in the N.B.A.  one guy gets it and they have to shut it down ” Bell said. “They’re being very proactive over here  but still that’s the main worry: One guy gets it  and then you’re basically on hold for three weeks right in the middle of the season.” With their lives on hold  the players have turned to their translators for food and grocery delivery. They cook for themselves  talk to their families as soon as they wake up and again before bed  and search for ways to pass the time. Jokisch watched the Netflix series “Tiger King” on his overseas flight  and is trying to get into the “Ozark” series. His translator brought him a “Toy Story” puzzle  and he is almost finished. But the lull of self-isolation comes with a nagging sense of the unknown  especially for pitchers. “I’ve rarely taken two weeks off from throwing in general  let alone when we’re pretty much ready to get going ” Jokisch said. “We just don’t have anything to go off of. I guess you just have to listen to your arm and your body  but I know we need to push it as fast as we can to get ready to go  because this season could start here soon. “I can’t imagine what it’s like for guys in the States. They have no idea right now. What exactly do you do? Do you take time completely off? Do you try to stay going? It’s such a wild time.” If the season were to begin with games played without spectators  it would greatly stifle the atmosphere in a league known for sustained chanting and singing by fans  no matter the score. But  Brigham said  the league would still be an appealing alternative for American fans craving baseball. “I understand there’s a lot going on and it’s terrible ” said Brigham  who is starting his fourth season in the league. “But the K.B.O. has wanted to boost their exposure worldwide  and if they can do it in a safe manner  there’s a real opportunity for the Korean players to have that worldwide exposure  so people can understand there are some incredibly talented people in this league.” Some U.S. major leaguers have gone to South Korea and returned with a higher profile  like first baseman Eric Thames of the Washington Nationals and pitcher Josh Lindblom  who signed a three-year  $9.125 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in December after winning the K.B.O.’s Most Valuable Player Award. But the league also has budding South Korean stars — Brigham mentioned teammates like shortstop Kim Ha-seong and center fielder Lee Jung-hoo — who could be major leaguers someday. In a season unlike any other  they could emerge as more than an occasional Twitter curiosity. “The foreign guys  we’ve had our opportunity  we’ve all played in the big leagues for the most part ” Brigham said. “I’m over here providing for my family  and I love the opportunity. It’s been incredible.” He added: “But for the Korean guys  if they can get American fans to really see them for more than just the occasional bat flip that comes across on Pitching Ninja ” he added  referring to a popular baseball Twitter account  “it could be really good for these guys.” In the meantime  in that 57th-floor apartment high above Seoul  Brigham trains on his own for a season he expects to be played  but without a scheduled opening day. Down on the 16th floor  Jokisch does the same  waiting and wondering when the league will really get going. “It seems like early May  but it also seemed like late April ” Jokisch said. “Every week it kind of gets pushed back. The cases are down quite a bit here  but it’s just about trying to figure out when it’s OK. And that’s kind of the problem all over the place: ‘When is it OK?’” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/sports/06virus-kepner-korean-1/06virus-kepner-korean-1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/dining/corned-ham.html, dining, The Lure and Lore of Corned Ham  a Salty Slice of North Carolina, Holidays bring a hankering for a traditional dish that the chef Bill Smith has devoted himself to making popular again., Supported by Holidays bring a hankering for a traditional dish that the chef Bill Smith has devoted himself to making popular again. By Brett Anderson CHAPEL HILL  N.C. — When Bill Smith moved here in the late 1960s  he couldn’t find corned ham  a staple in New Bern  the coastal town where he grew up. “This would not do ” said Mr. Smith  the longtime chef at Crook’s Corner and a pioneer in the modern revival of Southern cuisine. His father came to the rescue. “My dad would send me hams on the bus from the Pak-A-Sak in New Bern ” he said  referring to a local grocery. “It would be under there with the luggage  in a beat-up cardboard box.” Traditional corned ham is simply a fresh ham cured in salt. Unlike smoked and dry-cured Southern hams  it is rarely found outside two small pockets of the Eastern Seaboard: St. Mary’s County  Md.  where it’s used primarily as the basis for stuffed hams  and eastern North Carolina  where hog farming has been a linchpin of the local economy for generations. It’s the one region where it’s still common to find people serving unembellished corned ham. Some Carolina home cooks boil their hams and use the rich broth  known as potlikker  to braise collard greens. Slow-cooked in the oven  as Mr. Smith advises  the dish is an eye-popping  deeply seasoned pork roast you won’t soon forget. “It’s just so perfect and succulent  which is hard for a ham ” said Vivian Howard  the chef and television personality who runs two restaurants in Kinston  near where she grew up. A 40-minute drive from New Bern  Kinston is also  Ms. Howard pointed out  “corned ham country.” Her father made corned hams when she was growing up  and the Piggly Wiggly around the corner from her office still sells them during the winter holidays. “The bulk of what we sell is on Thanksgiving and Christmas ” said Charles Rollins  the meat director for 38 Piggly Wiggly stores in eastern North Carolina  “but they’re not as popular as they were when I was young.” He said the coronavirus crisis is preventing his stores from carrying them again around Easter  as they normally do. Mr. Smith  who is 71 and was once described by the local alternative newspaper Indy Week as “arguably our state’s most beloved chef ” has made reversing that trend a pet cause. He believes the dish is too delicious to consume only on the holidays  much less to let disappear. “This is the best ham in the world ” he wrote in his 2005 cookbook  “Seasoned in the South.” The book’s corned ham recipe is based on lessons he received from Gwen Lassiter  who made them for Pak-A-Sak. “It used to be that you could just go to the store and buy them anytime you wanted one ” Mr. Smith said. “When that went away  my father said I had to learn to make them myself. And Gwen is who made them for him.” The lessons helped create an ambassador. If you Google “corned ham ” many of the top results will be articles by or about Mr. Smith. One is an essay the chef wrote for Southern Cultures  a quarterly magazine  that includes an artist’s depiction of him as a ham  holding a can of his favorite beverage  Pabst Blue Ribbon. Mickey Hudson  an owner of Morty Pride Meats  in Fayetteville  said his family’s company didn’t make corned hams when his father founded the business in 1970. They started to roughly 25 years ago  when there was a resurgence in demand for the hams. “People started wanting them again  for some reason ” he said. Ms. Howard said her father  like many people in the region  would make one corned ham and one smoked ham every fall as a way to preserve part of a slaughtered hog. She didn’t give corned ham much thought after she became a chef. Then  in 2012  she went to a party at the home of Ashley Christensen  a well-known chef in Raleigh. Mr. Smith had brought one of his hams  which was particularly memorable for its crisped  brown cap of fat. “I remember when he came in  everyone was like  ‘Hey  Bill’s got the ham!’” Ms. Howard recalled. “And then everyone tapped the skin.” The ham quickly disappeared  as is typical at large gatherings  Mr. Smith said. “If you’re near it  you just can’t let it alone.” (Ms. Howard later invited him to help recreate the ritual of slaughtering and breaking down a hog  then corning a ham  in an episode of her PBS show “A Chef’s Life.”) For home cooks  particularly those who have stocked up for a self-quarantine  the most challenging part of making a corned ham is clearing space in your refrigerator to fit a 15- to 20-pound ham for 10 days. (You can also mail-order a corned ham from Morty Pride.) The best argument for making the effort is the finished ham. The savory meat keeps for at least two weeks  and the leftovers are versatile: salty enough to flavor beans and cooked greens  but also looser-grained and more tender than other hams  making the meat suitable for tacos  jambalaya and pulled-pork sandwiches. “It makes wonderful ham salad ” Mr. Smith said. One morning in February  Mr. Smith was preparing a corned ham to bake in the kitchen at Crook’s Corner for a dinner he was hosting at the restaurant that evening. He wore a version of the outfit — faded bluejeans  T-shirt and a baseball hat with a Human Rights Campaign logo on it — that he wore to work every day for three decades before retiring last year. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to make ” he said of the ham. He pointed to incisions he’d cut along the hip and shank bones 10 days earlier. “You ram salt as far as you can push into those. And then you pour salt all over it — it doesn’t have to be thick  but it does have to be all over.” He put the ham  which had soaked in water overnight  on a low rack over a half-inch of water in a large roasting pan. He pressed parchment paper over the meat  sealed the pan with tin foil  and put it in a 325-degree oven. He cooked the 23-pound ham for 20 to 25 minutes per pound — “you want it falling off the bone ” Mr. Smith said — until 90 minutes before it was finished  when its internal temperature neared 150 degrees. At that point  he removed the foil and parchment  turned the oven temperature up to 375 and returned the ham to the oven. The increased heat turned the top layer of fat into something like pork cracklings. “Everyone wants a piece of that ” said Andrew Ullom  the chef and co-owner of Union Special Bread  a bakery and cafe in Raleigh. Mr. Ullom  who is from Ohio  learned how to cook corned ham from Mr. Smith. “The flavor of it to me is much more reminiscent of the pulled pork eastern North Carolina is known for ” he said. He is among the North Carolina chefs who  inspired by Mr. Smith  are making corned ham into something it rarely was before: a restaurant dish. At Union Special Bread  corned ham is served over grits with red-eye gravy (made with reduced coffee and ham drippings) as a monthly brunch special. Lucky diners get a piece of crunchy skin with their order. “Tomorrow we’re going to have hot corned ham burritos with potlikker barbecue sauce ” Mr. Ullom said. (Union Special Bread is open only for takeout because of the coronavirus.) Matt Fern  who  like Mr. Ullom  is a former longtime employee of Ms. Christensen  plans to serve a corned ham Reuben with braised cabbage and chowchow at the deli he is hoping to open in Raleigh next spring  on the property of the new Longleaf Hotel. “I still remember the first bite of corned ham I ever had ” Mr. Fern said. It was at the same party attended by Ms. Howard. “The rule for that party was  ‘When Bill shows up  follow him and eat whatever he brings.’ ” While Mr. Smith is no longer cooking at Crook’s Corner  he remains a nurturing presence in the Research Triangle’s restaurant community  as well as a public figure. “The last year  I’ve been so busy  traveling  cooking for benefits and events ” he said. “My calendar is horrifying.” Mr. Smith is vocally progressive and politically active. He was arrested at a Moral Monday protest organized by the Rev. William J. Barber II  a North Carolina minister and activist  in response to an array of conservative state legislation in 2013. And he remains close with Crook’s mostly Mexican-American kitchen staff. “What kept me going all those years  frankly  was all these delightful people I was working with ” he said. “Because you know  in a restaurant  you might as well be in a coal mine. It’s relentless — 80-hour weeks.” Mr. Smith has been self-isolating in his Chapel Hill house in response to the coronavirus  riding his bicycle when he gets the chance. He is worried about his unemployed friends in the hospitality business. “No one has any money ” he said. Crook’s Corner is closed because of the health crisis. Although the restaurant is synonymous with Mr. Smith  he was never an owner. It was opened in 1982 by Gene Hamer and Bill Neal  a chef revered for marrying traditional Southern recipes and French technique. Mr. Smith got his start as a chef working for Mr. Neal  and became head chef in 1991  when Mr. Neal died of AIDS. Mr. Smith was regarded by some as an interloper. “It took a good while for people to accept me ” he said. Before he began cooking  he recalls  he was “a very good hippie” and a founder of Cat’s Cradle  an influential local music club that celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. His collection of rock-tour shirts  many of them sauce-stained  can be found in the Southern Folklife Collection at the University of North Carolina. “I was never a chef’s-whites guy ” he said. Over the years  Mr. Smith created new standards at Crook’s Corner  like fried oysters with garlic mayonnaise and honeysuckle sorbet. He is asked to make Atlantic Beach Pie  a lemon pie with a saltine crust  so often that he refers to it as “that stupid pie.” Corned ham was never a regular menu item at Crook’s. “We’d do it as a special a few times a year  usually on a Saturday  when we knew there would be enough people to eat it up ” he said. “It had a following.” Mr. Smith shared his corned ham recipe with Justin Burdett  the chef who replaced him when new owners took over the restaurant from Gene Hamer  its previous proprietor. Built inside a former fish market  the restaurant has not visibly changed under its new owners  Gary Crunkleton and Shannon Healy  both of whom own local bars. It’s still a casual bistro with a tile-lined bar  and the work of local artists hangs on the walls. Mr. Smith quickly took to Mr. Burdett  a 37-year-old Georgia native with skull tattoos on both sides of his head. “I was so afraid someone was going to come prancing in in a toque ” Mr. Smith said. “Justin is so not that.” After cooking his ham  Mr. Smith changed into a collared shirt for dinner and rolled up his sleeves to carve the ham. Seven friends passed around serving bowls of grits and collard greens at a long table in the Crook’s Corner dining room. “The best way to eat corned ham is to pick off the top of it  right when it comes out of the oven  before you tell anyone it’s ready ” said Sheri Castle  a local food writer and one of the guests. She tested the recipes for Mr. Smith’s book. Ms. Castle pointed out the ham’s similarities to turkey. “You have dark meat and white meat  juicy parts and less juicy parts.” “It’s the perfect eastern North Carolina supper ” said Mr. Smith  who made a “stupid pie” for dessert. After dinner  Mr. Smith put on his baseball hat and walked over to Cat’s Cradle  as he did after dinner shifts for decades. Archers of Loaf  his favorite local band  was playing. He seemed to run into a friend or a fan every few minutes. Scott Smith  the owner of a local bike shop (and no relation)  embraced Mr. Smith  and excitedly introduced him to his friends. “It’s Bill Smith!” he said. “He makes corned ham.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram  Facebook  YouTube and Pinterest.

You could even lose the asparagus., Supported by A Good Appetite You could use any kind of nuts or semifirm cheese in this nutty  cheesy bright spring salad. You could even lose the asparagus. By Melissa Clark Judging by the pinking of my neighborhood in cherry and magnolia blossoms  Covid-19 can’t stop spring. And this means vegetables like ramps  green garlic and asparagus have been making their way into the markets  bringing a needed relief from those wintry pantry staples we’ve all been relying on. I may have to wait on a snaking line six feet away from the person ahead of me to get some  but it will be thrilling when I do. Of all the spring produce  asparagus is what I’m most excited about  with verdant  fried egg-topped  Hollandaise-slathered visions crowding my head. On the lighter side  there will also be plenty of plump  steamed stalks drizzled with olive oil and eaten out of hand. Sometimes  I’ll get fancy and toss the spears with herbs  cheese and nuts for a slightly more elaborate salad. In a perfect  “I can just run to the store for an ingredient” world  I would dress my salad with a lemony shallot vinaigrette  grated young Manchego or pecorino  and top it with toasted pistachios. That’s what I did when I first made this recipe a few weeks ago  and it was a paragon of springtime loveliness — fresh  sweet  tangy and crunchy from the nuts  which added yet another shade of green to the plate. Satisfying enough for a light lunch or dinner when rounded out with some crusty bread  it was also excellent as a side dish to roast chicken or fish. But  given the moment we are in  the best part about it may just be that like most salads  it’s extremely flexible. You can use vinegar or lime juice instead of the lemon. Any semifirm variety of cheese that you can grate will work: Cheddar  Gouda  even Parmesan (though that will add more salt  so you might want to use less of it in the dressing). Whatever allium you’ve got — scallions  red onions  a clove of garlic — can stand in the for the shallot. Even the asparagus isn’t strictly necessary. Broccoli or broccolini would be an excellent substitute  giving the salad a similar crisp juiciness to asparagus when steamed. Does it feel strange to give a recipe for asparagus salad and then write that the asparagus is negotiable? Maybe. But it’s also practical and  I hope  helpful. Then  when you do get your hands of some gorgeous  purple-tipped asparagus  this recipe will be here  waiting for you.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/dance/trisha-brown-roof-piece.html, arts dance, A Home Version of Trisha Brown’s ‘Roof Piece ’ No Roof Required, Communication across distance is the essential component of this 1971 dance  Brown’s company has found. You and your friends can try  too., Supported by Communication across distance is the essential component of this 1971 dance  Brown’s company has found. You and your friends can try  too. By Brian Seibert This was supposed to be a big year for the Trisha Brown Dance Company  founded 50 years ago. In early March  the troupe flew to France to begin a sold-out anniversary tour. The first few shows went great. Then came the wave of coronavirus cancellations  and the dancers found themselves on the last American Airlines flight from Paris to New York. Scattered across the country — or in one case  back home in Australia — the dancers did what separated groups of every kind are doing: They met up virtually. They checked in on one another  commiserated about the canceled shows and started floating ideas about how they might continue to work remotely. One option quickly rose to the top: “Roof Piece.” “Roof Piece” is a work that Brown  who died in 2017  first performed in 1971. She and some colleagues scattered themselves across the water-tower-capped roofs of SoHo and played a dance version of the game telephone. One dancer executed a series of semaphore-like movements  which the dancer on the next roof over tried to copy exactly  and so on down the line. Spectators  stationed atop buildings  could follow the transmission and the errors  the inevitable decay in the signal that Brown intended the exercise to expose. People who didn’t know what was going on might also take notice  and that was part of the plan  too. That’s why the dancers all wore red. Like many of Brown’s early works — for example  “Man Walking Down the Side of a Building” — “Roof Piece” is both simple and radical. Brainstorming about how to reproduce it virtually  the dancers immediately ran into a snag: Not everyone had access to a roof. So they decided that a roof wasn’t essential to the piece; communication across distances was. The original “Roof Piece” was inspired by the follow-the-leader copying in dance classes and rehearsals  a mode of transmission fundamental to how dancers learn. With all the dance and yoga instruction proliferating online now — all that imitation via screens — a virtual “Roof Piece” seems right for the moment. What’s more  as the company dancer Jamie Scott said  doing “Roof Piece” inside felt “like a nod of solidarity to people who are also confined.” So that’s what the troupe did  recording the result  now called “Room/Roof Piece ” and polishing it with some editing before posting the video on social media. In another nod of solidarity  the company now encourages people at home to try their own virtual “Room/Roof Piece.” First  invite some friends to a meeting on a videoconferencing platform. (The dancers used Zoom.) Then choose the order of transmission: who is leader  who is No. 2  No. 3 and so on. The leader starts with a simple greeting  a wave of the hand. The rest of the motions are up to you  whatever you think “semaphore-like” means. (“Joint articulation and parallel and perpendicular lines ” Brown further specified.) A deep squat is the signal for the last person in line to take over as leader  reversing the flow. When that new leader wants it all to end  another squat is the sign. Figuring out how to make this all work on Zoom took the Brown dancers some trial and error. In the rooftop version  everyone faces one direction  each copying the back of the person ahead. In the online version  everyone must face the screen. “We have to do the opposite of what we’re seeing for the transmission to look right ” the dancer Amanda Kmett’Pendry said. The online version required some new choreography  so to speak. For the transmission to flow in sequence when viewers watch the dancers in a tile arrangement  the dancers have to turn on their cameras in the right order. For a dancer to see only the one person “in front ” each participant has to push a button at the right time. (On Zoom  this involves the “pin” function.) The dancers tried hard to maintain the integrity of the original — they wear as much red as they had with them — but the online version is inevitably different  for participants and viewers. On rooftops  the distance between buildings  or obstructions like ledges  impair perfect mirroring. Online  it can be a briefly frozen signal  a difference in camera angle or maybe a naughty cat. Outside  a viewer can see only a part of the line and has to imagine that the signal started somewhere unseen or continues out of sight. Someone watching online can track the whole sequence  rather like a guard keeping an eye on isolated prisoners via a bank of surveillance cameras. Outside  “you really see the audience ” said Carolyn Lucas  the company’s associate artistic director. “They’re in close proximity  and they connect with the work so closely. But here we are in this place where  my god  there’s no close proximity. Yet there’s a determination to find a vehicle to counteract the distance.” As Ms. Lucas noted  that determination is strongest among the dancers. “Even though the technology scares me a little  there’s this whole crew of younger dancers who are eager to figure out how to adapt.” It’s a situation common to many companies right now. As a steward of Brown’s legacy  Ms. Lucas welcomes the generational shift. The online versions “aren’t the same  but that’s OK ” she said  “The fun of Trisha’s work is that there’s always something to investigate and figure out.” General “Roof Piece” guidelines still apply. “Keep moving even if you’re not sure what you’re seeing ” Ms. Kmett’Pendry advised. Simultaneously receiving and transmitting the message is the idea. “Don’t judge what you’re seeing. Make the best guess and pass that on.” “You don’t have to be too fancy ” Ms. Lucas said. “You should feel really comfortable with the movement that comes out of you.” The Brown dancers are experts  practiced in mimicry  who share a common style of supple yet articulate motion. But even with them  you can see how the same movement changes as it transfers from body to body  mind to mind. “Everybody’s idiosyncratic movement preference is going to be exposed in this  and that’s something people can celebrate ” Ms. Lucas said. In the end  the videoconferencing “Roof Piece” is an exercise in how to communicate with people far away. It’s about how Patrick McGrath in Santa Monica  Calif.  can send a physical message through a digital image to eight fellow dancers who include Stuart Shugg in Australia and Jacob Storer in Richland Center  Wis. It’s about how Cecily Campbell  in Santa Fe  can see Mr. Storer move  and hear the birds near him  and indicate that she’s received Mr. McGrath’s round-the-world message by mimicking it and adding an appreciative smile.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/design/zoya-cherkassky-coronavirus.html, arts design, Lessons From the Plagues  Painted for Passover, The artist Zoya Cherkassky evokes Jewish life in the shtetl in her new virtual exhibition., Supported by The artist Zoya Cherkassky evokes Jewish life in the shtetl in her new virtual exhibition. By Hilarie M. Sheets In quarantine at her home in Tel Aviv last month  the artist Zoya Cherkassky came across a YouTube video of a wedding ceremony held in a Jewish cemetery just outside the city during the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. She learned that such “plague weddings” had evolved in the 19th century across Eastern Europe as a ritual to ward off cholera epidemics. The artist drew “Black Chuppah” in response  a quick work on paper in ink of a sweetly somber bride and groom in black  holding hands under the Jewish wedding canopy erected amid tombstones. Every day since  Ms. Cherkassky has completed another melancholic vignette evoking pre-World War II Jewish life. But the past feels simultaneously contemporary in these intimate paintings on paper. A man carries provisions through a burning shtetl. A family is cloistered together at home in tight quarters. A young girl peers longingly through a curtained window. Now  the gallery Fort Gansevoort is showing her new series virtually  in the online exhibition “Lost Time ” engagingly drawn in a style that evokes both Marc Chagall and Edward Gorey. For instance  “An Open Air Minyan ” darkly humorous  shows 10 religious men gathered in a field to pray — and spaced with the requisite social distancing. “There is no mysticism in my work usually ” Ms. Cherkassky said in a conference call together with the Brooklyn-based curator Alison Gingeras  both isolating in their homes with young children. “I’m not a religious person. But I’ve also never experienced such a situation.” The series is a stark departure for the artist  who was born in Kyiv in 1976 and immigrated to Israel in 1991  just before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Well known in Israel  where she was given a midcareer survey in 2018 at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem  Ms. Cherkassky had her U.S. debut last year in New York at Fort Gansevoort. The vibrantly colored paintings of her Soviet-era childhood  rendered in an appealing combination of social realism and cartooning  were a “knockout ” Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times. The new virtual show reflects the interplay between the artist and curator  who over the last month have been exchanging daily images and writings through text and Zoom. Ms. Cherkassky’s images  drawing on cultural and collective memory  anchor personal and historical ruminations by Ms. Gingeras  who contributed observations about the life of New Yorkers during the crisis. In one exhibition entry  the curator writes: “Zoya’s Jewish family offers us an allegorical portrait of this moment: an imposed ritual of sitting at home  with our thoughts toggling back and forth between memories of things past and anxious projections of an undefined future.” Following are excerpts from the recent conference call with the artist and the curator. Does “Black Chuppah” have an element of hope in its bleakness? ZOYA CHERKASSKY It’s a ritual performed in order to avoid disaster. They hope for something. For me  it was scary to see. Like the epidemic  it does not seem to belong to nowadays. It belongs to old times. You suddenly don’t understand what is happening with time. It gave me a push to do this type of shtetl and Holocaust drawing. ALISON GINGERAS I first saw “Black Chuppah” one morning on Instagram. Somebody had reposted Zoya’s image. The Gothic sensibility of it really stuck in my head. I walk my dog every morning  often past Brooklyn Hospital  and that same morning they first erected a corona tent in front of the hospital. The confluence of these two images struck me. Then I was approached later that day [by the gallery] about this project. Is there a kind of diaristic quality about this project? CHERKASSKY There is  but I think it’s rather about my subconscious. I really like how Alison is combining these imaginary images with her own real-life observations and what is going on in New York. The show opens on Passover and some of the images specifically refer to the holiday. What kind of message do you see in the works? CHERKASSKY In Israel everybody is very busy with Passover now because it’s the biggest holiday. Also  it’s a big fear because everybody is thinking about what will be after Passover. The story of Exodus  another story of danger  is very symbolic for this situation. GINGERAS There’s a lot of reflection about the question of sacrifice that obviously is a thread of this season  between Passover and Easter. Even the kind of pagan practices of the spring season often had to do with symbolic sacrifice. With the frame of all this symbolic celebration  the show does have a kind of heavier tenor. The song “Chad Gadya ” sung at the end of the Passover Seder  seems to be an inspiration for you. CHERKASSKY At least four drawings in the series are related to “Chad Gadya.” In the last two verses  the Angel of Death comes and kills the butcher  and then the God comes and kills the Angel of Death. I illustrated this like a diptych. One side has a skeleton that looks like a Nazi soldier. The second part of it is taken from the victory parade in Red Square [after the defeat of Nazi Germany] where Stalin is the God. GINGERAS That image of Stalin does have a particular resonance right now. We’re seeing authoritarian regimes that are basically extending their abuse of democratic rule of law through this crisis. Even in this country  there’s a lot of anxiety about what’s going to happen with the elections this year. The isolated face peeking out in “Girl at the Window” seems to conflate past and present. CHERKASSKY “Girl at the Window” is like Anne Frank. Of course there is a huge gap between the Holocaust and what is going on now. But everybody  especially in Israel  has grown up with these Holocaust stories. When something terrifying happens  this is immediately what you think about. GINGERAS All the associations in these drawings go beyond the question of Jewish identity. Of course they have a very specific reference point to lost eras and historical traumas. But there is a common humanity that underlies all these images and that takes on a collective resonance for all of us as we experience this kind of Sabbath environment now every day across the world. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/arts/07zoya-passover1/merlin_171190755_505f0a2d-d87d-4345-9e4f-1321bd167096-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/multimedia/author-hilarie-m-sheets/author-hilarie-m-sheets-thumbLarge.png 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/science/coronavirus-uncertainty-scientific-trust.html, science, Embracing the Uncertainties, While the unknowns about coronavirus abound  a new study finds we ‘can handle the truth.’, Supported by While the unknowns about coronavirus abound  a new study finds we ‘can handle the truth.’ By Siobhan Roberts These are  safe to say  uncertain times. The confirmed global cases of illness from coronavirus are approaching 1.5 million  and reported deaths are well into the six figures  but what are the true rates of infection and mortality? We don’t know. Last week  Dr. Robert Redfield  head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said that up to 25 percent of people infected with coronavirus show no symptoms. But at the White House coronavirus task force briefing on Sunday  Dr. Anthony Fauci  head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health  gave a markedly broader range. “It’s somewhere between 25 and 50 percent ” Dr. Fauci said. “And trust me  that is an estimate. I don’t have any scientific data yet. You know when we’ll get the scientific data? When we get those antibody tests out there.” This type of uncertainty about facts  numbers and science is called epistemic uncertainty. It is caused by a lack of knowledge about the past and the present — “our ignorance ” said David Spiegelhalter  a statistician and chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge. Science is full of epistemic uncertainty. Circling the unknowns  inching toward truth through argument and experiment is how progress is made. But science is often expected to be a monolithic collection of all the right answers. As a result  some scientists — and the politicians  policymakers and journalists who depend on them — are reluctant to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties  worried that candor undermines credibility. Then there are scientists like Dr. Fauci  who has also acknowledged uncertainty about matters like the time needed to flatten the curve  to develop an antibody test and to find a vaccine. “I will say what’s true  and whatever happens  happens ” he told Vanity Fair. What happens when scientists do acknowledge uncertainty is the question behind a study  published March 23 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences. It explored “The Effects of Communicating Uncertainty on Public Trust in Facts and Numbers.” “The accusations of a post-truth society  and claims that the public ‘had had enough of experts ’ prompted us to investigate whether trust in ‘experts’ was lowered by their openly admitting uncertainty about what they know ” said Dr. Spiegelhalter  one of the principal investigators. The study’s findings suggest that being transparent about uncertainty does not harm the public’s trust in the facts or in the source. “These results indicate that people ‘can handle the truth’ about the level of certainty or uncertainty of scientific facts and knowledge ” said Anne Marthe van der Bles  a psychologist at the University of Groningen  who is the lead author and an affiliate with the Cambridge research team. Using online surveys  the study measured reactions to uncertainty expressed in statements about various subjects: the number of tigers left in India  the increase in global average surface temperature between 1880 and 2010 and unemployment figures in the United Kingdom. The survey was replicated “in the wild” with a field study on the BBC News website. The researchers tested uncertainties presented quantitatively  with a numerical range or percentage; and more qualitatively  using a word such as “estimated” or “approximately.” The precise numerical statements were more effective both in conveying uncertainty and in maintaining trust. (There was in fact a minor reduction in trust  but the researchers deemed the effect so small as to be trivial.) “I find it heartening  and very good advice ” said Ed Humpherson  the director general of the Office for Statistics Regulation in the U.K. “Being trustworthy depends not on conveying an aura of infallibility  but on honesty and transparency.” Starting on March 19  the experiment was replicated in several countries with statements about the severity of Covid-19  the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Early results confirm the paper’s findings. “So  where there is uncertainty around — for example  the death rates from Covid-19 — people shouldn’t feel concerned about communicating this to the public ” said Alex Freeman  a co-author  and the executive director of the Winton Centre. “It may be important to do so.” The public  in turn  must be open to considering and adapting to new evidence  said Lorraine Daston  a historian of science at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. “We the public must expect scientific views on the nature of the virus and how best to combat it to change as more evidence comes in  and be prepared to change our conduct accordingly ” she said. The Cambridge team has been exploring uncertainty in its many forms for a while now. Last year  they published a theory paper  reviewing related research. At a conference of uncertainty quantification specialists about two years ago  Dr. Freeman asked attendees to write definitions of uncertainty on Post-it notes and stick them on the wall. “Every one was different ” she said. “I have to say my favorite was: ‘Anything and everything that can **** up a decision’ [insert descriptor of your choice].” The recent study  funded by the Nuffield Foundation  focused on people’s reactions to epistemic uncertainty: things we don’t know about the past and present but in theory could come to know  through measurement. The team is now researching perceptions of aleatory uncertainty — unknowns about the future due to randomness  indeterminacy  chance or luck. (In Latin  alea means dice or gambling.) Most uncertainty is a mix of epistemic and aleatory elements. For instance: How many more people will get Covid-19? And once transmission is suppressed below the R0=1 threshold (the reproduction number required to rapidly reduce the number of cases to low levels)  how will we avoid a rebound? Common wisdom from the psychologist’s perspective is that people do not like uncertainty  especially about the future  and that it generates a negative response. (Psychologists call this “ambiguity aversion.”) From the statistician’s perspective  the hypothesis is that people have a positive reaction and trust information more when the communicator is being open about uncertainties in facts and figures. “The motivation was to try to adjudicate between these competing hypotheses ” said Sander van der Linden  a principal investigator  and a psychologist and the director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab. “Ultimately we didn’t find support for the notion that communicating uncertainty enhances public trust  but it also didn’t substantially undermine it.” Either way  there is little to assuage our most pressing existential uncertainty: When will the pandemic end? In the early days of the outbreak  when data was beginning to emerge from China  we were in a state of “deep uncertainty ” also known as “radical uncertainty” or “Knightian uncertainty.” (The economist Frank Knight distinguished between risk and uncertainty about a century ago.) Deep uncertainty is the quagmire of unknown unknowns; there are no constraints. Risk is yet another type of uncertainty  usually pertaining to things in the future that might turn out badly. Risk encompasses the known unknowns and can be calculated with probabilities. As more reliable data comes in  said Dr. Spiegelhalter  “the Covid-19 pandemic is rapidly becoming a constrained problem.” Earlier in March  he sought to tame the uncertainty and the fear by investigating exactly how much “normal risk” infection with coronavirus represents. We face normal risk daily — “We are all going to die sometime ” said Dr. Spiegelhalter. And the odds increase from one day to the next  with age. Working with the latest (albeit uncertain) data about Covid-19 mortality rates  he found that getting infected essentially compressed a year’s worth of normal risk into a couple of weeks. His risk of dying in the next year  as a 66-year-old man  was about 1.5 percent. “Very roughly  getting Covid-19 seems to be like packing that much risk into the time that you are ill ” he said. “Of course  if you survive  you still have your standard ration of risk to deal with.” Statistical science  he said  “is a machine  in a sense  to turn the variability that we see in the world — the unpredictability  the enormous amount of scatter and randomness that we see around us — into a tool that can quantify our uncertainty about facts and numbers and science.” But as he acknowledged in his book  “The Art of Statistics ” models “are simplifications of the real world — they are the maps not the territory.” (This is reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges’s story  “On Exactitude in Science ” about a map growing as large as the territory it was meant to represent.) The limitations and uncertainties inevitably get exploited in politicized narratives  and entangled in misinformation and disinformation  making it all the more important to confront them head on. Neil Ferguson  who heads the team of epidemiologists at Imperial College London that produced the influential March 16 report modeling the virus’s spread  said that it is the role of modelers  in presenting the projections  to at once indicate the uncertainties “and to evaluate effectively how the uncertainties — the extent of asymptomatic infection  for instance; the overall lethality of this virus — might change the conclusions  particularly qualitatively rather than quantitatively.” In communicating uncertain or ambiguous results for governments  Dr. Ferguson usually includes “confidence bounds” or “error bars.” But in doing a radio interview  for instance  he tends to opt for more qualitative descriptions. He was surprised to hear that the study’s results indicated that quantitative statements are more effective in conveying uncertainty even with a more general audience. “Maybe I’ll take that on board ” he said. The study is  in a sense  proof of the value in acknowledging these unknowns. As Dr. Spiegelhalter noted  it is “an empirical test of humility.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/europe/boris-johnson-coronavirus.html, world europe, With Boris Johnson in Intensive Care  U.K. Faces a Leadership Quandary, Lacking a written constitution  Britain has no codified order of succession for prime minister. For now  the foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  will take the reins., Supported by Lacking a written constitution  Britain has no codified order of succession for prime minister. For now  the foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  will take the reins. By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle LONDON — The British government hurtled into uncharted territory on Tuesday  with its foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  taking up the day-to-day duties of Prime Minister Boris Johnson  who was being treated in an intensive care unit as he battled a worsening case of the coronavirus. Britain  with no written constitution  does not have a codified order of succession. That legal lacuna has prompted questions during prior episodes where prime ministers fell ill or underwent surgery  and now looms large at a time when Britain faces its greatest crisis since World War II. Mr. Raab  46  as first secretary of state  would become the government’s de facto leader if the prime minister could not carry out his duties. He was “deputized” by Mr. Johnson on Monday  led the government’s daily meetings about the pandemic and will probably take on additional duties  with Mr. Johnson’s prognosis so uncertain. The government said Mr. Johnson  who has suffered symptoms of the virus for 11 days  was moved into intensive care after his condition deteriorated sharply. He has received “standard oxygen treatment” but is breathing on his own and has not been put on a ventilator. Nor has pneumonia been diagnosed.  “I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister  he’s a fighter ” Mr. Raab said at a news conference. Still  how the government will function if the prime minister is out for a prolonged period  or dies  is not yet clear. “If he is incapacitated for quite a long time  then you’re in totally different circumstances ” said Jonathan Powell  who was chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. “In the middle of a crisis like this  in the modern world  it is quite impossible to function without a prime minister.” The government will face momentous decisions  including when and how to lift the lockdown on Britain. Mr. Johnson  55  had been leading that process and communicated the government’s measures to the public in daily briefings  where his familiar shambling style gave way to a graver mien. Mr. Raab  by contrast  has been a peripheral figure in the government’s response  mostly focusing on organizing evacuation flights to bring back Britons stranded overseas. He is best known for his hard-line views on Brexit  which helped him get his post in Mr. Johnson’s pro-Brexit cabinet. Mr. Raab  officials said  was working from his quarters in the Foreign Office. He would chair meetings on national security  though in the case of an emergency  the cabinet would make decisions on a collective basis. While he is trusted by the prime minister  Mr. Raab is only one of several ambitious ministers who may assert their right to step up. Michael Gove  a senior cabinet minister and longtime rival of Mr. Johnson  was the face of the government on television Tuesday morning  though he announced that he  too  was now in isolation at home after a family member showed mild coronavirus symptoms. Other ministers — like the chancellor of the Exchequer  Rishi Sunak  and the health secretary  Matt Hancock — have been leading key parts of the response and will have strong voices. Keeping discipline could be difficult  analysts said  with much of the responsibility for that falling to the cabinet secretary  Mark Sedwill. If Mr. Raab were to become incapacitated  officials said  Mr. Sunak would be next in line as de facto leader. As chancellor  he has gotten good reviews for rolling out gargantuan packages to rescue an economy under lockdown. In one sense  Mr. Raab’s less direct involvement could be an advantage  allowing him to resolve potential disputes between economic and health officials over the easing of social distancing measures. On Tuesday  Mr. Raab signaled the government was not close to a decision on lifting the lockdown. “The cabinet has to demonstrate unity of purpose  with no squabbling or briefing against each other  and to put the national interest first ” said David Lidington  a former deputy to Mr. Johnson’s predecessor  Theresa May. The son of a Czech refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938  Mr. Raab is not known for his diplomatic skills. He served as Brexit secretary under Mrs. May  but quit her government after clashes over her negotiations with the European Union. In 2012  he was a contributor to “Britannia Unchained ” a book that laid out a vision of a free-market  deregulatory future for a post-Brexit Britain. He mounted an unsuccessful run for party leader last summer. If Mr. Johnson died or were permanently sidelined  said Mujtaba Rahman  an analyst at Eurasia Group  the cabinet would probably agree on a caretaker prime minister — probably Mr. Raab — and schedule a vote for the Conservative Party to choose a new leader. But holding a vote would be difficult until the worst of the pandemic passed  and a full-blown campaign  like the one that ended in Mr. Johnson’s election as party leader last July  seems out of the question for now. Mr. Johnson is only one of several prominent officials to be struck by the virus. Mr. Hancock  the heath secretary  had symptoms and emerged from self-isolation late last week. The chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  made his first public appearance on Monday after a week of self-quarantine. Mr. Johnson’s most influential adviser  Dominic Cummings  was filmed hurrying out of Downing Street the day after his boss tested positive for the virus. He has not been seen in public since. No other Western government has been so ravaged by the virus  and it comes after three and a half years of political upheaval. Even before this crisis  analysts said Mr. Johnson’s cabinet was weak  in part because he purged several senior party members during last fall’s bitter debate over Brexit. Downing Street has released few details about Mr. Johnson’s condition. On Monday  Mr. Raab told reporters that the prime minister had spent a comfortable night and was in good spirits. But he said he had not spoken to Mr. Johnson since Saturday. Two hours after that soothing prognosis  Mr. Johnson was being moved into intensive care. [Analysis: Peaks  testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion.] On Tuesday  Mr. Gove acknowledged that he had not spoken to Mr. Johnson either. No doctor has briefed the press about the prime minister’s condition. British governments have typically tried to hush up cases where prime ministers had health problems. In 1953  Winston Churchill suffered a serious stroke and was spirited to his country house  Chartwell  where he recuperated in secrecy with a nurse and his private secretary bringing him government papers. For weeks  his secretary  Jock Colville  later wrote  “My colleagues and I had to handle requests for decisions from ministers and government departments who were entirely ignorant of the prime minister’s incapacity.” In 1983  Margaret Thatcher had an eye operation for a detached retina at a private clinic in Windsor. The government did not disclose her location  but the press discovered it and the surgeon later spoke to reporters. In 2003 and 2004  Mr. Blair underwent two heart procedures for cardiac arrhythmia  at least one of which required sedation. In both cases  Mr. Powell recalled  “We kept it hush-hush and didn’t brief it beforehand.” But Mr. Blair was back on the job within 24 hours and suffered no lingering effects. Part of the problem  Mr. Powell said  is that the role of prime minister has evolved from being first among equals in an empowered cabinet to more of a singular national leader  in the mold of an American or French president. “We don’t have a cabinet system in the old way ” Mr. Powell said. “Since Thatcher  the prime minister has been more of a president. We need a prime minister in place to make the key decisions.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/world/07VIRUS-BRITAIN1/merlin_171356220_4e914a20-8f03-4863-bbea-13a06b1cc251-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v3.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-stephen-castle/author-stephen-castle-thumbLarge.png

It Got an Army., More than 750 000 people are pitching in to help older and more vulnerable Britons  helping dispel the discord of the Brexit era., Supported by More than 750 000 people are pitching in to help older and more vulnerable Britons  helping dispel the discord of the Brexit era. By Mark Landler LONDON — A few weeks ago  Kate Sellars was organizing a James Bond getaway for her wealthy clients  in which they would have been flown by helicopter to Monte Carlo for a preview of the latest Bond movie  a glittering party with cast members and  for each guest  an Aston Martin gassed up and ready to drive. Last week  Ms. Sellars lugged three bags of groceries from her local supermarket to the front step of Garth D’lima  a 73-year-old retired accountant who is marooned inside his house as the coronavirus sweeps London. “It’s just heartbreaking not to be able to help him carry his groceries up the stairs ” she said  as she waved at Mr. D’lima from his front gate. “We can’t go into people’s houses because that would put them at risk.” Ms. Sellars  whose luxury travel agency has been put on ice by the pandemic  has traded her glamorous day job for a grinding schedule of grocery shopping and picking up prescriptions for older people in Hampstead  her leafy  prosperous London neighborhood. She is a foot soldier in a vast volunteer army  marshaled in barely a week  to take care of Britain’s most vulnerable people during the country’s lockdown. When the government appealed recently for 250 000 people to help the National Health Service  more than 750 000 signed up. It was forced to temporarily stop taking applicants so it could process the flood. In addition to the national program  hundreds of community-based aid groups have sprung up around the country  enrolling tens of thousands of volunteers  like Ms. Sellars. All told  it is a stirring display of British national solidarity — a good-news story amid a grim tide of bulletins about overwhelmed hospitals  inadequate testing  a rising death toll  and a depleted political establishment  with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in intensive care and several of his aides still struggling after contracting the virus. [Analysis: Coronavirus puts to the fore an improbable U.K. leader: Dominic Raab.] It is also a welcome balm  coming after three and a half years of bitter divisions over Brexit  a debate that cleaved the country socially  culturally and generationally. Coronavirus  many commentators have noted  is an equal-opportunity scourge: It strikes both “Leavers” and “Remainers.” “During the Brexit debate  people used to say what we really need is a common enemy — and now we’ve got it ” said David Goodhart  a writer whose last book  “The Road to Somewhere ” explored the divide in British society between the rooted and the rootless. “Except this is an invisible enemy.” The lockdown  Mr. Goodhart said  has exposed the “hidden indoor plumbing” of an affluent society: garbage collectors  delivery people  drugstore clerks and grocery store workers who keep food on the shelves. “It turns out that shelf stackers in supermarkets are absolutely vital ” he said. Most poignantly  it has exposed the plight of seniors  who run by far the highest risk of succumbing to the pathogen. With that in mind  the government has urged people over the age of 70 to cut off all but the most necessary social contact for 12 weeks to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. That deprives even the able-bodied of daily walks to their local shops. Confined to their houses  many have no idea how they are supposed to get food or other supplies. Lacking broadband connections  some have no face-to-face contact with friends or family members. “The government has told 1.5 million people to stay inside  without any idea of who they are or how they’re supposed to do that ” said Connor Rochford  a medical doctor and former management consultant who started Hampstead Volunteer Corps with his partner  Sarah Dobbie  and another couple  Kate and Brendan Guy. “They feel scared and they feel isolated ” he said. “Self-reliance is fine up to a point  but the ‘Keep Calm  Carry On’ ethic only goes so far.” Since starting up on March 14  a week before Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed the national lockdown  his group has amassed more than 600 volunteers. They are assigned to team leaders  like Ms. Sellars  who oversee areas of a few square blocks and parcel out the deliveries. So far  the group has helped 166 people  some with one-time requests  others with standing orders. With little guidance from the government  the group has been forced to devise its own safety protocols. Volunteers wear face masks and sterilized gloves and keep a strict distance from the people they are helping. They are not allowed to enter their houses. The organizers have consulted crisis counselors for advice in dealing with people in particularly dire circumstances. Money is a tricky issue: Some people are able to call ahead to stores and give their credit card information. In other cases  the volunteers front the expenses for groceries and get reimbursed when they drop them off. For pensioners like Mr. D’lima  who pride themselves on their independence  it is not an easy adjustment. A few days earlier  he had lined up outside his overcrowded supermarket during a hailstorm. “I live alone so I always do my own shopping ” he said. “But my friend told me I shouldn’t go out.” Some still refuse the helping hand. On her way to dropping off a prescription  Ms. Sellars stopped a quite elderly man in a raincoat on Hampstead’s High Street. He told her he was going to the post office  not realizing it was closed. When she offered to help him with his shopping  he stared at her incredulously. “If you want to help me ” he snapped  “you can give me £1 000.” As the man turned away  Ms. Sellars  who is 39  smiled sadly and said  “we call those people the Blitz generation.” The heroism of the Blitz is much invoked these days. For some  the spirit of 1940 and 1941  when Britain was pounded nightly by German bombers  is evident in the stubborn self-reliance of people like the old man  determined to press on  however trying the circumstances. For others  it is apparent in the broader drama of Britons summoning the resilience that saw their parents and grandparents through that ordeal. At 8 p.m. each Thursday  people gather in windows or on doorsteps to clap for the doctors and nurses of the National Health Service. The polite applause of the first week has given way to a clamorous din  as people bang pots and pans. The Blitz  some point out  had its less heroic dimensions. “It was not all Churchillian sticking together  but full of unpleasantness and crime ” said Simon Jenkins  author of “A Short History of London.” Still  he said  “myth is as important as reality.” Drawing a link to wartime Britain  Mr. Jenkins said  has been a valuable way for the government to try to shore up morale in this difficult period. For some older people  the volunteer army is a throwback to a past they remember as more socially cohesive than today. “It reminds me of my childhood in the Fifties ” said Jenni Towler  69  who came to her door to pick up pain medication delivered by Ms. Sellars. “There was more interaction. We played together in the streets.” “We’re all hunkered down and not allowed to be with each other ” she said. “But we don’t feel alone. I hope this will last and we will be more neighborly — not just send each other texts or emojis on our phones.” For Ms. Sellars  volunteering has given meaning to a life unmoored by the pandemic. Her travel business  she is confident  will come back. But in the meantime  she said she had made friendships with people who otherwise would have been strangers on the sidewalk. Some leave her small gifts at the door. Getting to know them has given her a new perspective on the neighborhood where she was born. “The big question is  what happens when this is over?” Ms. Sellars asked as she paused to gaze over the Victorian rooftops of Hampstead. Then her cellphone rang  and she scribbled down an order to deliver a packet of soap to another urban castaway of the coronavirus.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/americas/ecuador-correa-corruption-verdict.html, world americas, Ecuador’s Former President Convicted on Corruption Charges, The outcome of Rafael Correa’s closely watched trial is likely to affect Ecuador’s political landscape for years to come., Supported by The outcome of Rafael Correa’s closely watched trial is likely to affect Ecuador’s political landscape for years to come. By José María León Cabrera QUITO  Ecuador — A top court in Ecuador on Tuesday convicted Rafael Correa  the country’s former president  on corruption charges and sentenced him to eight years in prison  a blow to a charismatic yet divisive leader and his hopes to lead the nation again. Mr. Correa  a socialist  was Ecuador’s president from 2007 to 2017  a time when left-wing leaders were ascendant in Latin America  including Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez  Bolivia’s Evo Morales and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. That left-wing wave has since subsided. The decision comes as Ecuador faces its most pressing public health crisis in recent memory  one of the worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus in Latin America. The epidemic is straining the country’s political systems as well as its medical resources  as people clamor for help. In the city of Guayaquil  so many people have died that bodies are waiting in the streets for hours for collection. Mr. Correa was among 20 people  including his vice president  Jorge Glas  accused of accepting $8 million in bribes in exchange for public contracts from 2012 and 2016. The former president left Ecuador three years ago  and his conviction  which he can appeal  leaves him subject to arrest if he returns. In addition to the prison term  the court banned Mr. Correa  57  from politics for 25 years. The trial was closely watched in Ecuador and the verdict is likely to affect not only a presidential election slated for next year  but also the political landscape for years to come. Mr. Correa denied the charges  describing them as a form of political persecution intended to prevent him and his allies from running in future national elections. After leaving office in 2017  he moved to Belgium and vowed to retire from politics  but he has since reversed course. Saying that he felt compelled to “take the fatherland back ” Mr. Correa has expressed interest in running for office in 2021  which his conviction  if it stands  would prevent. “Correa is  paradoxically  the most popular and the most rejected political figure in Ecuador ” the political analyst Rafael Balda said. His presence on the ballot would lift his political party  now known as Movimiento Revolución Ciudadana  but even his campaigning on its behalf would make a big difference  Mr. Balda said. The case emerged from an investigation initially known as Arroz Verde  or Green Rice  after the name of the file found in an email sent to a former aide to Mr. Correa. The file  revealed by the online publication Mil Hojas  contained names  amounts and dates of payments made by several companies and individuals to the campaigns of his party  prosecutors said. During the trial  the prosecution accused Mr. Correa of creating a multitiered “criminal structure” that collected payoffs without its leaders having to ask for them directly. Attorney General Diana Salazar  who prosecuted the case  asked the judges to impose the maximum eight-year sentence. She likened Mr. Correa’s tactics to those of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar  who did not deliver cocaine personally  but set up a network designed to smuggle drugs. Mr. Correa’s lawyers presented his formal defense in court. But the former president has been famously vocal and argumentative on social media since long before the practice was popular among some political leaders  and he offered his own commentary on the trial as it went on. Minutes before the verdict was announced on Tuesday  he wrote on Twitter that his political foes  including the current president  Lenín Moreno  “conduct the worst and fiercest political persecution in the region.” An outsider who rose to power after a brief stint as economics minister  Mr. Correa brought together a coalition of workers  environmentalists  young people and left-leaning organizations to back his first presidential bid. Economic inequality declined during Mr. Correa’s tenure  but Ecuador grew polarized. His charisma and heavy investment in infrastructure lifted his popularity  but he was also accused of abuse of power and suppression of the press. During the first half of Mr. Correa’s tenure  Ecuador experienced an economic boom  which he credited to his government policies  but his critics say was more the product of oil price increases. When prices fell  the economy foundered. Mr. Correa was succeeded by Mr. Moreno  his vice president from 2007 to 2013. A few weeks after Mr. Moreno was inaugurated  their relationship soured. The breaking point was the indictment  arrest and conviction of Mr. Glas  a Correa loyalist who also served as vice president for Mr. Moreno  on corruption charges.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-pandemic-primary-republicans.html, us politics, Why Wisconsin Republicans Insisted on an Election in a Pandemic, Mask-wearing voters in endless lines. Five polling places instead of 180. Voting amid the coronavirus crisis is full of challenges — and connected to G.O.P. efforts to limit who gets a ballot in the state., Supported by Mask-wearing voters in endless lines. Five polling places instead of 180. Voting amid the coronavirus crisis is full of challenges — and connected to G.O.P. efforts to limit who gets a ballot in the state. By Reid J. Epstein Tuesday’s mess of an election in Wisconsin is the culmination of a decade of efforts by state Republicans to make voting harder  redraw legislative boundaries and dilute the power of voters in the state’s urban centers. The Republican-dominated state legislature  which has held a majority since 2011  due in part to gerrymandered maps  refused to entertain the Democratic governor’s request to mail absentee ballots to all voters or move the primary. Then the State Supreme Court  which is controlled by conservative justices  overturned the governor’s ruling to postpone the election until June. Now Wisconsin is conducting an election that the state’s largest newspaper — which previously endorsed Republican leaders including former Gov. Scott Walker — called “the most undemocratic in the state’s history.” Here’s a look at how it came to this point. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin  but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice  Daniel Kelly  and a liberal challenger  Jill Karofsky. The winner will be in position to cast a deciding vote on a case before the court that seeks to purge more than 200 000 people from Wisconsin’s voter rolls — in a state where 2.6 million people voted in the last governor’s race. When the matter was first before the court in January  Mr. Kelly recused himself  citing his upcoming election. He indicated he would “rethink” his position following the April election  which comes with a 10-year term. But the election proceeding on Tuesday is not just about the voter purge case. It is the latest example of what many in the state see as a decade-long effort by Wisconsin Republicans to dilute the voting power of the state’s Democratic and African-American voters. Since 2011  when Mr. Walker led a Republican takeover of the state government  the G.O.P. has enacted one of the nation’s strictest laws requiring government-issued identification to vote. In 2020  a voter must have a photo ID with a current address  or an ID and acceptable proof of residency — often a hardship for poorer black Milwaukee residents who live in neighborhoods with some of the highest eviction rates in the country. A 2017 study by the University of Wisconsin found nearly 17 000 registered voters were unable to cast a ballot during the 2016 election  and untold more were deterred from voting. The Republican majority also drew legislative and congressional boundaries that are widely considered the most gerrymandered in the country. During the 2018 election  Democratic candidates won 190 000 more votes for State Assembly seats  but the G.O.P. held a 64-35 advantage in the chamber. Forty Republican lawmakers on Monday wrote to Gov. Tony Evers  a Democrat  asking him to reopen the state’s golf courses. If Mr. Kelly wins  it would cement the conservative majority’s ability to block any future Democratic efforts to change voting laws and litigate an expected stalemate over congressional and state legislative boundaries during redistricting that will follow the 2020 census. Wisconsin is  by many projections  a key state for clinching an Electoral College victory. And in the last four years it has seen some of the closest statewide races in the country. In 2016  President Trump won the state by less than 23 000 votes. In 2018  Mr. Evers ousted Mr. Walker by less than 30 000 votes. In 2019  a State Supreme Court race was decided by just 6 000 votes. In a state so closely divided  any adjustment to voting procedures or voter eligibility has the potential to swing enough votes to tip the state. This is truly a mystery that has consumed Democrats both inside and outside Wisconsin. For weeks Mr. Evers insisted he didn’t have the power to change the election date without consent of the state legislature  which consistently refused to entertain the idea. Instead he sought other remedies  such as sending absentee ballots to all voters and extending the time for voters to return ballots by mail — ideas that Republicans resisted and that were eventually struck down in courts dominated by Republican appointees. Mr. Evers  a bland former state education secretary who won in 2018 on the backs of liberal anger and disgust with Mr. Walker  spent the run-up to the election “grandstanding with impossible demands ” said John Langeland  the Democratic Party chairman of Oneida County  in Wisconsin’s Northwoods. “He had to know that there was no way to print  distribute and tally enough ballots for an absentee-only election.” But Mr. Evers wasn’t helped by disunity among leaders and national figures in his own party. While Mr. Sanders last week called for postponing the state’s election  Mr. Biden predicted the contest could be held safely. In Wisconsin  the pandemic is hitting hardest in Milwaukee’s black neighborhoods  which are home to a critical Democratic voting bloc. Of the 83 coronavirus deaths in the state  33 have been black residents of Milwaukee — 40 percent of the total in a state that is 7 percent black. Democrats had hoped postponing the contest to June and changing it to an all-mail election would alleviate fears of the pandemic and allow people to vote safely. With the state so divided  any tangible drop-off in urban turnout is likely to tip the State Supreme Court race to Mr. Kelly. Public health officials across the state have closed hundreds of precincts because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Milwaukee  just five of 180 planned polling places are open  leading to hourslong lines of masked and socially distanced voters. This comes as Milwaukee voters — an electorate that includes nearly all of the state’s black population — have lagged well behind suburban counterparts in returning absentee ballots. During the 2018 election  the number of votes from Waukesha County made up about 57 percent of the total number of votes from adjacent Milwaukee County. Two-thirds of Milwaukee County voters backed Mr. Evers  the Democrat  while two-thirds of Waukesha County voters picked Mr. Walker  the Republican. Absentee ballot data from the Wisconsin Election Commission shows that  as of Tuesday morning  Waukesha County voters have returned 78 percent as many absentee ballots as have Milwaukee County voters — a drastic narrowing of the voting gap between the two counties. The data also shows that absentee turnout is far higher in the state’s major metropolitan areas than it is in the rural counties. Statewide  864 750 people had returned absentee ballots by Tuesday morning  according to the elections commission. But that data shows voters in urban centers were returning ballots at a far higher clip than rural Wisconsinites. Seven counties have returned absentee ballots that account for more than 80 percent of the total turnout from the 2019 spring election  which also featured a State Supreme Court race but no presidential primary. Five of the seven are in greater Milwaukee  and the other two include Madison and La Crosse  both college towns. Some predominantly rural counties saw comparatively few absentee ballots returned. Clark County  in the state’s north  and Menominee County  whose population is largely Native American  had an absentee ballot return rate of just 17 percent of their 2019 turnout. Bruce Johnson  the Democratic chairman in Pepin County  along the state’s western border with Minnesota  said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.

As a teenager  Sergio Rossi and his brother  the sons of a bespoke shoemaker  would travel up and down the Italian Riviera selling shoes in the years after World War II  as the country was rebuilding. Mr. Rossi fully joined the family business in the 1950s and by 1968 had introduced a namesake line  becoming one of the first major figures in the Italian footwear industry Mr. Rossi died on Thursday in Cesena  Italy at 84. The cause was the coronavirus  a spokeswoman for the company that carries his name said. Mr. Rossi was part of the generation of Italian artisans who emerged after World War II determined to take the country’s expertise in leatherwork and accessories from local family businesses to the world. He was known for his perfectly balanced  albeit often spindly  heels as well as styles like the Opanca sandal  with a sole that curved up the sides to blend in with the foot  and his signature Godiva stiletto  The Times is telling the stories of those who have died in the pandemic. Suggest a family member or friend below. He was also among the first footwear specialists to lend his talents to ready-to-wear designers  collaborating with names like Versace and Dolce & Gabbana to create the footwear for their collections. Each Sergio Rossi shoe was famous for requiring 120 steps and 14 hours to make. In a video post on Facebook on Friday  Mayor Luciana Garbuglia of San Mauro Pascoli  an Italian shoemaking center near Cesena on the Adriatic coast  where Mr. Rossi was born and lived  noted that Mr. Rossi had opened a production facility in the town in 1951 that has became a major source of jobs. Mr. Rossi was born in 1935 and learned his trade from his father. As a major designer  he reached global prominence in the 1970s in part through his work with the upstart designer Gianni Versace. The way Mr. Rossi’s sensuous heels complemented Mr. Versace’s clothes elevated shoes to an integral part of a look  as opposed to an afterthought. Mr. Rossi  who opened his first store in San Mauro in 1980  also worked with Dolce & Gabbana and Azzedine Alaïa in the 1980s and ’90s. Over the next two decades he continued to expand in Europe and America  and his son  Gianvito  came to work at his side. In 1999  during the flurry of consolidation among fashion brands that laid the groundwork for the modern luxury industry  Gucci Group (later Kering) bought the Sergio Rossi brand for approximately $96.2 million; Mr. Rossi remained as chairman and design director  though both he and his son later left the business. His son now has his own line under his name. Kering sold the Rossi brand in 2015 to the private equity company Investindustrial  which relaunched Sergio Rossi the following year. “He loved women and was able to capture a woman’s femininity in a unique way  creating the perfect extension of a woman’s leg through his shoes ” Riccardo Sciutto  the shoe company’s chief executive  said of Mr. Rossi in an Instagram post. The company has preserved his legacy with an archive of sketches and documents in their San Mauro facility  along with shoes  lasts and other accessories. Thus far  it has 6 000 items.

Mr. Petrocelli had the novel coronavirus., Supported by Those We’ve Lost He and a firefighter son answered the call when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center; another son died there. Mr. Petrocelli had the novel coronavirus. By Dan Barry This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. In recent years  Albert Petrocelli was known in Staten Island’s Huguenot section as that nice man with the rosary beads and the bountiful garden. He walked the local streets  rosary in hand  offering to say prayers for those who could use them: a neighbor  a crossing guard  anyone. But Mr. Petrocelli  who died at 73 of the novel coronavirus on April 1  was more than a retiree with beads and time on his hands. He served in Vietnam. He served as a New York Fire Department battalion chief. He lost a son in the World Trade Center attacks. Most of all  his wife  Ginger Petrocelli  said  “He was a good guy.” Mr. Petrocelli was born on Feb. 21  1947  to Peter Petrocelli  a postal worker  and Mary (Capece) Petrocelli  who ran the household. The family lived first on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and then in Bay Ridge  Brooklyn  where he attended William E. Grady High School and planned on becoming an electrician. When he was still in high school  Albert met an Irish-American girl  Ginger Walsh  at a sweet shop in Bay Ridge  and they began to date. After high school  and with the Army about to send him overseas  they married in a hurry — on March 18  1967  the day between the Irish-centric St. Patrick’s Day and the Italian-centric St. Joseph’s Day. Mr. Petrocelli came home from the war a year later  and before long the couple had two boys. He enjoyed a long career with the Fire Department  retiring as a battalion chief in Brooklyn. The sons — Albert Jr.  a firefighter  and Mark  a commodities broker — both married and settled in Staten Island. “Everything was like …  ” Mr. Petrocelli once said  and Mrs. Petrocelli finished the thought: “The way it should be.” On Sept. 11  2001  Mark was on the 92nd floor of the north tower when the first plane hit. His father and older brother rushed to Lower Manhattan  determined to find him. But his father’s can-do attitude  forged by war and fire  could not overcome what they found  and could not find. Mark Petrocelli was 28. Things were not as they should have been  but the Petrocellis endured. They set up a memorial in their yard. They doted on their two granddaughters  Emily and Lily. They celebrated their 50th anniversary in style. They also managed to have a brief moment with Pope Francis during the pontiff’s New York visit in 2015. While attending a ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum  Mr. Petrocelli held out his firefighter’s hat  which contained some rosaries and prayer cards  and asked the pope to bless them in Mark’s memory. “The pope smiled and blessed everything he had ” Mrs. Petrocelli recalled. Mr. Petrocelli walked nearly every morning to 7:30 Mass at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School. He walked everywhere  in fact  holding his rosary beads of green Connemara marble — that is  when he wasn’t nurturing his garden’s fruits and vegetables  which he would often give away. Sometimes he gave away the entire plant. He began to feel uncharacteristically fatigued in mid-March  declined over the next two weeks  and died at Staten Island Hospital’s south campus. In addition to his wife and son  Mr. Petrocelli is survived by two granddaughters. “When Mark was killed  I was devastated ” Mrs. Petrocelli said  voice breaking. “But I had Albie. We did it together.” A week after his death  his wife was continuing to receive messages from the many people her husband had touched. I have his strawberry plants  they say. I have his fig trees.

She died of the novel coronavirus., Supported by Those We’ve lost A longtime Hermès window dresser  she created fantastical worlds that held the gaze of passers-by. She died of the novel coronavirus. By Vanessa Friedman This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. For more than a half-century Leïla Menchari transformed the windows of the Hermès flagship store in Paris into exotic worlds that allowed any passer-by  even for just a minute  free access to the fantasies of a luxury brand. She built enormous winged feet and spinning meteorites and embedded a sparkling Pegasus within a jeweled geode. She brought in artists to lend their visions to the displays. In the process she elevated the store window into an art form unto itself. Her windows at 42 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  the store’s address  became so famous that the Grand Palais in Paris in 2017 held an exhibit devoted to her work  “Hermès Takes Flight: The Worlds of Leïla Menchari.” “Hermès wouldn’t be Hermès without Leïla ” Axel Dumas  the chief executive of the luxury house  said at the opening of the exhibit. The filmmaker Josée Dayan made a documentary about her  and the French novelist Michel Tournier christened her “The Queen of Enchantment.” Ms. Menchari died in Paris on Saturday She was 93. The cause was the novel coronavirus  her friend Carla Sozzani said. “She taught us to look at the world through the prism of color ” Pierre-Alexis Dumas  the artistic director of Hermès and a cousin of Axel  said. “She was a storyteller without equal.” Ms. Menchari was born in September 1927 in Tunis to a family of wealthy landowners; her father was a lawyer  and her mother a court clerk and women’s rights activist. Ms. Menchari was the first woman admitted to the Beaux-Arts institute in Tunis. She also studied at the Beaux-Arts school in Paris  where she created theater sets that became a template for her windows. She briefly modeled for the designer Guy Laroche before joining the decoration team at Hermès in 1961. She was appointed director of window displays and  in 1978  of the silk colors committee  which determines the palette for each season of the brand’s scarves. She was also instrumental in bringing such Tunisian fashion talents as the designer Azzedine Alaïa to France. She retired in 2013. “When designing a scene  there must always be some mystery  because mystery is a springboard to dreams ” Ms. Menchari told Vogue Arabia in an interview in 2017. “Mystery is an invitation to fill in the gaps left by the imagination.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/digital-privacy-coronavirus.html, opinion, Privacy Cannot Be a Casualty of the Coronavirus, Many Americans now rely on digital tools to work remotely and stay connected. They shouldn’t have to sacrifice their privacy to use them., Supported by Many Americans now rely on digital tools to work remotely and stay connected. They shouldn’t have to sacrifice their privacy to use them. By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. Millions of Americans  sheltering in their homes from the coronavirus  have turned to communications platforms like Zoom  Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger in order to work or stay connected to friends and family. Free and easy to use  the services are gobbling up record numbers of new users. But there’s a saying in Silicon Valley: If the product is free  you are the product. This is not business as usual  though. Americans aren’t willingly surrendering their online identities during this pandemic — many are being compelled to do so by their schools  family or work. Just as a swath of manufacturers are switching their production lines to ventilator and mask production for the greater good  corporations that normally view every new registered user as a data point to exploit need to take a pause on profiting from online data harvesting. For those fortunate enough to have laptops and reliable broadband internet at home  it is not sufficient to simply update privacy policies or customer agreements. Americans need a guarantee that conversations held over video chat won’t be data collection events. The videoconferencing company Zoom has been a standout brand of the pandemic  in part because its daily user numbers ballooned to 200 million in March from 10 million last year  making it one of the few buoyant stocks amid the recent sell-off. New York State’s attorney general started an investigation into Zoom  calling on it to proactively beef up security measures  rather than just in response to negative press reports about lapses in privacy protection. And the F.B.I. warned that Zoom was susceptible to a form of digital hijacking known as “Zoombombing” following incidents where hackers joined online meetings to harass participants with racist or graphic taunts  raising the specter that personal user data might be vulnerable  too. The New York Times also found that Zoom displayed some data from people’s LinkedIn profiles without their permission  a flaw Zoom says it has fixed. Zoom’s chief executive  Eric Yuan  apologized for the lax security practices  including the transfer of customer data en masse to Facebook  reported by Motherboard. The company said it was halting new feature releases for three months to focus on security. Skittish about risks to the privacy of their students  a number of school districts  including those in New York City  Pittsburgh and Clark County  Nev.  home of Las Vegas  won’t allow classes to be conducted over Zoom  further interrupting the already bumpy launch of virtual learning. Officials said they were concerned that default settings allow for heightened data gathering and that parents may not have the tech savvy to disable such features. Jeff Ericson  a father of two students in Pittsburgh  said he’d grudgingly agree to whatever terms Microsoft sets for use of its video software in the district. “Like anybody  I care about my kids’ privacy  but I also don’t want them missing out on any more time with their teacher  so what choice do I have really?” he said. Technology companies see an opportunity in this crisis. Verily  a division of Google’s parent company  requires a Google account to find and arrange coronavirus testing and says it may share your personal health information with contractors  government agencies and other outside parties. Video-chat tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams are stirring concerns that they may be using data vacuuming technologies on the most vulnerable. Schools and businesses that now rely on such services often give people no choice but to accept their terms of service. Harried parents seeking a remedy for their kids’ isolation could be forgiven for not poring over book-length privacy policies before connecting them with grandparents on video chat or entertaining them with a few hours of streaming YouTube videos. Elizabeth Johnson  a lawyer in North Carolina who specializes in data privacy  is at a loss for a solution when her two children  ages 10 and 12  want to use videoconferencing services that she knows will harvest their data. “I have no idea what to do about it ” said Ms. Johnson. “Staying in school now is more important than an amorphous future where companies have made inferences about my children as online consumers.” Time and again  corporations have shown that  for them  the value of huge data stores that can inform advertisers or their own product development trumps any potential embarrassment over how it was compiled. Smart home speakers record our private conversations  and smartphones track users with distressingly accurate precision. A recent study from researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that smart speakers from Google  Apple and Amazon can accidentally activate as many as 19 times daily and record snippets of more than 40 seconds without users knowing. Not content with having millions of Americans forced onto their platforms for work or pleasure  the tech industry is also using the pandemic as an excuse to seek the rollback of the modest privacy protections that exist. In January  millions of Americans got the opportunity for the first time to request a detailed readout of the personal dossiers that multinational companies collect and to compel those businesses to no longer sell their data  thanks to the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act. The results were eye-popping. The law helped expose the extent of corporations’ data collection  including logs of every tap on a Kindle e-reader  detailed credit card data  email addresses  complete lists of past purchases and inferences about customer preferences  like which movies they are most likely to watch. Yet  as the pandemic bore down on the United States  a coalition of trade groups petitioned California’s attorney general  Xavier Becerra  to delay enforcement of the privacy law until next year. If a delay is granted  corporations will be reprieved from requirements that include disclosing personal information they collect about Californians. (The attorney general’s office has taken no action.) Instead of trying to worm out of privacy regulations  companies providing critical connectivity services should apply that energy to limiting data collection during the national emergency to only what they need to operate and to give additional reassurances that their services comply with child protection laws. Many companies make it exceedingly difficult to opt out of data collection  burying permissions deep on their websites or frequently changing privacy policies that dictate how and how often personal information can be harvested. Once you start using some services it can also be hard to stop  particularly if your files or photos are stored there  a desirable feature among tech companies known as lock-in. “They understand that we as consumers are lazy ” said Alastair Mactaggart  who leads the board of Californians for Consumer Privacy. “We don’t take the precautions we should  and these companies are able to capitalize on it. So this could be a boon for them.” It may be tempting for corporations to view their ballooning user numbers during the pandemic as a harbinger of long-term prosperity. But consumers need the option to delete user profiles after the crisis has abated  particularly if they have stored sensitive information about their children  and they deserve easy access to what has been collected. Americans have lost control over a lot as a result of the coronavirus. At least they should be able to control what happens to their personal data.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/biden-campaign-covid.html, opinion, What America Needs Next: A Biden National Unity Cabinet, We need a political system that mirrors the best in us., Supported by We need a political system that mirrors the best in us. By Thomas L. Friedman Opinion Columnist In the last Democratic debate  Joe Biden declared that he would nominate a woman as his vice-presidential running mate. That felt right at the time. But times have changed. Biden needs to go much  much further: At the Democratic convention he needs to name not just his vice president  but his entire cabinet. And it needs to be a totally different kind of cabinet — a national unity cabinet — from Democrats on the Bernie Sanders left to Republicans on the Mitt Romney right. Why? Because while most people are playing nice right now managing this virus  the wreckage  pain and anger it will leave behind will require megadoses of solidarity and healing from the top. And even if we get to the other side of this crisis by January  there are going to be a set of wrenching debates around who got bailed out and who didn’t and around how much civil liberty we should sacrifice to track and quarantine Covid-19 carriers until there is a vaccine. If handled on a partisan basis  those issues will rip our country apart. In short  if this isn’t the time to leave behind the hyperpartisanship that has made it nearly impossible for us to do anything big and hard for two decades  then when? Considering all the people who have come together in this crisis to tend to neighbors  contribute to hospitals  share scarce resources and learn from one another how to combat Covid-19  would it be asking too much for our political system to mirror the best in us rather than to continue to exacerbate the worst? Americans today deserve the government they need more than ever. It has literally become a matter of life and death. Biden  because he doesn’t run anything right now  has had a hard time demonstrating leadership. The one giant contrast that he could draw with President Trump  though  is the approach he would take to governing. Americans are not focused on this now — but they will be. And when they are  Biden needs to show that he isn’t running to be president of the 48 percent (or less)  as Trump is; he’s not trying to suppress the vote  as Trump is; he’s not running to squeak by in the Electoral College  as Trump is. He needs to show he’s running to be a majority president  a unity president — but not just unity for unity’s sake  but unity of purpose based on a set of shared values for rebuilding America. Biden should enlist people ready to embrace these values: 1) They have to believe in science — and not just around the coronavirus but around climate change  which is the next train coming at us. 2) If they were in power during this crisis  they have to have led their city  state or business in a way that took the science of this epidemic seriously from the start and cared for those under them. 3) They have to be open to taking extraordinary measures to help the poor  the unemployed and the bankrupted get back on their feet. 4) They have to believe that America thrives when there is a healthy balance between the public and private sectors  so anyone subscribing to the old idiot mantra of the G.O.P. thought policeman Grover Norquist — “my goal is to cut government in half in 25 years  to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub” — is not welcome. 5) They have to want to extend health care to every American  for starters by strengthening Obamacare and adding a public option. With those criteria  Biden could name his team of rivals. (I proposed an earlier version of this when the race for the nomination looked deadlocked  but the world has completely changed since.) My recommendations: For vice president  Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan  former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala or Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island; for Treasury secretary  Mike Bloomberg; health and human services secretary  Bill Gates; secretary of oversight for the trillions of dollars in emergency coronavirus spending  to make sure it’s done fairly and productively  Elizabeth Warren. Attorney general  Merrick Garland; homeland security secretary  Andrew Cuomo; secretary of state  Mitt Romney; defense secretary  Michèle Flournoy; labor secretary  Ro Khanna (who co-chaired Sanders’s campaign). Secretary of national infrastructure rebuild  a new cabinet post  Walmart C.E.O. Doug McMillon; commerce secretary  former American Express C.E.O. Ken Chenault; O.M.B. director  Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio; education secretary  Laurene Powell Jobs; U.N. ambassador  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. HUD secretary  Ford Foundation chief Darren Walker; Interior secretary  Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico; energy secretary  Andy Karsner (a green Republican who led renewable energy for George W. Bush); E.P.A. administrator  Al Gore. A fantasy  you say? No  no. I’ll give you fantasy. Fantasy is thinking we’ll be OK  post-Covid-19  with toxic politics as usual or  God forbid  four more years of Trump’s lying  dividing and impugning experts. Can you imagine the fights that will break out  as this crisis abates  over whose company  restaurant  store  nonprofit or local government was saved by Washington’s trillions of dollars in rescue packages and whose went under? The societal stress is going to be enormous as people fully absorb their lost savings  businesses and jobs  while defaults mount and worker rehiring happens much slower than the layoffs did. And that will happen in parallel with a debate about civil liberties. Just as every American after 9/11 wanted to know that the person in the next seat on an airplane was not carrying a bomb  until there is a vaccine everyone will want to know that the next passenger is not carrying Covid-19. And that will require highly intrusive testing and digital tracking. As The Economist reported last month: Both China and South Korea “are using big data and social media to trace infections  alert people to hot spots and round up contacts. South Korea changed the law to allow the state to gain access to medical records and share them without a warrant.” A U.S. national unity government with a strong foundation of expertise will be much better able to navigate these issues. As Gautam Mukunda  author of “Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter ” pointed out to me  only three previous presidents have been dropped into a crisis in this way: Abraham Lincoln in 1861  Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 and Barack Obama in 2009. “All three saw that they needed a cabinet made of the very best people in the United States ” explained Mukunda. “Lincoln assembled his legendary ‘Team of Rivals ’ which eventually expanded to include Edwin Stanton as secretary of war  even though Stanton was a Democrat who had served as his predecessor’s attorney general. Roosevelt made Frances Perkins  the first woman cabinet secretary  his secretary of labor because he thought she was the best person to lead the fight to create Social Security. Obama made Chuck Hagel  a Republican  his defense secretary.” Such a national unity government might pay another dividend: fracture the Trump/McConnell/evangelical/Limbaugh/Fox/G.O.P. — a warped coalition dedicated to nothing but its own power and cutting taxes on the rich. Our country needs a healthy conservative party. Trump’s G.O.P. is not healthy. If Biden seizes the moment to produce both a national unity government and a government that radically innovates — in ways we have not done for so many years — we might actually come out of this crisis stronger. “Roosevelt ” noted Mukunda  “proclaimed that ‘the country demands bold  persistent experimentation. … If it fails  admit it frankly and try another. But above all  try something ’ and Roosevelt fulfilled that demand with the New Deal. Lincoln didn’t just win the Civil War  he proclaimed that ‘as our case is new  so we must think anew  and act anew ’ and he fulfilled that promise through the Homestead Act and the creation of land grant colleges.” That used to be us … It has to be again. During the 2008 banking crisis  Warren Buffett said: “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.” So it is with pandemics. You find out which countries have taken governance seriously and which didn’t. You find out which companies are living on credit and which have strong balance sheets. You find out who has a health care system that can manage a once-in-a-century crisis and who doesn’t. You find out which countries  cities and communities have a high degree of social trust and can pull together and which can’t. You find out who respects Mother Nature and who’s dumb enough to challenge her to a duel. Well  by those indexes  with our bathing suit gone  we are not even remotely impressive. We are not who we think we are. If we fail to use this crisis to get healthy again — as a people and a government — it will not only be remembered for the vast death and destruction it wrought  but it will be remembered as the moment America ceded its global leadership to China.

One Passover Released Them., ‘I remember my father  before the war  hanging a matzo on the wall ’ my wife’s grandmother murmured  entranced. Suddenly  there sat a young Polish child., Supported by ‘I remember my father  before the war  hanging a matzo on the wall ’ my wife’s grandmother murmured  entranced. Suddenly  there sat a young Polish child. By Mendel Horowitz Mr. Horowitz is a psychotherapist. JERUSALEM — By the time I married into the family  Bubby Bella’s reticence was pronounced. A survivor of Nazi genocide  Bubby had resolutely overcome it  posturing under large-brimmed hats while ordering egg rolls and lo mein in Philadelphia’s northeast. Whatever demons Bubby knew in Poland were long silenced. Her wounds had in America become scars and like other women of her generation  Bubby kept them unseen. Beneath her traumas  her prewar memories lay dormant. Somewhere inside Bubby  an innocent child was lost. One spring  Bubby flew first-class to stay with our budding family in Jerusalem. Aging and not in the best of health  Bubby spent the days before Passover convalescing from her trip. In the company of her great-grandchildren  Bubby appeared content. My wife and I could sense our matriarch was at the end of her journey. For the children  however  and for Bubby  the occasion was joyful. I try to imagine Bella as young and without inhibition  but I cannot conjure up a picture. Though I worked hard to understand her mishmash of Yiddish and English  she never confided the details of her wartime ordeal. I know she was pregnant with her son when she and her husband fled to the forest from Korytnica  Poland. Was she in town when Germans forced its Jewish residents into slave labor  when the Germans stole all their valuables and when  in May of 1942  the Gestapo shot most of the remaining Jews in a pit outside the town? What were her defiant eyes made to see? Bubby would never say. Whatever tenderness she had known as a girl had been erased. How much of her childhood did Bubby remember and how much was she compelled by trauma to forget? After the war  Bubby and her husband  Victor  buried their histories and moved on. Severed from their roots  the valiant pair and their children  Mark and Ruth  made their way to Philadelphia  where they tended to tradition in a manner that suited them. From her patois to her potato kugel  Bubby was thoroughly Jewish. Though no longer Orthodox herself  Bubby took great pride in her Orthodox descendants. Just as certain recessive traits skip a generation  a compromised faith can take time to make itself known again. Reclining beside her descendants at the Passover Seder  Bubby looked radiant. Spending Passover with her great-grandchildren in Jerusalem was for Bubby a deserved coda to a harrowing life. Customs and rituals came alive that night in ways they had not before as we celebrated freedom with a Holocaust survivor. Tradition can be intoxicating. Bubby had yielded the formalities of Orthodoxy but not the informal rituals of Judaism. On the second night of Passover  my wife and I returned home from a late-afternoon outing to find Bubby primping before a mirror. We had left Bubby lounging and expected to find her asleep when we returned. Seeing Bubby in a state of frenzied preparation concerned us. The first night’s Seder had lasted long past midnight and sapped Bubby of her energy. Because of her frailty  we had assumed she would make do with the Seder we’d already had. “What are you  meshuggah?” Bubby howled  questioning our sanity in straightforward Yiddish. At that moment  Bubby was more Orthodox than we were. As we broke the middle of three matzos  a highlight of the Seder ceremony  a shiver seemed to run through her as she sat at the head of the table. Bubby had been transported to another place and time. “I remember my father  before the war  hanging a matzo on the wall ” murmured Bubby  entranced. Suddenly  there before us  sat a young Polish child with a lifetime ahead of her. On a whim  I placed the object of her fascination in a Ziploc bag and hung it from the curtain rod opposite her gaze. In the company of her great-grandchildren  time for Bubby collapsed. Korytnica had come to Jerusalem and the sickening wartime atrocities had never occurred. That mystical matzo shard held Bubby’s attention for the duration of Passover. I investigated the roots of this unleavened talisman. In Orthodox tradition  Passover matzo is prepared with flour safeguarded from moisture from the moment of reaping. “Guarded” matzo was thought in some communities to bestow protective strength. If only its power had been great enough to vanquish the evil that obliterated Bubby’s innocence. Bubby died years ago  but Passovers have been forever affected for our family. From a twisted brass curtain rod  Bubby’s matzo has been guarding us for over a decade. To those who notice the amulet  we retell the affecting tale. Our children know where they come from and on Passover honor their ancestry. With glances toward the yellowed Ziploc bag  they remember the night that Bubby’s childhood memories  which had remained hidden for so long  were revealed.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/energy-environment/coronavirus-oil-wind-solar-energy.html, business energy-environment, Oil Companies Are Collapsing  but Wind and Solar Energy Keep Growing, The renewable-energy business is expected to keep growing  though more slowly  in contrast to fossil fuel companies  which have been hammered by low oil and gas prices., Supported by The renewable-energy business is expected to keep growing  though more slowly  in contrast to fossil fuel companies  which have been hammered by low oil and gas prices. By Ivan Penn A few years ago  the kind of double-digit drop in oil and gas prices the world is experiencing now because of the coronavirus pandemic might have increased the use of fossil fuels and hurt renewable energy sources like wind and solar farms. That is not happening. In fact  renewable energy sources are set to account for nearly 21 percent of the electricity the United States uses for the first time this year  up from about 18 percent last year and 10 percent in 2010  according to one forecast published last week. And while work on some solar and wind projects has been delayed by the outbreak  industry executives and analysts expect the renewable business to continue growing in 2020 and next year even as oil  gas and coal companies struggle financially or seek bankruptcy protection. In many parts of the world  including California and Texas  wind turbines and solar panels now produce electricity more cheaply than natural gas and coal. That has made them attractive to electric utilities and investors alike. It also helps that while oil prices have been more than halved since the pandemic forced most state governments to order people to stay home  natural gas and coal prices have not dropped nearly as much. Even the decline in electricity use in recent weeks as businesses halted operations could help renewables  according to analysts at Raymond James & Associates. That’s because utilities  as revenue suffers  will try to get more electricity from wind and solar farms  which cost little to operate  and less from power plants fueled by fossil fuels. “Renewables are on a growth trajectory today that I think isn’t going to be set back long term ” said Dan Reicher  the founding executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University and an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration. “This will be a bump in the road.” Of course  the economic slowdown caused by the fight against the coronavirus is taking a toll on parts of the renewable energy industry just as it is on the rest of the economy. Businesses that until recently were adding workers are laying people off and putting off investments. Among the hardest hit are smaller companies that sell solar panels for rooftops. Their orders have dropped steeply as customers put off installations to avoid possible contact with the virus. Luminalt  a solar and electricity storage company based in San Francisco that employs 42 people  recently told most of its installers to seek unemployment benefits as the company’s residential jobs — normally six a week — have all but evaporated. Jeanine Cotter  Luminalt’s chief executive  told workers that the company would cover their benefits but that there was no money coming in to pay all of them. A half-dozen employees are installing solar at an affordable-housing project that has kept them working  and some who handle business operations are working from home. But Ms. Cotter worries about some installers who joined the company through San Francisco’s work force development program and depend on weekly paychecks to make ends meet. “Revenue has stopped ” said Ms. Cotter  who helped found the business 15 years ago. “It’s very confusing right now.” The Solar Energy Industries Association  a trade group  estimates that half of the 250 000 workers in the industry could lose their jobs at least temporarily because of the coronavirus outbreak. The association has downgraded projected growth by as much as one-third of the more than 19 gigawatts of new solar capacity that was expected this year. But independent experts  including Wood Mackenzie  an energy research and consulting firm  say those projections could be overly pessimistic. “It’s still too early to call ” Ravi Manghani  head of solar at research at Wood Mackenzie. “The situation is changing on a daily basis.” His firm estimates that solar and wind power will continue adding capacity this year and next. New wind installations might be down only about 3 percent from earlier projections  largely because wind turbines are typically erected outside urban areas  and many states have deemed construction an essential activity during the pandemic. In a report last week  Raymond James analysts estimated that renewable energy sources would provide 20.7 percent of the nation’s electricity this year and at least 20 percent through 2022. Although hydroelectric plants have long helped power homes and businesses  solar and wind power emerged as major energy sources only over the last 15 years or so. A sharp drop in the price of solar panels has helped the industry expand. Last year  solar capacity increased 23 percent from the year before. It added 13.3 gigawatts  exceeding new wind and natural-gas generation  according to industry data. “We blew through all of the projections ” said Caton Fenz  chief executive of ConnectGen  a wind  solar and electricity-storage developer based in Houston. “We’re surfing a long-term wave ” he said. “We just can’t get specific things done because of the pandemic  but I don’t think that affects the broader trajectory.” His company  which is 22 months old  has 3 000 megawatts — the equivalent of three large power plants — under development in 11 states. About 40 percent is wind projects  40 percent solar and the rest electricity storage. Among the company’s backers is 547 Energy  an investment firm that specializes in renewable energy. Gabriel Alonso  who runs 547 Energy  said his firm received its funding from Quantum Energy Partners  which had long been an investor in oil and natural gas. “As an investor in clean energy  renewable energy  the fundamentals that drove us to invest have not changed ” Mr. Alonso said. Even as the pandemic spread  Mr. Alonso’s company won a bid last week for part of a new electricity project in Greece. His company will develop a wind farm in the northern regions of Imathia and Kozani. The auction  on Thursday  was part of a larger effort by Greece to retire fossil fuel plants and replace them with renewables. Many renewable companies have projects around the world and have benefited from government efforts to address climate change. That has helped drive down costs of wind and solar equipment and made the industry more resilient to economic swings. In addition  because developers can build wind and solar farms more quickly than natural-gas  coal and nuclear plants  Mr. Alonso said  the renewables have become more attractive financially. In difficult economic times like these  he said  private equity investors like Quantum are eager to seize on businesses that can quickly scale up and start earning money. That said  solar businesses in particular are worried that the disruptions caused by the pandemic are serious enough that they are seeking help from Congress. Lobbyists for renewable energy are asking lawmakers to make it easier for their industry to take advantage of tax credits the government provides for wind and solar power. Developers usually enter into partnerships with banks and other financial institutions that can more efficiently make use of the tax credits than the contractors building renewable energy projects. The banks receive the tax credit and a share of the cash flow from the project typically for six to 10 years. But because demand for loans has shot up as businesses across the economy struggle  banks have been less able to finance new projects  said Josh Goldstein  chief operating officer at 8minute Solar Energy  a developer of large solar farms. Solar and wind industry officials want Congress to streamline the process for obtaining tax credits and make the credits refundable so that their businesses could benefit directly. “Their credit committees are in crisis mode ” Mr. Goldstein said about banks. “This disruption can have a particularly damaging effect.” 8minute Solar was recently forced to suspend work on the Lotus Solar Project  a 67-megawatt solar farm north of Fresno  Calif.  that it is building for Allianz Global Investors. Officials said it was unclear whether the work  which employed about 50 people  was considered “essential.” But the Department of Homeland Security included electricity production on its list of essential activities last month  affirming legal advice that 8minute had received  and the company sent workers back to finish construction. The solar industry expected to add more panels in 2020 than in any other previous year  said Abigail Hopper  president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. That won’t happen now  but the industry is still poised to add capacity. “We believe  over the long run  we are well positioned to outcompete incumbent generators ” Ms. Hopper said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/coronavirus-cruise-industry-carnival.html, business, Cruise Industry  a Symbol of the Pandemic  Scrambles to Survive, Carnival and the other big companies have no revenue and face questions over whether customers will return once the threat of the coronavirus passes., Supported by Carnival and the other big companies have no revenue and face questions over whether customers will return once the threat of the coronavirus passes. By David Yaffe-Bellany First  there was the Diamond Princess  stranded off the coast of Japan as the coronavirus infected hundreds of passengers. Then the Westerdam  circling in the sea for days with nowhere to dock. Then the Grand Princess  the Costa Luminosa and the Zaandam. Cruise ships have been a focal point of the coronavirus pandemic from the beginning  widely blamed for a series of major outbreaks that spread the disease across the world. Now  the companies that own those ships face a potential financial catastrophe. With most international travel halted  they have virtually no revenue. They have become symbols of deadly contagion. And despite assurances from President Trump  they were left out of the $2 trillion stimulus package Congress passed last month. While analysts say the major cruise lines have enough money to survive at least another six months  the companies are scrambling to line up new financing in anticipation of a slowdown that could last even longer. The Carnival Corporation  which serves nearly 11.5 million travelers a year  or roughly 50 percent of the global cruise market  is at the center of the crisis. Over the last couple of months  the company has had highly publicized outbreaks on several of its ships  including the Diamond Princess and the Zaandam  which has been trying to unload sick passengers in Florida. Since the beginning of the year  the company’s share price has plummeted more than 80 percent  though on Monday it rose sharply — to $10.21 a share — after Saudi Arabia’s state investment fund said it had acquired a stake in the company. And last week  Carnival  which has already drawn on bank credit lines  began an effort to raise $6 billion by selling stock  bonds and other securities. It was selling some of those bonds with a suggested 12.5 percent interest payment to investors  a strikingly high figure. In an interview  Carnival’s chief executive  Arnold Donald  said the sale would generate enough cash for the company to survive without revenue into 2021. He added that Carnival hoped to take advantage of stimulus programs in other countries where it operates  like Germany  Britain and Australia. “If you run out of cash  you lose the company  and we can’t live with that ” Mr. Donald said. “So we want to make sure we’re prepared for an extreme case.” Last week  a voluntary one-month suspension of cruise travel became much longer  with some companies canceling voyages scheduled for October and November. Mr. Donald acknowledged that it was a precarious moment. The high interest rate on the debt deal “is absolutely going to be a challenge to us ” he said. “It’s not fun to be floating equity at the share price it is ” he added. “It’s very disappointing.” Before the equity offering  Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America had been working to put together a debt deal for Carnival that would offer some investors a potential return in the high teens  according to two people familiar with the discussions. Bankers pitched the deal to hedge funds and private equity investors  some of whom passed on it because of concerns about the company’s long-term viability. The two major cruise lines besides Carnival — Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruises — are also looking for cash. Norwegian has tapped an existing $1.55 billion credit line. In March  Royal Caribbean secured a $2.2 billion loan  using its ships as collateral. Of course  the ultimate fate of Carnival and the rest of the cruise industry depends on how long the pandemic lasts. And even if the companies survive  it could take years for them to fully recover. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see the industry redrawn in some ways ” said Ross Klein  a sociologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland who studies cruising. “Perhaps some companies disappearing  others being taken over  seeing ships being retired.” In February  cruise ships became an early symbol of how rapidly the coronavirus could spread in confined spaces  when more than 700 passengers on the Diamond Princess became infected as the ship idled off Japan. As social distancing grew more common in February and early March  cruises were among the first activities Americans started avoiding. Still  industry experts hope that hard-core cruise fans will come back relatively quickly once the pandemic ends  though even the optimists acknowledge that getting people to go on cruises for the first time will require steep discounts and aggressive marketing. Another challenge: About one-third of cruise passengers are 60 or older — a group at higher risk of serious infection that might be reluctant to risk exposure. For Carnival  the initial coronavirus outbreak in Asia led to weeks of criticism  as the company fumbled its response to the situation on the Diamond Princess. Another of its ships  the Grand Princess  had a cluster of infections last month as it headed to California. Mr. Donald defended Carnival’s response to the pandemic  including its decision to continue sailing in early March  as the scale of the global crisis was becoming clear. (Carnival eventually suspended global operations  but it still has four ships at sea.) “We don’t try to play God. We don’t try to play government ” Mr. Donald said. “We comply. We listen to what people say we need to do.” Last month  he and other industry leaders held talks with the White House coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence. In those conversations  Mr. Donald said  he pushed for a federal loan guarantee that would allow the cruise companies to obtain funding at lower interest rates. And Micky Arison  the chairman of Carnival’s board  has had several calls with Mr. Trump  who last month described the cruise lines as “prime candidates” for federal support. But under the terms of the stimulus package Mr. Trump signed into law  the major cruise lines did not qualify for funding because they are incorporated outside the United States  which largely exempts them from paying federal income taxes. A piece of that package “would’ve been nice to have ” said Felicia Hendrix  a cruise analyst at Barclays. Still  she said  the cruise companies are in a good position to weather the crisis  partly because operating costs have plummeted. “You’re not feeding a full ship’s worth of people ” Ms. Hendrix said. “You don’t have a full crew. You’re not using the full level of fuel.” And unlike neighborhood restaurants and other small business that are now on the brink of collapse  the cruise lines started the crisis with healthy balance sheets. At the beginning of the year  Carnival had $518 million in cash on hand  Royal Caribbean had $243.7 million and Norwegian had $252.9 million. But because of the crisis  Carnival and Royal Caribbean have laid off or furloughed contractors  while Norwegian has cut salaries and moved some employees to a four-day workweek. The impact of the cruise shutdown has also rippled across the economy  hurting travel agents  taxi drivers and performers. Last month  one of Carnival’s nine cruising brands  Carnival Cruises  told dozens of entertainers who perform on its ships that it would not pay them for canceled bookings. Then a few days later  the company said it would pay them after all. Then it announced a new complication — the payment would come at some point in the next 60 days rather than the usual two weeks. “This billion-dollar company took this burden and moved it from themselves to us ” said Steve Burr  a 52-year-old comedian in Tampa  Fla. “I’m driving Uber now trying to pick up a dime where I can and desperately trying to file for unemployment.” For the last few weeks  Mr. Donald has been working from his condominium on Miami Beach. He has the place to himself — his wife is on one of the ships still at sea. Sometimes  he takes walks along the beach  marveling at the emptiness. “The pigeons actually looked confused because there were pigeons and no people ” Mr. Donald said. But mostly he dwells on the line of idle cruise ships anchored at shore  with nowhere to go. “They’re standing right out there as I look out ” he said. “It’s very surreal.” Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

By David Waldstein At a pub in London last month  shortly before Britain ordered its citizens to stay home  a small group of life savers shared drinks. It included Rebecca Shipley  a professor of health care engineering at University College London  her U.C.L. colleague  Tim Baker  a former racecar engineer  and some intensive care unit physicians. On the agenda that night was a discussion to devise methods of handling the deluge of patients infected by Covid-19. The doctors said that the most critical items needed were mechanical ventilators and continuous positive airway pressure machines  or CPAPs. Baker instantly knew where to turn. In another life he had designed engines for the Jordan Racing team (now Racing Point)  a team in Formula One racing. He knew that Formula One teams trained in shaving milliseconds off their race times are capable of producing extremely high quality machinery in a remarkably short span. The next day  March 25  Baker met with two engineers from Mercedes-AMG Petronas  the leading Formula One team  based in the British Midlands. They had lunch  then worked through the night on a new design for CPAP machines that could be produced rapidly. Within 100 hours of the initial pub meeting they had a prototype in hand  and within 10 days they had first regulatory approval from the British government to begin production. “We are approaching 200 already in circulation ” Baker said in a telephone interview from London  “and we have the go-ahead to produce 300 a day for a week and then 1 000 every day.” Like Mercedes  other Formula One teams are working long hours to accelerate the production of much-needed ventilators  and across athletics many sporting goods manufacturers are repurposing their factory floors and lending their equipment  material and know-how in a widening team effort to fight Covid-19. “Our company culture is an athletic mind-set ” said Ed Kinnaly  the chief executive of Bauer hockey equipment  which is making face shields for medical personnel. “Our employees viewed this challenge of beating this virus like beating a competitor.” Bauer  and its sister companies Cascade and Maverik  are based in Liverpool  N.Y.  and in Blainville  Quebec. Their factories normally produce Bauer’s hockey skates  helmets and face shields as well as lacrosse equipment. But now they are turning out larger plastic face shields  similar to welding masks  to be used by hospital workers as extra protection against splatter that could contain the contagion. Kinnaly said one of his engineers approached him last month with the idea. A design was created  the machinery adjusted and soon after production was underway. The company began by making about 3 000 units per week at each location and  as the work force grows more familiar with the process  Kinnaly hopes to ramp up production to 70 000 per week by the end of April. They are not alone. In Lawrence  Mass.  the New Balance athletic shoe company is making cloth face masks for doctors  nurses and hospital staff. Just outside of Oxford  England  the ROKiT Williams Racing team has joined with several other Formula One teams to produce ventilators and in Easton  Pa.  Fanatics  a company that normally makes baseball uniforms  is using that fabric — pinstripes and all — to manufacture masks and gowns. Last week  the New England Patriots sent one of its team jets to China to bring back 1.2 million of the desperately needed N95 protective masks while many other sporting goods companies and teams also contribute to the effort. And it is not just sports. Several other industries  including fashion houses like Prada  Gucci and Eddie Bauer  and perfumeries like Dior and Givenchy  shifted their factory production toward medical supplies and hand sanitizer for the battle against the coronavirus. In many cases the stories are similar: As people in the Western Hemisphere became increasingly aware of the shortage of vital medical equipment like ventilators  and masks  which help health care professionals guard against infection  people at those companies realized they could help. “I’m super proud of this team ” said Dave Wheeler  an executive vice president at New Balance. “They’ve put in 18- to 20-hour days solely because the passion is there to fight the battle  and we have the capability.” Wheeler said he and his technicians have consulted with physicians at Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s Hospitals  along with experts at Harvard and M.I.T. to expeditiously produce the best possible masks. They have retrofitted some machinery and fabrics from their sneaker production  but are also working with new materials  including nonwoven  melt-blown fabrics. Those could help New Balance to provide N95 masks  which block 95 percent of airborne particles that are 0.3 microns or larger  and can be used in emergency rooms. In Charlotte  N.C.  TheMagic5  a fairly new company that produces goggles for competitive swimmers  has been sending custom-built goggles at cost ($15) to several dozen emergency medical workers  nurses and doctors in New York after they send the company scans of their faces. The project is in the early stages  but the initial testing suggests the goggles can be worn by health care professionals for long stretches without pain  adjustment or fogging up. “I was thinking  how bad would I feel if we didn’t help  if we didn’t even test whether they could work ” said Rasmus Barfred  a triathlete and one of the company’s founders  who lives in New York. “I think a lot of people in sports think that way  too.” While much of the sports world has focused on producing gear that protects medical personnel  the Formula One effort  nicknamed Project Pitlane  is aimed at helping patients. Covid-19 can cause severe breathing difficulty in its worst cases  but the CPAP machines could help keep people off the ventilators  which are in short supply. According to Shipley  the U.C.L. medical engineer  data from Italy and China shows that patients who use CPAP machines soon after infection are 50 to 60 percent less likely to need a more invasive ventilator  which also requires sedation. CPAP machines pump a continuous flow of air through a mask to keep a patient’s airway from narrowing. The Mercedes and U.C.L engineers are still perfecting air flow pressure to minimize oxygen loss as air travels through the new CPAP machines. But that is exactly the kind of engineering challenge that Formula One teams excel at  often making modifications from week to week on their cars through the use of state-of-the-art machinery at their headquarters. “I’ve been utterly bowled over by them ” Shipley said of the Mercedes engineers. “They’ve been phenomenal  not only with the commitment  but in the speed and quality of what they’ve done for us.” While Mercedes focuses on the CPAP  engineers from the other teams in Britain  including Haas  McLaren  Racing Point  Red Bull  Renault and Williams  continue work on the mechanical ventilators  conferring and collaborating like never before. “I’ve probably spoken to my opposite number at our competitors more times in the last two weeks than I have in the last 12 months ” said James Colgate  the operations director at Williams. “The whole grid has come together to help support this project.” Much of their work is aimed at helping the ventilator manufacturers scale up production at least tenfold — from 25 to 250 per week — and perhaps soon after by a factor of 100. Colgate explained that mechanical ventilators are the size of a shoe box  with 800 parts  some of them tiny; but not as complex as a Formula One car. “It’s in the DNA of motor sports to find solutions quickly and we are fiercely competitive ” Colgate said. “Now we are just focusing our competitive spirit on this instead. Doing it quickly and safely is what Formula One is good at.” Vanessa Friedman contributed reporting.

By Jeré Longman HAVERTOWN  Pa. — On Saturday morning  a jogger wearing a mask passed our house. I was planning to run for an hour that day in solidarity with a colleague who was raising money for coronavirus aid by hosting a virtual race online. But first  my wife  Debby  and I drove 45 minutes to see our daughter. We seemed like spies making a dead drop  leaving mail-order steaks on her porch and giving her a virtual hug  while she left frozen fruit and Lysol wipes in return. In the car  Debby cried. “That’s the worst part ” she said. “You can’t even hug your own daughter.” There are ways to escape home confinement during the pandemic. Running has come to feel vital and now seems to be as much about reconnaissance as exercise. My runs begin in my basement. To kick-start this soon-to-be 66-year-old body  I have made space for a mat  a stretching strap  ankle weights  resistance bands and an oversize exercise ball that scares the cat the way the rolling boulder scared Indiana Jones in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” I do the usual planking and bridging and plying of knees that crackle like a yule log. Then it’s upstairs for makeshift squats while holding a 20-pound bag of birdseed. Finally  I’m out the door  walking first to warm up  climbing the hill past the restaurant that made a run of it serving takeout but is now temporarily closed. No one is happier to see me go than Debby. I’m driving her crazy. The other day  I complained that there was too much air in the water of the bathroom faucet. “I’m a possum ” she keeps telling me  “pretending to sleep so you won’t bother me.” Haverford College  nearby  has closed its nature trail. Paths are blocked by signs and yellow “Do Not Enter” tape  as if Covid-19 is a crime as much as a pandemic. So I run instead along the main roads in this Philadelphia suburb  past stone churches and homes and my shuttered gym  once a movie theater  its walls painted with caricatures of Jack Nicholson in “The Shining” and the Three Stooges being squeezed by Hercules. Individual footsteps echo in the quiet. Friends stand apart while talking  as if about to play invisible table tennis. Two men argue in a language I cannot understand but maintain social-distancing guidelines  walking single file along the sidewalk  more than six feet between them as they continue their disagreement. Early spring here feels like summer at the Jersey Shore. Families walk unhurriedly  dogs on leashes  children riding bikes  perhaps stopping at the ice cream store that remains open but seems to limit the number of customers inside. Cherry trees blossom and chalk drawings decorate the sidewalks. A radio station plays Christmas songs to cheer us up. People give slight nods and waves that signal we are all in this together. But we know from 9/11 that the nods and waves are probably temporary and will fade once impersonal normalcy returns. Wariness accompanies geniality. I turn a corner and jog slightly uphill near the post office. A man and his young son are hitting tennis balls in the road. I get no closer than 30 feet before the father says  “Other side ” and the boy hurries with his racket across the street. On my route  I pick up snippets of conversation as if listening to a radio on search: “Children don’t understand that growth comes from hardship.” “I undress in the laundry room so my clothes don’t spread germs everywhere.” I am running more than I want. I miss the gym. Stupidly  I hobbled the 26.2 miles of the New York City Marathon on a bad knee in November and have been in physical therapy since. Before the pandemic intervened  I changed my workout routine  running less  going to the gym more  lifting weights to strengthen the muscles around my knee and to tone my upper body. One night  I came home and told Debby  “I got arrested.” Alarmed  she said  “What happened?” I flexed my biceps and said  “Carrying guns without a permit.” “BB guns ” she said. In the evening on Saturday  I finally got my five miles in for coronavirus aid. Green lights came on in a sober township ritual  honoring several high school students who have cancer. A firehouse siren pierced the silence. But it soon grew quiet again in the gloaming  and I could hear another runner breathing across a four-lane road. On Sunday  I spoke to Meghan Hicks  an ultrarunner from Silverton  Colo. We met a year ago in Morocco when I was covering the Marathon des Sables  a six-day race through the Sahara that she won in 2013. On Saturday  she and her husband  who operate the website iRunFar.com  hosted one of many virtual races that have popped up. Some allow runners to register online  pick a distance and a starting line  whether it’s a street or a treadmill  upload their finishing times and receive a medal in the mail. About 1 700 people from 48 countries and all 50 states signed up to exercise for an hour in Hicks’s virtual race. All of the entry fees  totaling $52 000 so far  will be donated to the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund  she said. The race was part of a larger project  Operation Inspiration  meant to make running a communal event in this time of isolation. On Saturday  shut-ins in Italy and Japan ran up and down stairwells. A man in South Africa did a 10K in his garden. A woman in Jordan ran among the rebar and satellite dishes atop her apartment building. “A human being has to move ” Hicks said. “We have to get out into the world. You can’t put a human with a lifetime in motion not in motion. We all have the means to keep moving our bodies. It’s just figuring out what works best in your own situation.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/sports/07virus-jereonrunning-1/07virus-jereonrunning-1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/drake-toosie-slide-tiktok.html, arts music, It’s a TikTok! No  It’s a Song! Drake and the Viral Feedback Loop, “Toosie Slide” is one of a few new hip-hop songs that weren’t songs first — they were ideas spreading on social media., Supported by Critic’s Notebook “Toosie Slide” is one of a few new hip-hop songs that weren’t songs first — they were ideas spreading on social media. By Jon Caramanica Drake’s new single “Toosie Slide” was released on Friday  but that’s only if you think of a song’s release in an old-fashioned way — which is to say  a full song and an accompanying official video put out by the artist himself. “Toosie Slide” was truly let loose a few days earlier  when a well-known viral hip-hop dancer named Toosie posted a clip of himself and some of his dance celebrity friends — Ayo & Teo  Hiii Key — doing a smooth floor routine to a small section of the then-unnamed song  including the crucial dance-instruction hook: “Right foot up  left foot slide/Left foot up  right foot slide.” The voice was Drake’s  but the track was a mystery. Instantly the snippet  and more crucially the dance step  entered the slipstream of content on TikTok  where it began to spread. Drake  who has been in a symbiotic relationship with the viral internet for almost his entire career  had commissioned the dance clip  and by the time he made it official  “Toosie Slide” was already a hit. In the song’s proper video  Drake saunters around his Toronto mansion in a balaclava and gloves — a socially distanced lifestyle of the rich and famous — and is sure to hit the essential step. But there’s something uncanny happening: He’s participating in a scheme of his own invention  but also is just another person emulating a popular dance step  as if he weren’t both the alpha and the omega. “Toosie Slide” sets a low bar for participation — it’s a dance song that even those who can’t really dance can dance to. It is marketing stratagem first  song second. Maybe this is inevitable  though. Attention spans are shrinking  and the most effective modes of distribution favor the brief and interactive. TikTok videos end up like the equivalent of a movie trailer released before the film’s completion. The platform’s power goes hand in hand with the rise of snippet culture  in which sections of songs played by rappers — Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert  among others — on social media become cult favorites  and sometimes more popular than actual hits. Increasingly  the way to cut through the clutter is to do less  and leave behind a thirst — and an opportunity — for more. This has been happening organically on TikTok since the app’s beginning: TikTokers mine music (new and old alike) for snippets they can reinvent as short dances or comic films. Look at recent popular dances  like the one-pose-per-mood routine to Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” (“I’m a savage/Classy  bougie  ratchet/Sassy  moody  nasty”)  or the soundtrack to the Renegade craze: “Lottery ” by K. Camp — or at least the beginning of “Lottery ” a song that K. Camp eventually raps on. In the case of Jack Harlow’s “Whats Poppin ” the clips don’t feature a dance  but umpteen thousands of handsome young people shamelessly flirting with their phone cameras. “Toosie Slide” merely anticipates the response — why not just cut to the chase? Drake had already done this  unintentionally  with “Nonstop ” his 2018 song that recently became the soundtrack to one of TikTok’s funniest routines — see Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez flipping the switch and swapping outfits. And he is no stranger to feeding the viral maw. In 2015  the “Hotline Bling” video  with its lush neon-tone backgrounds and easily legible dance steps and facial expressions  was engineered for the meme era  every scene a potential GIF. But less well-known artists who are savvy enough to read online tea leaves can do something similar. For them  TikTok can also serve as a test run  a way to gauge potential interest in an idea  a sound or a lyric  before committing resources to it. Such is the case with The Kid Laroi  an Australian rapper who last month posted a snippet of a song on TikTok — “I need a bad bitch/Addison Rae/Shawty the baddest” — name-checking the TikTok superstar with 31 million followers  who’s been part of the dominant Hype House collective. With everyone in quarantine glued to their phones  a strategic @ mention can reach its intended recipient  no matter how famous that recipient is. On her Instagram story  Rae filmed herself listening to the clip  surprised  and then posted a clip of herself playing it for her mother on TikTok. Eventually Laroi and Rae spoke. “She was like  ‘Is this song  like  a real song?’ and I was like yeah  it is  and it wasn’t  but I was like yeah  it is ” he said in an interview with Genius. And so  in short order  it became a real song — keyword optimized  algorithm friendly  half-cooked but just cooked enough. Most newborn rap songs from relative unknowns have just the faintest chance at survival in the harsh digital clime. But a nurturing boost from one of the most famous young women on the internet might make it last. Choosing to name your song after someone famous is something of a gimme  however. Taking less obvious source material and reframing it into a song requires a touch more improvisational savvy. That’s not a phrase one has historically associated with Tyga  a genial hip-hop hanger-on for at least a couple of generations. But quarantine has extracted something strange  cheerful and winning from him. Curtis Roach  a TikTok comedian  posted a video at the beginning of March where he eye-rollingly rapped “bored in the house and I’m in the house bored” while banging out a beat on the floor. It was catchy  and just the right degree of comically exasperated. Soon after  Tyga posted a clip of himself dancing in his kitchen and spinning on his hoverboard to Roach’s audio (as have around 400 000 others). Before long  he posted a second clip  more ornate than the first — jumping from couch to couch  dancing on his pool table  washing his hands  walking like a cat on the mantle in front of his television. (Tyga has a big house  too  though perhaps not quite so Brobdingnagian as Drake’s.) He’d added a beat to Roach’s words — bubbly and light  like the jerk music that dominated Los Angeles hip-hop in the late 2000s — and in the caption  announced that he’d made a song with Roach. For the song “Bored in the House ” both recorded humorous verses. Tyga: “Tell the bitch chill like refrigerator doors/We can heat up some ramen  can’t go to the store”; Roach: “Locked down  I’ma stay stayin’ in-in/Ramen noodles every night for my din-din/Hulu  binge watchin’ episodes of ‘Ben 10 ’” and so on. It is primo comedy rap  the stuff of morning-zoo radio  and an elegant example of spinning gold from hay. Where “Toosie Slide” plays like a royal benediction — the world’s most savvy and influential pop musician spinning an entire digital platform on his fingertip — “Bored in the House” feels like from-the-ground-up playtime. We are all left to our own devices now — how nice it is to make a meaningful  if brief  connection across the social distance.

07/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/museum-security-coronavirus.html, arts, With Museums Empty  Security Experts Hope Thieves Stay Home  Too, The risk may be no higher  but consultants who help protect museum collections say additional safeguards are in order  given the closures caused by the virus., Supported by The risk may be no higher  but consultants who help protect museum collections say additional safeguards are in order  given the closures caused by the virus. By Colin Moynihan The location of where they work is a secret they keep  even from old friends. The artisans who operate out of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s storage facility on the West Side of Manhattan have long understood that it is part of their job to keep quiet about their place of employment  an off-site warehouse filled with much of the world’s finest art. So now  even as they shelter at home and worry about possible furloughs or layoffs by a museum struggling without admission revenue  the workers who help maintain the collection and prepare it for display say they understand the commitment they have made. “They feel a moral responsibility to protect this work ” said Andres Puerta of Local 30 of the International Union of Operating Engineers  which represents those workers. “They know the heavy weight of that responsibility.” Their concerns are mirrored across the quiet streets of a shuttered world  as museums work to figure out how to contend with the possibility of enhanced security risks. Alarm systems and uniformed guards are still in place  of course  and the sale of museum-famous stolen art has never been easy. But the pandemic has meant the closure of institutions and reductions in staffing. Cavernous floors are now largely empty throughout the day  not just at night. Police departments in many places are stretched thin by illness. Social distancing has meant that the many people who might once have witnessed a burglary are now tucked in at home. “The risk is serious ” said Steve Keller  a museum security consultant who has worked with the National Gallery of Art  the Smithsonian Institution and others. “Thieves might think the museums are in a weakened condition and that increases the threat.” Last week burglars broke into a small museum in the Netherlands that had closed because of the coronavirus and absconded with an early van Gogh painting  “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring.” Police responding to the museum’s alarm found a shattered glass door and a bare spot on the wall where the painting had been. Two weeks earlier  a gallery at the University of Oxford  also closed by the virus  lost three 16th- and 17th-century paintings  including “A Soldier on Horseback” by the Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck  to thieves. Museums  understandably  do not discuss their security measures or concerns  except to say that standard safeguards are in place. “The museum’s buildings are as secure under current circumstances as they ever are ” said a spokeswoman for the Houston Museum of Fine Arts  which has guards on duty 24 hours a day. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art said simply: “Sorry but we just don’t talk about security procedures.” Mr. Keller and Stevan Layne  the founding director of the International Foundation for Cultural Property Protection and a former director of security at the Denver Art Museum  said that museums are not necessarily more vulnerable now. Still  they recommended that institutions make sure alarm systems are functioning properly and that they more closely restrict entry to museum buildings. “Just because a curator left a pair of glasses on a desk  that is not an emergency ” said Mr. Keller. In an email message  a spokeswoman for the Guggenheim cited some of the same precautions. “The Guggenheim Museum continues to maintain 24-hour security operations with increased monitoring of all facilities and offices ” wrote the spokeswoman  Sarah Eaton. “During this time of closure  no unauthorized or unexpected guests or personnel are being permitted entry into the museum or off-site locations until further notice.” The New York Police Department  which helps to protect the Guggenheim and other museums  has been hit hard by illness. As of Monday  for instance  nearly 7 000 of its uniformed members were on sick report  which accounts for just over 19 percent of the department’s uniformed work force. In addition  officers have been making thousands of trips a day to ensure that bars and restaurants are closed and that people follow proper social distancing practices at supermarkets and in public places. Crime overall was down in New York City during the second half of March compared with the same period last year. But burglaries were up by nearly 17 percent. A police spokeswoman  Sgt. Jessica McRorie  said in an email message that “the NYPD has adapted swiftly and with success” to the challenges brought on by the virus. Asked whether high-profile targets like museums were being given special attention  Sergeant McRorie wrote: “The commanding officer of a precinct decides if additional patrols will be conducted at a location and that decision is based on conditions specific to the precinct and available resources.” For the duration of the pandemic  Mr. Keller said  museums should assume that they would be in permanent “night mode ” relying on security measures that are generally in place when institutions close for the evening. He said that some systems  like alarms  cameras and motion detectors  which if properly configured can show whether a person might be moving from gallery to gallery  could still be an effective counter to burglars  especially if security guards and other essential personnel like building engineers are provided with radios so any potential incursion can immediately be investigated. And while museum galleries containing certain artworks  like those on paper  could suffer from prolonged exposure to light  Mr. Keller said he had suggested that clients permanently turn on lights in other galleries so that any activity there could be seen  day or night  by guards watching monitors. Insurance levels would probably remain the same  he said  unless a museum was displaying works that were on loan from another institution. In that case  Mr. Keller said  the borrowing museum might adjust insurance to make sure the items on loan were covered. All museums operate differently  but they typically carry insurance that would provide coverage in the event of theft  fires and floods. Insurance for a permanent collection may be written on a blanket basis  instead of tied to a list of specific works. And some experts advise carrying insurance that will cover an amount equal to the part of a collection that may be lost or destroyed at any one time and making sure that losses are payable based on market value at the time of a loss. Beyond that  Mr. Keller said  he had advised museums to spread its most experienced security people out among shifts and make sure that the same teams of guards always worked together to lessen the chance that a single guard falling ill could infect an entire security force. At least one museum  he said  had set up cots and provided food so that a group of guards could essentially live inside the institution  isolated from anyone who may have contracted the coronavirus and providing a round-the-clock presence. But Mr. Keller said that the longer the pandemic went on  the more that security guards would have to compensate for the absence of regular museum workers whose eyes and ears can help protect institutions from more mundane problems — like leaky pipes that can damage artworks  or a desk lamp left on too close to a stack of paper that could start a fire. “The guards are going to have to be a little more attentive to environmental conditions around the building  the smell of smoke or the sound of water dripping ” he said. “Those are threats to the collection just as much as a thief is.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/dining/kosher-dairy-restaurant-book-ben-katchor.html, dining, A Rich (Very Rich) History of the Jewish Dairy Restaurant, , In a new book  the writer and illustrator Ben Katchor celebrates the places that have fed New York’s craving for blintzes  matzo brei and other delicacies. Credit...Alessandra Montalto/The New York Times Supported by By Julia Moskin Early last month  Ben Katchor and I sat in B&H Dairy  a narrow East Village restaurant  eating giant cheese blintzes topped with sour cream and discussing the finer points of their construction. Should they be rolled like an egg roll  or folded like a burrito? Deep-fried or pan-fried? Can you really make them with sliced white bread instead of the traditional pancakes? (Yes.) Then I asked a deeper question: In what culinary universe does a dish of buttery pancakes folded around creamy fresh cheese need a garnish of sour cream? Mr. Katchor shrugged. “It’s a dairy restaurant ” he said. “They go for it.” Places like this  with menus of blintzes and borscht  onion rolls and matzo brei  all lavished with butter and cream  flourished in Lower Manhattan in the early 20th century. The subjects of Mr. Katchor’s new book  “The Dairy Restaurant” (Schocken  $29.95)  were community cornerstones: cheap  filling refuges that made it possible for Jewish immigrants in New York to eat out according to kosher laws  by keeping milk and meat strictly separated  with fish  eggs and vegetables as neutral go-betweens. Most of the restaurants in the book have been closed for years  but that has not ended Mr. Katchor’s devotion. “Only after they were gone did I understand why I found them appealing ” Mr. Katchor said. “They were the last remnant of working-class Jewish culture in the city.” Mr. Katchor  68  has been working as a cartoonist since the 1980s. Like Lynda Barry and Art Spiegelman  he made comic strips that were not comical  paving the way for modern graphic novels. (He prefers the term “picture stories.”) “The Dairy Restaurant” has some of the same nostalgia for lost places as his long-running strip “Julius Knipl  Real Estate Photographer ” set in an imagined city that happens to look exactly like New York  but with places like Saltine Avenue and an abandoned Asylum for Pretzel Addicts. But the book is firmly — obsessively — factual  telling the history of this institution at a time when  as it turns out  everyone is feeling just as nostalgic about restaurants as he is. It begins by tracing Jewish beliefs about milk from the Garden of Eden (which he considers the first vegetarian restaurant  complete with a cranky host who ejects unruly customers)  through the diets of nomadic goatherds like Abraham  to dairymen like Sholem Aleichem’s Tevye who worked in Eastern European shtetls. The story arrives in the United States in the late 19th century — with Polish  Hungarian  Russian and Romanian immigrants — and peaks in the first half of the 20th with destinations like Famous Dairy in Brooklyn  Barnholtz’s in Los Angeles  Tolstoy Vegetarian Restaurant and Library in Chicago  and the once-palatial Ratner’s on Delancey Street  which finally closed in 2002. (“Only the onion rolls were good to the bitter end ” Mr. Katchor said.) After 35 years of research  he has tentatively identified the first dairy restaurant owners as Romanian immigrants who brought their staples of mamaliga (polenta)  soft cheese and placinta — a stuffed pancake that is halfway between a Polish-Hungarian blintz and a Balkan burek. In the extensive culinary archives of the New York Public Library  he found an 1890 advertisement for a restaurant at 64 Delancey Street serving “Buckarester” blintzes  kreplach and “mamaliga de lux.”(Yonah Schimmel  the famous maker of knishes  was also Romanian.) Like many successful restaurant owners  Jewish Americans often discouraged their children from continuing in the business. As the customers moved from cities to suburbs in the 1960s  when Mr. Katchor was growing up in Brooklyn  the dairy restaurants began to disappear. Most of the surviving icons of Jewish-American food are delicatessens like Katz’s on the Lower East Side and Langer’s in Los Angeles  which serve meat — lots of it — but no cheese  at least in theory. (According to the current owner of Katz’s  Jake Dell  it took decades of family debate to get a Reuben sandwich — corned beef  sauerkraut  Swiss cheese — on the menu.) Traditional “appetizing” stores like Russ & Daughters and Murray’s Sturgeon Shop focused on smoked  pickled and cured fish  and lacked seating. Only dairy restaurants  brightly lit and often tiled to emphasize their cleanliness — what Mr. Katchor calls “refined industrial hygiene” — were cheap  welcoming and safe for Jews for whom the possibility of eating nonkosher meat  even by mistake  was a constant concern. Mr. Katchor does not consider himself observant  but the book opens with extensive analysis and illustrations of certain Old Testament texts related to milk and meat. The specific prohibition against cooking an animal in its mother’s milk  which evolved into total separation  appears not once but three times in the Hebrew Bible. In Genesis  when Noah is negotiating with God after the flood  he agrees that people will not eat blood — the reason for the “koshering” process of rubbing meat with salt. In Exodus  Moses is able to receive the commandments because the angels who intervene between him and humanity are being punished for a deed recounted in Genesis  eating meat with yogurt in Abraham’s tent. These texts determined a fundamental part of Jewish life that led  over thousands of years  to our lunch at B&H Dairy. Open since about 1937 (though currently closed because of the coronavirus pandemic)  it is the last survivor of a strip that practically flowed with milk and honey in the early 20th century. Second Avenue had become the center of a flourishing international Yiddish-language theater movement  and dairy restaurants proliferated to serve the performers and audiences. At the same time  New York’s kosher home cooks were more or less continually locked in battle with the city’s kosher butchers over the price of meat. The retail butchers blamed the Beef Trust  a cohort of shippers  kosher slaughterers and rabbinical inspectors that controlled every aspect of the city’s supply. The result was a series of meat strikes  breathlessly covered in The New York Times and elsewhere  that included riots by women on the Lower East Side and in Williamsburg  Brooklyn. (One headline: “Housewives Go On Strike  March from Store to Store Proclaiming That They’ll Live on Fish.”) The aftermath was a long-term  citywide shortage of certified kosher meat. The advent of commercial refrigeration meant that fresh milk and cream were affordable and safe. And with progressive Jewish thinkers (most famously  Leon Trotsky) espousing vegetarian diets  there was a popular turn toward dairy meals. B&H Dairy has a long and storied history that tracks the evolution of the East Village from the Yiddish theater stars Molly Picon and Fyvush Finkel through Allen Ginsberg (an owner in the 1970s said the B&H stood for “Beatniks and Hippies’)  to Madonna and Sarah Silverman  who have all been regulars. In the 1990s  Mr. Katchor visited B&H every week to update his “Julius Knipl ” comic strip  which was on permanent display in the front window. He also met his wife  Susan  there  while he was eating a plate of gefilte fish at the counter. (She asked him what it was.) Originally  gefilte fish was a labor-intensive Sabbath dish: a whole carp  gutted with the skin intact  then filled (that’s what “gefilte” means) with a mousse made of the fish  and finally cooked whole at a slow simmer to extract the rich gelatin from the skin and bones. Today  the filling (and sometimes the gelatin) is the dish. “I don’t even like gefilte fish very much ” Mr. Katchor said. “But I always order it  because I don’t want it to disappear.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram  Facebook  YouTube and Pinterest.

By David Tanis Even though spring has arrived  with daffodils popping up and trees in blossom  it’s still mostly cold and damp on the East Coast. It makes a person want to head for warmer climes. But  alas  there’s no travel in these blighted times. And the warmer spots I dream about are plagued with worry and grief as pandemic illness makes its way around the world. We may take journeys in the kitchen  though. Enticing aromas can conjure happy memories of places we’ve been  and that is a balm for now  when we are required to stay at home. Let’s take a trip to the pantry instead. It’s a hip destination. Pantry ingredients are suddenly in demand; pantry advice is freely given; quick pantry dinners are the promise. It has always been so  but it is good to be reminded  perhaps especially now  that a surprisingly good meal can happen with a few capers  a couple of anchovies and a box of spaghetti. Yet a friend said the other day: “I’m sick of all this pantry talk. Who even has a pantry?” Once upon a time  a pantry was a store room  or a large store cupboard  a closet or a cellar. Nowadays  the term refers to all the various places you store your basic supplies: the shelf where you keep the spices  the dried pasta and the canned tomatoes; the refrigerator door stocked with condiments; the freezer. We all have a pantry  and now is the time to make full use of it  adding other supplies from the neighborhood market or delivery service  as possible. Each of the dishes here utilizes a few pantry elements or basic grocery items and the recipes are meant for different times of day  possibly  though not necessarily  all on the same day. It is not dinner party fare  as this column often features: Instead  it reflects the current reality  presenting an all-day menu to feed yourself and your fellow housemates. The menu begins with oat porridge. For breakfast  it is often topped with brown sugar and cream. Though sweetened porridge is delicious  a savory approach makes a nice change. Think of oats as a fine substitute for rice — you don’t always want rice pudding  do you? I often prefer my oats with salt and pepper. Any kind of oats will do  but my inclination is for steel-cut rather than rolled. Steel-cut oats have a nutty whole-grain flavor and retain a nubbly texture. I add a fried egg  a bit of roasted pepper  a generous sprinkling of za’atar and a drizzle of good olive oil. If you can’t find za’atar (a heavenly spice mix of wild thyme  sumac and sesame used throughout the Middle East)  try using toasted ground cumin or a pinch of oregano. In truth  this easy  hearty dish is a treat any time of day. To make a very satisfying pita sandwich for lunch  you’ll need some common ingredients from the grocery store (chicken breast  cucumbers  olives  yogurt  herbs)  but it’s not at all difficult to put together. If you’re in the mood to bake  try making your own pita bread. It’s a fun little project  though a package from the store is perfectly fine. The yogurt sauce is the real star here. You may find other ways to employ it  a dip  perhaps  or to accompany steamed cauliflower or other vegetables. Meatballs are the ultimate comfort food and these  a mixture of ground lamb and rice  are especially tasty  perfumed with cumin  coriander and cinnamon. They may be prepared several hours  or up to two days  in advance — they reheat beautifully. Make the tomato gravy as piquant as you like  adding a good pinch of cayenne if you wish. The optional saffron adds a floral note. If you have the time  cook your chickpeas from scratch. (It’s best to soak them for a few hours or overnight.) They’ll cook in less than an hour and require hardly any attention. If you prefer  serve the meatballs with couscous. This cooking voyage transports us to the eastern Mediterranean  in spirit at least  providing a lot of flavor and a bit of sunshine under these troubled circumstances. ?Thinking about a glass of wine with your lunch of grilled chicken pita with yogurt sauce and arugula? Go ahead. It may be spring  but this calls for a nice rosé. What? You thought rosés were good only for the summer? That is true of ordinary  mass-market rosés  which are not made to last and begin to decline as the first leaves begin to fall. But well-made rosé not only endures  it improves. A good wine shop ought to have a selection of these sorts of wines in April. You could also drink that rosé with the dinner of spicy meatballs. Or you could switch to a sprightly red  the sort that takes to a light chill. Try a basic Beaujolais or a trollinger from Württemberg  also known as schiava in northern Italy.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-curve.html, nyregion, Despite Staggering Death Toll  N.Y. Outbreak Could Be Slowing, Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that glimmers of hope could continue only if New Yorkers maintain discipline and suppress an impulse to gather., Supported by Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that glimmers of hope could continue only if New Yorkers maintain discipline and suppress an impulse to gather. By Alan Feuer New York  the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak  has begun to show the first signs of controlling the crisis: Its staggering death and hospitalization rates have started to stabilize  according to figures released by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday. But striking a note of optimistic caution  Mr. Cuomo warned that the state’s progress could continue only if New Yorkers maintained a sense of discipline and suppressed their natural impulse to gather in the parks or on the streets  especially as the spring weather starts improving. “We get reckless ” Mr. Cuomo said at his daily news briefing  “you will see these numbers go up again.” The governor’s mixed assessment came as the pandemic entered its second month and neared what federal officials called a crucial moment for determining its future. The seesawing nature of the crisis was apparent on Wall Street: The stock market had one of its biggest rallies of the year on Monday  with the S&P 500 closing up 7 percent  even as the death toll in the United States surpassed 10 000. Even with the promising signs  the virus’s overall toll in New York State was still astonishing: Nearly 5 000 people in the state have died  half of those in New York City. More than 120 000 residents have tested positive  and more than 16 000 are hospitalized. And across the country  many states were reporting alarming increases in cases that were straining hospitals. Federal officials  who have cited projections indicating that the virus could ultimately kill more than 100 000 people nationwide  warned that the next few days could bring a ghastly uptick in the number of deaths and infections. In Florida  Indiana and Louisiana  the number of fatalities attributed to the virus more than doubled in a week. But there were also signs that the situation was improving on the West Coast  where the virus first surged in the United States. The governors of California  Oregon and Washington said they would send ventilators to states that needed them more. “We want every American to know that what they’re doing is making a difference ” Dr. Deborah Birx  the leader of the White House coronavirus task force  said Monday during the group’s daily briefing. “But we need to have solidarity of commitment from everyone.” Outside the United States  Western Europe reached its own important turning point on Monday: While the total number of patients on the continent continued to climb  the rate of new infections was no longer rising. The shift seemed clearest in Europe’s two most battered countries  Italy and Spain  where the daily number of deaths has been running into the hundreds and where the number of infections is well above 100 000. But in Britain  developments were grimmer: Prime Minister Boris Johnson  who has contracted the virus  was moved into intensive care on Monday night  one day after being admitted to the hospital. Britain had reported more than 5 900 new infections on Sunday  its highest single-day total so far. Mr. Cuomo’s fatherly appeal to New Yorkers to stay the course — and to stay away from one another — came at one of his regular daily briefings  which have become a kind of touchstone for many Americans in the past few weeks. As always  his presentations were filled with an array of detailed statistics. Though New York’s daily death toll peaked at 630 on Saturday  it hovered around 600 on both Sunday and Monday  he said. That followed a long stretch in which hospitalizations in the state were growing at a rate of 20 to 30 percent a day  but are now increasing at a single-digit rate. “While none of this is good news  the flattening — or possible flattening — is better than the increases we have seen ” Mr. Cuomo said. The continuing flood of patients into hospital emergency rooms has presented a daunting challenge to policymakers like Mr. Cuomo who are trying to predict on the fly not only where the crisis might be headed  but also when New York might be able to return to a semblance of normalcy. The governor said on Monday that schools and nonessential stores would remain closed at least through April 29. The governor’s staff  in attempting to divine the course of the outbreak  has been using statistical models created by the Institute for Health Metrics at the University of Washington  which has received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  as well as predictions generated by McKinsey & Company and Weill Cornell Medicine. Much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that the statistics themselves are far from solid indicators. The number of hospitalizations  for instance  depends partly on admission standards. Some overwhelmed hospitals are sending home people who are in less dire shape  but whom they would admit in normal circumstances. There are also indications that Covid-19 deaths are being undercounted — especially those who die of the illness at home  rather than a hospital. And studies have shown that many people never even know they have been infected  one reason the governor spent much of his time in front of the camera scolding those New Yorkers who found the outdoors too inviting to resist. “Frankly  there has been a laxness on social distancing  especially over this past weekend ” he said. “Now is not the time to be playing Frisbee with your friends in the park. Now’s not the time to go to a funeral with 200 people.” “I understand how the religious services can help with the grieving process ” he said. “But  as a society  the risk is too great.” To ensure that downward trends continued  officials in New York City announced that they were closing all dog parks and dog runs because people using them were not practicing adequate social distancing. City officials also promised to crack down on funerals where people were ignoring separation measures. On Sunday  after people complained about crowds  the police broke up a funeral for a prominent ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbi who died of the virus in Borough Park  Brooklyn. And the governor said the state was doubling the maximum fine for ignoring social distancing rules  to $1 000. Mr. Cuomo has continued to shore up the state’s battered hospital system  which  like those across the nation  is suffering from acute shortages of crucial medical supplies  according to a study released by a government watchdog. On Monday  nursing unions in New York called for more protective equipment like N95 masks and increased staffing during the pandemic. Mr. Cuomo also announced that he was planning to move more than 800 ventilators to New York City and its suburbs. The governor said as well that President Trump had agreed to a change in policy that would allow the U.S.N.S. Comfort  a Navy hospital ship that arrived in New York City last week  to care for people infected with the virus. The ship had previously been reserved for non-Covid patients  but was being underused because hospitals had so few of them to send. In another stark symbol of the crisis  officials of the Episcopal Diocese of New York announced on Monday that the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan would be turned into a field hospital. With the number of city residents dying of the virus outpacing the system’s capacity to handle them  officials were considering temporarily burying people in mass graves in a park  the chairman of the City Council’s health committee said on Monday. “It will be done in a dignified  orderly — and temporary — manner ” the chairman  City Councilman Mark Levine  wrote on Twitter. “But it will be tough for NYers to take.” A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed Mr. Levine’s remark  saying  “There are no plans to bury anyone in local parks.” Mr. Cuomo also stepped into the debate over the use of hydroxychloroquine  an anti-malaria drug  to treat virus patients  which the president has promoted even though the administration’s health experts have noted a lack of conclusive evidence that it works. Mr. Cuomo said that hospitals in New York were already using it  and that he planned to ask Mr. Trump to increase the federal supply of the drug to New York pharmacies. “There has been anecdotal evidence that it is promising ” he said. “That’s why we’re going ahead.” But the governor suggested that even though New York had reason to hope in recent days  the weeks and months ahead were likely to be grueling. “This is an enemy that we have underestimated from Day 1  and we have paid the price dearly ” he said.

Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/nyregion/07nyvirus-ledeallTOP/merlin_171338877_4d3203e5-4ca9-44f6-a49c-b30804ed6b0b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/europe/boris-johnson-coronavirus-hospital-intensive-care.html, world europe, Boris Johnson Moved to Intensive Care; Foreign Minister Deputized, The prime minister is in a debilitating battle after contracting a virus he initially viewed with characteristic nonchalance., Supported by The prime minister is in a debilitating battle after contracting a virus he initially viewed with characteristic nonchalance. By Stephen Castle and Mark Landler LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved into intensive care on Monday  a worrisome turn in his 10-day battle with the coronavirus and the starkest evidence yet of how the virus has threatened the British political establishment and thrown its new government into upheaval. The government said the decision was a precaution and that he had been in good spirits earlier in the day. But with Mr. Johnson’s aides releasing few details about his condition  the nation kept a tense vigil on Monday night  hoping for the best and experiencing  together  the frightening mysteries of this disease. In a sign of how grave the situation had become  Downing Street said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Johnson had asked the foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  to deputize for him “where necessary.” The pound fell against the dollar after investors reacted to the news. After noting earlier in the day that the prime minister was still getting official papers  Mr. Johnson’s aides said he had been moved to the intensive care unit in case he needed a ventilator to help his recovery. Not every patient in critical care is ventilated  medical experts said  but many are — or are at least given oxygen. The prime minister remains conscious  officials said. For Mr. Johnson  55  it was an especially cruel reversal. Just four months ago  he engineered the greatest Conservative Party victory since Margaret Thatcher in 1987  delivered his promise to take Britain out of the European Union  and set in motion an ambitious economic program to transform his divided country. Now  Mr. Johnson  a political phenomenon whose career has always had a quicksilver quality  finds himself in a debilitating battle after contracting a virus he initially viewed with characteristic nonchalance. For Britain  which had so recently emerged from three and a half years of paralysis and polarization over Brexit  Mr. Johnson’s illness plunges the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind. When the prime minister announced on March 27 that he had tested positive for the virus  he insisted he would remain firmly in charge of the government’s response to the virus  chairing the daily crisis meetings by video while self-isolating. It had been an occasionally shaky performance until then: The government initially debated how aggressively it would try to curb the spread of the pathogen. That contributed to an inadequate  poorly organized testing program  and reinforced Mr. Johnson’s reluctance to impose a strict lockdown on his country. In recent weeks  Mr. Johnson had seemed more in command. Britain has pledged to test 100 000 people a day by the end of this month. And the prime minister has become an ardent  if relentlessly cheerful  advocate of social distancing. Even after Mr. Johnson had isolated himself in his apartment next door to 10 Downing Street he released a shaky  handheld video on Friday  in which he warned people not to crowd parks during a sunny spring weekend. Mr. Johnson’s aides predicted he would emerge from isolation that day. But he said he was running a temperature and suffering a cough. Two days later  he was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London  still suffering from those symptoms. On Monday  Downing Street said in a statement  “Over the course of this afternoon  the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and  on the advice of his medical team  he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital.” Mr. Johnson’s hospitalization coincided with a call by Queen Elizabeth II for Britons to face the pandemic with the stoicism and self-discipline they showed during World War II. Her rare televised address reassured many  but barely an hour later  they were jolted by news of Mr. Johnson’s deteriorating condition. On Monday  the government tried to put a good face on the situation. Mr. Raab told a news conference that Mr. Johnson was in good spirits after a comfortable night in the hospital  a short distance from Downing Street. He said Mr. Johnson remained “in charge” of the government and was working from his hospital bed. But Mr. Raab  who chaired the daily coronavirus meeting on Monday morning  admitted he had not spoken to the prime minister since Saturday. The paucity of details on the prime minister’s condition or any sign of ongoing communication between him and Mr. Raab deepened the unease. Mr. Johnson wrote from the hospital on Twitter that he had undergone “some routine tests” because he was still experiencing symptoms. He also thanked health workers for taking care of him. In a Twitter post  Andrew Neil  one of the country’s most prominent interviewers  asked why Mr. Johnson had not spoken to his stand-in  Mr. Raab  since Saturday. “Something not right here ” Mr. Neil added. In Britain  patients who experience symptoms of the virus are being encouraged to stay at home if possible  a policy that suggested Mr. Johnson’s condition at least crossed some threshold of seriousness to warrant hospital admission at a time when the health service is stretched. British politicians from across the political spectrum offered their best wishes  as did the French president  Emmanuel Macron  who said he hoped Mr. Johnson would make a swift recovery. Buckingham Palace said Downing Street had informed the queen of Mr. Johnson’s condition. Lindsay Hoyle  the Speaker of the House of Commons  said in a statement  “This is terrible news. I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now.” On Monday  at his daily briefing  President Trump wished Mr. Johnson well. “Americans are all praying for him ” he said. “He’s been a really good friend.” The president suggested that American pharmaceutical companies could aid the prime minister by supplying therapeutic drugs  although there are not yet any proven treatments. He also said he and other senior officials would take more tests for the virus in light of Mr. Johnson’s ordeal. Mr. Trump has had an affinity for Mr. Johnson  whom he views as a like-minded populist. While the two leaders have similarities — including their initially skeptical view of the threat posed by the virus — they are quite different. Mr. Johnson  for example  has described his approach to the virus as guided by science. In news conferences  he has typically deferred to his scientific and medical advisers — unlike Mr. Trump  who has constantly promoted an unproven anti-malaria drug as a potential treatment  going well beyond the advice of doctors and public health experts. The prime minister first experienced the symptoms of the virus on March 26  was tested that day and received a positive result around midnight  going into self-isolation in Downing Street  but chairing meetings by videolink. Even people with mild infections can have pneumonia  which is detected with CT scans. Sometimes the illness turns more severe in the second week — the stage where Mr. Johnson is now — with increased breathing difficulty and worsening pneumonia. Blood tests may detect greatly elevated levels of inflammation  a sign that the immune system may be overreacting to the infection. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  has warned about some patients taking such a sudden turn for the worse after a week. Until just weeks ago  Mr. Johnson had taken a more lax approach to the virus than had other many European leaders. At a news conference in early March  he described visiting a hospital where he said there were coronavirus patients. “I shook hands with everybody  you’ll be pleased to know ” he said  “and I continue to shake hands.” Later  the prime minister hesitated to force pubs and restaurants to close  even as he asked people to stop packing them  and he left schools open after France and Germany closed theirs. The prime minister is not thought to have any pre-existing medical conditions though he has admitted to struggling with his weight  particularly during a period when he served as foreign secretary and traveled extensively. In 2018  he wrote in an article that he had cut out some high-calorie foods because he had reached about 230 pounds. For Mr. Johnson’s height — 5 feet 9 inches — that weight would medically be defined as obese  and obesity increases the risk of a more severe illness in patients with the coronavirus. Several other key figures in the government have self-isolated after suffering symptoms of the coronavirus  including the health secretary  Matthew Hancock  and the chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  both of whom have now returned to work. Prince Charles  the queen’s eldest son and heir  suffered mild symptoms and quarantined himself at his residence in Scotland. He emerged from isolation last week to dedicate  via video  a field hospital in London. Mr. Johnson’s 32-year-old partner  Carrie Symonds  who is pregnant  disclosed on Saturday that she  too  had experienced symptoms. On Monday  Mr. Raab said that it was too early to discuss an exit strategy from Britain’s lockdown  arguing that the focus should remain on social distancing measures designed to curb the spread of the virus. According to statistics released on Monday  more than 51 000 people had tested positive for the virus in Britain and 5 373 people had died  though there was some cause for optimism from figures that showed the rate of hospital admissions slowing. Denise Grady and Pam Belluck contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/06virus-britain/merlin_170946822_474dc734-591b-4282-a331-6acc752551d2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-stephen-castle/author-stephen-castle-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v3.png

By Peter Baker  Katie Rogers  David Enrich and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump made a rare appearance in the Situation Room on Sunday as his pandemic task force was meeting  determined to talk about the anti-malaria medicine that he has aggressively promoted lately as a treatment for the coronavirus. Once again  according to a person briefed on the session  the experts warned against overselling a drug yet to be proved a safe remedy  particularly for heart patients. “Yes  the heart stuff ” Mr. Trump acknowledged. Then he headed out to the cameras to promote it anyway. “So what do I know?” he conceded to reporters at his daily briefing. “I’m not a doctor. But I have common sense.” Day after day  the salesman turned president has encouraged coronavirus patients to try hydroxychloroquine with all of the enthusiasm of a real estate developer. The passing reference he makes to the possible dangers is usually overwhelmed by the full-throated endorsement. “What do you have to lose?” he asked five times on Sunday. Bolstered by his trade adviser  a television doctor  Larry Ellison of Oracle and Rudolph W. Giuliani  a former New York mayor  Mr. Trump has seized on the drug as a miracle cure for the virus that has killed thousands and paralyzed American life. Along the way  he has prompted an international debate about a drug that many doctors in New York and elsewhere have been trying in desperation even without conclusive scientific studies. Mr. Trump may ultimately be right  and physicians report anecdotal evidence that has provided hope. But it remains far from certain  and the president’s assertiveness in pressing the case over the advice of advisers like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the government’s top infectious disease specialist  has driven a wedge inside his coronavirus task force and has raised questions about his motives. If hydroxychloroquine becomes an accepted treatment  several pharmaceutical companies stand to profit  including shareholders and senior executives with connections to the president. Mr. Trump himself has a small personal financial interest in Sanofi  the French drugmaker that makes Plaquenil  the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine. “I certainly understand why the president is pushing it ” said Dr. Joshua Rosenberg  a critical care doctor at Brooklyn Hospital Center. “He’s the president of the United States. He has to project hope. And when you are in a situation without hope  things go very badly. So I’m not faulting him for pushing it even if there isn’t a lot of science behind it  because it is  at this point  the best  most available option for use.” A senior physician at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn  where doctors are not providing the drug  however  said the current demand was worrisome for patients on it chronically for rheumatic diseases. At St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx  another doctor said his staff was giving it to coronavirus patients but criticized the president and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for “cheerleading” the drug without proof. “False hope can be bad  too ” he said. The professional organization that published a positive French study cited by Mr. Trump’s allies changed its mind in recent days. The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy said  “The article does not meet the society’s expected standard.” Some hospitals in Sweden stopped providing hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus after reports of adverse side effects  according to Swedish news media. But Mr. Cuomo told reporters on Monday that he would ask Mr. Trump to increase the federal supply of hydroxychloroquine to New York pharmacies  allowing the state to lift a limit on purchases. “There has been anecdotal evidence that it is promising ” Mr. Cuomo said  while noting the lack of a formal study. Mr. Trump first expressed interest in hydroxychloroquine a few weeks ago  telling associates that Mr. Ellison  a billionaire and a founder of Oracle  had discussed it with him. At the time  Dr. Mehmet Oz  the host of television’s “The Doctor Oz Show ” was in touch with Mr. Trump’s advisers about expediting approval to use the drug for the coronavirus. Mr. Giuliani has urged Mr. Trump to embrace the drug  based in part on the advice of Dr. Vladimir Zelenko  a self-described simple country doctor who has become a hit on conservative media after administering a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine  the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc sulfate. In an interview on Monday  Mr. Giuliani denied any financial stake and said he spoke with Mr. Trump only after the president had already promoted the drug publicly. Mr. Giuliani said he turned to the issue after researching former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Ukraine  a project that led to the president’s impeachment. “When I finished Biden  I immediately switched to coronavirus and I have been doing an enormous amount of research on it ” he said. As it happened  Dr. Zelenko was born in Ukraine  and when they first spoke  Mr. Giuliani accidentally called him “Dr. Zelensky ” mixing up his name with Ukraine’s president  Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani said he brought a prosecutor’s experience to his research. “One of the things that a good litigator becomes  is you kind of become an instant expert on stuff  and then you forget about it ” he said. “I don’t claim to be a doctor. I just repeat what they said.” The Food and Drug Administration  which has approved hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for malaria and lupus  issued an emergency order late last month allowing doctors to administer it to coronavirus patients if they saw fit. Mr. Trump said the federal government would distribute 29 million doses and that he had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India requesting more. Dr. Fauci made his concern clear last week. “I think we’ve got to be careful that we don’t make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug ” he said on Friday on Fox News. “We still need to do the kinds of studies that definitively prove whether any intervention  not just this one  any intervention is truly safe and effective.” The same day  Laura Ingraham  a Fox host  visited Mr. Trump at the White House with two doctors who had been on her program promoting hydroxychloroquine  one of whom made a presentation on its virtues  according to an official  confirming a Washington Post report. The next day  Peter Navarro  the president’s trade adviser  who has been assigned to expedite production of medical equipment and become an advocate of the drug  upbraided Dr. Fauci at a White House task force meeting  according to people informed about the discussion. Mr. Navarro arrived at the meeting armed with a thick sheaf of papers recounting research. When the issue was raised  according to a person informed about the meeting  confirming a report by Axios  Mr. Navarro picked it up off a chair  dropped it on the table and started handing out copies. Mr. Navarro  who earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard  defended his position on Monday despite his lack of medical credentials. “Doctors disagree about things all the time. My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I’m a social scientist ” he said on CNN. “I have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies  whether it’s in medicine  the law  economics or whatever.” Mr. Trump made clear on Sunday whose side he took in Mr. Navarro’s confrontation with Dr. Fauci. At his briefing after the meeting  he said it was wrong to wait for the kind of study Dr. Fauci wanted. “We don’t have time ” the president said. “We don’t have two hours because there are people dying right now.” Some associates of Mr. Trump’s have financial interests in the issue. Sanofi’s largest shareholders include Fisher Asset Management  the investment company run by Ken Fisher  a major donor to Republicans  including Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Fisher declined to comment. Another investor in both Sanofi and Mylan  another pharmaceutical firm  is Invesco  the fund previously run by Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary. Mr. Ross said in a statement Monday that he “was not aware that Invesco has any investments in companies producing” the drug  “nor do I have any involvement in the decision to explore this as a treatment.” As of last year  Mr. Trump reported that his three family trusts each had investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund  whose largest holding was in Sanofi. Ashleigh Koss  a Sanofi spokeswoman  said the company no longer sells or distributes Plaquenil in the United States  although it does sell it internationally. Several generic drugmakers are gearing up to produce hydroxychloroquine pills  including Amneal Pharmaceuticals  whose co-founder Chirag Patel is a member of Trump National Golf Course Bedminster in New Jersey and has golfed with Mr. Trump at least twice since he became president  according to a person who saw them. Mr. Patel  whose company is based in Bridgewater  N.J.  did not respond to a request for comment. Amneal announced last month that it would increase production of the drug and donate millions of pills to New York and other states. Other generic drugmakers are ramping up production  including Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Roberto Mignone  a Teva board member  reached out to the team of Jared Kushner  the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser  through Nitin Saigal  who used to work for Mr. Mignone and is a friend of Mr. Kushner’s  according to people informed about the discussions. Mr. Kushner’s team referred him to the White House task force and Mr. Mignone asked for help getting India to ease export restrictions  which have since been relaxed  allowing Teva to bring more pills into the United States. Mr. Mignone  who is also a vice chairman of NYU Langone Health  which is running a clinical study of hydroxychloroquine  confirmed on Monday that he has spoken with the administration about getting more medicine into the country. Dr. Daniel H. Sterman  the critical care director at NYU Langone Health  said doctors there are using hydroxychloroquine  but data about its effectiveness remained “weak and unsubstantiated” pending the study. “We do not know whether our patients are benefiting from hydroxychloroquine treatment at the present time ” he said. New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation  which runs its public hospitals  is advising but not requiring doctors to use hydroxychloroquine based on a trial showing a decreased cough and fever with mild side effects in two patients  Dr. Mitchell Katz  who oversees the hospital system  said by email on Monday. Dr. Roy M. Gulick  the chief of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine  said hydroxychloroquine was given on a case-by-case basis. “We explain the pros and cons and explain that we don’t know if it works or not ” he said. Doctors at Northwell Health and Mount Sinai Health System are using it as well. At the Mount Sinai South Nassau County branch on Long Island  doctors have employed a regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin “pretty much since day one” with mixed results  said Dr. Adhi Sharma  its chief medical officer. “We’ve been throwing the kitchen sink at these patients ” he said. “I can’t tell whether someone got better on their own or because of the medication.” Peter Baker and Katie Rogers reported from Washington  and David Enrich and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Rosenthal  Michael Rothfeld and Michael Schwirtz from New York. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/wisconsin-primary-voting-coronavirus.html, us politics, Wisconsin Election Fight Heralds a National Battle Over Virus-Era Voting, , Supported by  By Astead W. Herndon and Jim Rutenberg MILWAUKEE — Wisconsin voters will face a choice between protecting their health and exercising their civic duty on Tuesday after state Republican leaders  backed up by a conservative majority on the state’s Supreme Court  rebuffed the Democratic governor’s attempt to postpone in-person voting in their presidential primary and local elections. The political and legal skirmishing throughout Monday was only the first round of an expected national fight over voting rights in the year of Covid-19. The Republicans’ success came at the end of a day that left anxious voters whipsawed between competing claims from the governor  Tony Evers  and his opponents in the G.O.P.-controlled State Legislature over whether Tuesday’s election would proceed as planned. It rattled democracy in a key battleground state already shaken by a fast-growing number of cases of the coronavirus. The governor had issued an executive order postponing in-person voting and extending to June the deadline for absentee ballots. But Republican leaders succeeded in getting the state’s top court to stay the decree. And in a decision late Monday capping the election-eve chaos  the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative-leaning majority dealt its own blow to Wisconsin Democrats. In a 5-4 vote  the majority ruled against their attempt to extend the deadline for absentee voting in Tuesday’s elections  saying such a change “fundamentally alters the nature of the election.” The court’s four liberal members dissented  with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing that “the court’s order  I fear  will result in massive disenfranchisement.” [Follow live updates from Tuesday’s voting in Wisconsin.] On the surface  it was exceedingly high drama for what amounts to a seemingly foreordained Democratic primary vote between the likely nominee  former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  and Senator Bernie Sanders  who trailed substantially in a recent Wisconsin poll; a host of local contests; and a general election for a seat on the State Supreme Court now held by a conservative. But what happens in Wisconsin has far broader implications for both parties. The state stands as a first test case in what both national parties expect to be a protracted fight over changing voter rules to contend with the pandemic — potentially the biggest voting rights battle since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. Evers was trying to push Wisconsin still further toward voting by mail. Since the pandemic first forced stay-at-home orders across the country  many Democrats have advocated a universal vote-by-mail system in November. Republicans in several states and the president himself are pushing for as much in-person voting as possible. Indeed  for the better part of the last two decades  Republicans have sought to tighten voting restrictions — pushing stringent new voter identification requirements and sweeping voter roll purges that disproportionately affected people of color  the poor and the young. They have done so  they say  to curb in-person voter fraud  which  despite their claims to the contrary  is exceedingly rare. “Wisconsin is just a microcosm. And it presents questions that the nation will soon have to grapple with ” said former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  who now leads an organization focused on gerrymandering and voting equality. “It’s a test of our democracy. And the question is  ‘Are we up to passing that test?’” transcript From The New York Times  I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”  Against the advice of public health officials and the wishes of its own governor  Wisconsin will hold its democratic primary today in the middle of a pandemic. Astead Herndon on how that happened. It’s Tuesday  April 7. March was always going to be one of the most consequential months of the presidential election. By the time we get to the middle of March  though — So here’s what we’re watching. Breaking news. Louisiana officially could become the first state to postpone its Democratic primary election over the coronavirus pandemic. — it becomes clear that the coronavirus global health pandemic has really upended the race completely.  After Super Tuesday  states that are scheduled to vote start postponing and sometimes outright canceling their scheduled primaries. Georgia becoming the second state to delay its presidential primary. Kentucky announced that they’d delay their contest as well. Ohio’s governor pushed back its primary just hours before polls were set to open. Other states — Connecticut  Indiana and Maryland. These are all states that said that the public health crisis was too great for them to hold in-person elections in March. But there’s one state that refuses to budge  even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. It’s Wisconsin. And what explains that? What’s happening in Wisconsin? Well  when most people look at these presidential primaries  particularly in a state like Wisconsin  they think that this is just about the two candidates at the top — Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders  and who gets the delegates out of that. But the reason why Wisconsin was holding out and keeping its primary schedule was really to do with more state and local concerns. Initially  the Democratic governor  Tony Evers  and state Republican leaders were on the same page. They both agreed that the April 7 election should go forward. And they said so for a couple reasons. Not only had the virus not really ravaged the state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the initial time in March when they were making this decision  but they agreed on the importance of the state and local races that would be decided down ballot on the same day of the presidential primary. I just want to make sure people understand the complexity of our spring general election. It’s not a primary election. It’s only a primary election for the presidential candidates. Races like sheriffs and mayors and court judges. There’s a particularly important Supreme Court race that’s happening in the state. And both sides agreed that filling these roles was important for the continuance of state government. How long do we potentially leave offices not filled because we’re into July and August and we haven’t held a general election? And that’s why they proceeded with the primary. You know  I want to give credit to Governor Evers. I agree with his decision to say that we are going to hold this election. Hm. So despite the risks of holding an in-person primary in the middle of a pandemic  despite the fact that many states are postponing these primaries  the Republican and Democratic officials in Wisconsin say that this is necessary for the functioning of their government? Right. And that’s the position they held for about a week. And what happens after a week? Well  kind of most clearly  the factors around the decision changed. We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin. The pandemic becomes more acutely felt in the Midwest and particularly in Wisconsin. And here is the bottom line — folks need to start taking this seriously. So today I’m asking for your help. And the governor issues a stay-at-home order like many other governors did across the country and closes all non-essential businesses. It’s not something I wanted to do  and it’s not something I take lightly. And people across the state are starting to say  well  if we can’t leave our houses  how are we supposed to vote? Right. And what’s the answer? The governor and state Republicans keep holding this line that voting was something that was so essential  that the primary was something that was so important  that they would try to find some workarounds that included expanding access to absentee ballots and encouraging people to use that measure. It included counties taking precautionary measures which include maybe drive-through voting or socially distanced lines. But besides all of these creative measures  there is an increasing fear  particularly among poll workers  that the election would be unsafe for them to staff. These are people who  90 percent of them are senior citizens. Poll workers? Mm-hmm. One of the most vulnerable population to this deadly virus. And they start dropping off  informing their local jurisdictions that they don’t think that they want to participate in the scheduled election. A survey from the Election Commission in the state showed that more than a hundred jurisdictions cannot adequately staff their polling locations  because they wouldn’t have the right poll workers to do so. Wow. That becomes the first real point of pressure to say  how can this election go forward? So what do officials do in response to this severe shortage of poll workers? Well  they go back to trying to find creative workarounds. So the first thing that some of the local jurisdictions do is close and limit their polling locations. Some of the more drastic examples include Milwaukee  the biggest city in the state  going from 180 polling locations  typically  down to just five or seven. And yet everyone still seems committed to holding this election? They were  until the virus intensifies in the state and cases increase. As the deaths increase  that’s when you see a real shift from the governor. Hi there  folks. Governor Evers here. And it’s a big one. So today  I’m asking the legislature to come together to take bipartisan action to ensure that every registered voter receives an absentee ballot to vote in the upcoming election. He proposes a dramatic expansion in the state’s absentee ballot voting system  essentially making it a universal vote-by-mail system. So I hope that the legislature will act swiftly to send absentee ballots to every single registered voter living in Wisconsin. The state would mail 3.3 million eligible voters a ballot  whether they requested it or not. And that represents a real change in how kind of the electoral process would work throughout the state. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an issue of democracy. I don’t care who gets the credit. I just want to make sure that everyone has a chance to cast their ballot this April. Thanks for watching  and let’s get it done  folks. And that’s when we really see the partisan pushback start.  What began as a Democratic governor and a Republican state legislature that were basically on the same page has now devolved into what is  by all accounts  a partisan bloodbath. From the moment that Evers proposes that every person would be mailed a ballot whether they ask for it or not  Republicans go haywire. Right now  Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald is calling this idea a fantasy. Yeah  this has probably been my biggest disappointment so far in working with the administration since this all happened. They say that this is not only logistically impractical — It was completely disingenuous for the governor to tape a video and post it as if this was reality. To float the idea that they were going to find enough outer envelopes  ballots themselves  inner envelopes with first class postage  and mail it out to 3.3 million people in Wisconsin is completely made up. — but also kind of morally and democratically wrong. You know  that happens sometimes  I guess  if you’re feeling pressure from one of your own special interests or from the party themselves. But — And Evers knows that state law does not allow him to kind of unilaterally make huge changes in how Wisconsin runs the election. Folks  I can’t move this election or change the rules on my own. My hands are tied. He needs the help of the legislature. And so one of the measures he tries to do is call a special session of the legislature  and encourage them to delay the election and implement changes that would allow every person to be able to vote without going in person. I urge the legislators to take this call for a special session seriously. It doesn’t go well. The legislature gavels in a session this past Saturday. April 2020  special session of the Senate will come to order. With no objection  the April 2020 special session will stand adjourned until Monday  April 6. And less than a minute later — April 2020  special session is adjourned. — gavels out. Whoa. This is kind of an extraordinary move by the legislature to really thumb their nose at the power of the executive and the governor. The biggest elected official in the state has called them into session and said  take up this issue. And they basically start the session and end it without doing what he asked. So the Republicans do not grant the governor his wish for a mail-in balloting system? Right.  Astead  why is it that Wisconsin has so quickly erupted into a really nasty partisan battle over something as seemingly basic as making sure people can vote safely in a primary election? I mean  that would seem to be in everyone’s bipartisan interest to protect life  right? I mean  Democrats and Republicans will be casting ballots. It would seem as if safe voting and public health would be an issue in which partisanship would be left to the side and that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the best way to move forward. But in Wisconsin  there is no issue in which that can be left aside. What we see is a state that has become so deeply wrested by Republican control that even something like safe voting turns into a mud fest. And for this governor  for the Democratic governor Tony Evers  that’s been clear since the day he was elected. We’ll be right back.  Astead  where does this political dysfunction that you’re describing in Wisconsin  where does that start? Well  the state is one that is unique in its political history.  Few places reflect the growing political chasm in the U.S. as does the state of Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a united Republican government under Scott Walker — Republicans won everything in Wisconsin in 2010. — from 2010 until 2018. They won the legislature. They won this Republican majority in Wisconsin. And this wasn’t just a Republican government that passed kind of conventional conservative bills. This was seen as really a laboratory of conservative ideas. Governor Scott Walker is the man at the center of a bitter fight that has cleaved Wisconsin like a block of its best cheddar cheese. And so we saw a government that targeted teachers unions  that seized power on key boards  and really kind of had a wish list of conservative ideas nationally playing out in the state. He proposed slashing spending  raising no taxes  and most controversial of all  sharply curtailing public employee’s right to collective bargaining.  Even as the state voted for Barack Obama twice — Incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker has won his re-election bid. — they kept winning. For the third time in four years  Republican Scott Walker has won a statewide election for governor. So by the time you get to 2018 — Major shift happened overnight. Wisconsin voters  you’ve elected a Democrat as governor. — when Walker loses his re-election bid to Tony Evers — The race was almost too close to call. But overnight  Democrat Tony Evers narrowly beat out G.O.P. incumbent Scott Walker  denying him a third term. — Republicans in the state legislature have already learned a lesson from the years prior  that it’s more important to wield power than it is to be seen as a political compromiser. So how does that play out when all of a sudden there is a Democratic governor in Evers  who I assume wants to start making compromises with the Republican legislature? The Republicans make clear that that is not what they’re interested in. Republicans  stung by their losses in the midterms  are moving forward with last ditch efforts to hang onto power. It’s happening in at least two swing states  Wisconsin and Michigan. The country is really watching this morning as lawmakers here in Wisconsin work through the night to amend and vote on a number of bills. So in a special session that happens before Evers takes office  Republicans do a kind of classic power grab. Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a series of bills late Wednesday night that would limit the powers of incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers. They pass a number of bills that limit the power of the incoming Democratic governor and take away things that were available to his Republican predecessor. Now the bills would put lawmakers in charge of litigation  which would effectively block incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Democratic Attorney General-elect from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. So Evers would not have the power to make key appointments. And another bill would require the governor to get permission from the legislature to ban guns. Evers would not have the power to regulate guns in the same way that existed for his predecessor. They also limit early voting  which is a kind of tool of access to the ballot box that has sometimes helped Democrats  because more people in bigger areas can get to the polls. These were all really nakedly partisan  and Republicans didn’t really even try to hide it. We don’t want to usurp his power. That’s never been our goal. Our goal is just to guarantee that we have an opportunity to sit at the table  negotiate and do it fairly. It puts us on an equal playing field as the legislature  and I think that’s a positive step for the state of Wisconsin. So that is the political backdrop  you’re saying  for this current battle over how to hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic? Yeah. It is that sense of affirmation  the sense of rightness that Republicans enter into Evers’s administration with  and it allows them to openly flout the typical means of political pressure that the governor tries to put on them around the election.  The legislature — they came in  the gaveled in for about 10 seconds  gaveled out and they moved on. They said that was not a serious proposal and said the time for proposals like that was several weeks ago when the crisis began. So what happens after that special session  that minute-long special session about the election? Well  there’s been a significant amount of legal legislation that has surrounded all of this political action. So much going on here at the State Capitol today. Let’s break down and give you a brief summary of what happened today  because it’s been a wild day politically. There was a court ruling that basically affirmed that the Republicans probably have control over when the election should be held  but the ruling expanded access to absentee voting. Republicans appealed that straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. And then on Monday — It started with Governor Evers issuing an executive order  pushing back the spring election from tomorrow to June 9. This morning  Governor Tony Evers issued an executive order to postpone tomorrow’s election due to Covid-19 concerns. The bottom line is that I have an obligation to keep people safe. — the governor makes his most drastic step  unilaterally postponing Tuesday’s election until June  claiming that he has the emergency powers to do so. This is a affront to the Republicans. Republican legislators mounted a legal challenge immediately. And they immediately initiate emergency legislation  going straight to the Wisconsin Supreme Court  saying that the governor does not have the right to do this. And just about an hour ago  the State Supreme Court issued its ruling  saying that indeed  the election will happen tomorrow. And the court agreed with him  ruling just hours later that the governor did not have the power to postpone the Tuesday primary  meaning the election will go on in person today. You know  Astead  I’m struck by the fact that earlier on  you told us that Democrats and Republicans in the state  they had basically been on the same page about this primary until the virus gets worse and the governor advocates for a different kind of voting system through absentee ballots. And then it all breaks down  and Republicans are attempting at every turn to block him now in court. And how do you explain that? I mean  how do Republicans in the state legislature explain that? Republican county chairs and folks in the state legislature say a couple things. The first is that their position hasn’t changed. They thought the governor didn’t have the power then  and they don’t think he has the power now to change how the election is run. The other point is that they see Wisconsin  again  as a microcosm of the conservative fight that could happen largely  and what could be a new reality of how American elections are run in this pandemic era. And in that view  dramatically expanding the electorate in these ways are not something that Republicans are all that keen on. Because what they’re worried about is an election in which people who may not have participated  or may not have come out  all of a sudden have the opportunity to do so and to cast a ballot. And that kind of changes the center of power within the state. What do you mean? If people participate in different numbers  in bigger numbers  if it changes the type of people who want to participate in the spring election that’s not necessarily always seen the biggest turnout  that changes who can win. And who has benefited from those systems in the past  and who might benefit if they were to change along the lines of what Governor Evers is asking for? It’s hard to say exactly  because we’re talking about an unprecedented situation. But we do know that the people who are typically benefited from early voting  from early registration  from online registration  or a vote-by-mail are people who usually don’t participate in the process — younger voters  minority voters  people that lean Democratic. And just in the ways that Republicans limited early voting in that special session they had after Evers won  it’s the same thought process. That when more people get involved  when people who typically sit out get involved  that helps Democrats. Mm. Do Democrats acknowledge that an absentee balloting system that is suddenly much more widespread than it has been in the past would be advantageous to them in Wisconsin? They principally try to appeal to voters using small “d” democratic ideals — the general  basic American principle that everyone should be given the easiest access to vote. They try to appeal to people through public health measures  noting how unsafe it is for people to gather at polls. But when you ask folks in Democratic circles  they know that when the electorate expands  particularly in national and statewide elections  that’s usually good news for Democrats. It’s interesting. This is not just a debate about how to vote in a pandemic  although clearly that’s what’s driving a lot of this. But in the background  from what you’re saying  is this other question  which is whether the systems needed to vote during a pandemic may fundamentally change who votes  how many people vote and which party wins. Exactly. This is not just about public health. This is about access to power and the kind of most basic fundamental principles of democracy. If the system that we have been traditionally used to can’t hold  what replaces it? And we’ve seen real resistance to that in this state  and we may see that resistance all across the country. Well  why would you say that? Because it’s very tempting to see this story as an anomaly  right  in that the governor of Wisconsin waited a very long time to try to postpone the state’s primary — perhaps too long — and the state legislature is this hyper-partisan  conservative  activist body that is trying to use its power for political advantage. So all those factors would seem to make Wisconsin a bit of an outlier. Well  what may seem like an anomaly right now might actually just be a pacesetter. And this could be a preview as to what comes for state after state. If you are a place like Georgia or Louisiana or Ohio that has functionally delayed its election by three  four weeks  and if this virus persists to that time  there will still be questions about whether it is safe to hold in-person balloting then. Right. And when those questions come and the remedies are proposed  whether it’s online or vote-by-mail or the like  these same struggles of power will persist. And we will see factions emerge that question whether the new systems are fair and who politically benefits from them.  Astead  thank you very much. Thank you. On Monday night  the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin  who had opposed extending the deadline for absentee ballots in today’s election. In a 5-to-4 ruling  the court’s conservative justices wrote that such an extension  quote  “fundamentally alters the nature of the election ” and said that all absentee ballots must be postmarked by 8:00 p.m. Tuesday night. Polls in Wisconsin are scheduled to open at 7:00 a.m. this morning  but it’s unclear how many poll workers will show up  how many polling stations will be open  and what kinds of protections will be in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus during in-person voting. Meanwhile  the virus continues to spread across Wisconsin. As of Monday  the state reported nearly 2 500 infections and 77 deaths. We’ll be right back.  Here’s what else you need to know today. I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation  Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon  a little while ago. On Monday  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  who tested positive for Covid-19 10 days ago  was moved into the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his condition worsened. Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special — strong  resolute  doesn’t quit  doesn’t give up. In a statement  Johnson insisted he remained in charge of the British government  but said he had deputized his foreign minister to act in his place when necessary. Meanwhile  Iran  an epicenter of the virus in the Middle East  said it would lift a nationwide shutdown of businesses and allow the majority of its workforce to return to work later this week. [SPEAKING FARSI] Iran’s president  Hassan Rouhani  said it was important for economic activity to resume — [SPEAKING FARSI] — despite fears that it could lead to greater levels of infection. [SPEAKING FARSI] And in the U.S.  the death toll surpassed 10 000 people and congressional leaders began talks about a second economic relief package that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted could cost more than $1 trillion.  That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. What’s more  the State Supreme Court contest is no small matter: The winner could play a pivotal role in deciding a partisan fight over a Republican-supported move to purge voters from the state rolls  which could greatly affect the November election results in a tightly contested battleground state that was central to President Trump’s 2016 victory. The race is so important to Republicans that Mr. Trump weighed in with a personal endorsement for the incumbent  Daniel Kelly. Until now  Mr. Evers had stopped short of acting on his own to move the election  instead urging the Republican-controlled State Legislature to do so as Democrats forced a court decision that extended the deadline for mailed absentee ballots to April 13. Republicans denied his request to move the election and sued to block the mail-in vote extension  ending in victory at the Supreme Court on Monday evening. The stakes were apparent in the lawyers involved in the Supreme Court fight. The Democratic team included the party’s top election lawyer  Marc Elias; among the law firms representing the Republicans was Consovoy McCarthy. The firm is currently helping Mr. Trump to fight congressional demands for his tax returns  and a named partner helped argue a 2013 Supreme Court case that gutted the powerful protections of the Voting Rights Act. As countless Republican investigations over the years have failed to produce proof of widespread  in-person voter fraud  Democrats have asserted that the Republicans’ main goal was to reduce voting by those from expanding portions of the electorate — people of color and the young — who tend to vote for Democrats over Republicans. Mr. Trump  whose false claims about voter fraud have gone far beyond anything ever alleged by his Republican predecessors  appeared to openly say as much last week when he complained about Democratic vote-by-mail proposals in Congress. “They had levels of voting that  if you ever agreed to it  you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again ” he said on “Fox and Friends.” His Republican allies echoed the sentiment  including in tweets like one from Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky: “Universal vote by mail would be the end of our republic as we know it.” Justin Clark  a senior counsel to Mr. Trump’s campaign  accused Democrats of seeking to “redesign the entire U.S. election system” with proposals for “one-size-fits-all federal legislation ” which he called “irresponsible.” Mr. Clark said the campaign believed mail balloting could “play a role during a pandemic by enabling at-risk voters to vote safely ” but said the particulars should be left to the states  most of which already allow some mail balloting. At issue are proposals from two Democratic senators  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ron Wyden of Oregon  to pay for a secure expansion of mail voting and provide easier access to mail-in ballots while lengthening early voting periods. The $2 trillion coronavirus relief package included $400 million in financing for voting — below the $2 billion  at least  that Democrats say is required — and did not include the other provisions. Mr. Trump  who registered to vote by mail in the Florida primary  appeared to be referring to the proposed expansion of early voting when he complained that Democrats “had things in there about election days ” which he called “totally crazy.” In an interview  Ms. Klobuchar said Democrats would keep pressing for more money and reforms in future bills  putting special emphasis on longer early voting periods  which would lessen crowds at polling sites. “Trump coming out against that is a travesty ” she said. “They are literally telling senior veterans they have to choose between their health and voting.” Even before the virus struck  Republicans and Democrats were girding for a record number of voting rights lawsuits throughout the states over voter identification provisions  the location of polling sites  and moves to purge voter rolls. But the pressure to move to more voting by mail has intensified the maneuvering  and shifted its focus to absentee balloting. “Covid obviously adds an additional concern that voting rights will be harder to exercise ” said Mr. Elias  the Democratic lawyer. “Therefore the need for courts to step in will be even greater.” Mr. Clark  the Trump campaign counsel  said Republicans would fight moves by Democrats to push provisions that would allow door-to-door canvassers to collect unlimited numbers of absentee ballots  which he called “ballot harvesting.” Signaling that it would be a major point of contention with Republicans  the Republican National Committee chairwoman  Ronna McDaniel  wrote in a Fox News opinion article  “The Democrats’ all-mail ballots proposal is a ruse to legalize ballot harvesting nationwide.” Richard L. Hasen  a professor of law and political science at the University of California  Irvine  School of Law  who follows the battle over voting closely  said that mail was more vulnerable to tampering than in-person voting. “We know that voter fraud  while very rare  more commonly occurs with absentee ballots than in-person balloting ” he said. But  he warned  Republicans should not use that as a reason to find more ways to curtail it. “While there are legitimate reasons to worry about increased vote by mail ” he said  “it’s not legitimate to fear increased vote by mail because it means that more voters would be able to vote.” Despite the position of the national party and legislators  several Republican governors and secretaries of states have  in fact  embraced increased mail voting  among them Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio  who signed off on a mail-only primary  and the Iowa secretary of state  Paul Pate  who mailed absentee ballots to all of the state’s registered voters. But both parties were preparing for all-out war in battleground states like Michigan  Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  which Mr. Trump’s campaign views as critical to his re-election prospects. “I hope not  but I fear Wisconsin is a preview of what we’re about to see in the rest of the country ” said Ben Wikler  the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Mr. Wikler said that the Republicans had been seeking to stick to the April 7 in-person election date to ensure low turnout  which  he said  would be a potential boon to Mr. Kelly  the conservative judge up for re-election. “I think it creates a perceived opportunity  even if the public health consequences are ghastly ” Mr. Wikler said. He later tweeted that the Supreme Court decision would “consign an unknown number of Wisconsinites to their deaths.” In interviews  Republican county leaders largely played down the threat of the coronavirus. Facebook pages for one county urged residents to vote Tuesday in an important State Supreme Court election  saying “the Left is up to their Lawlessness and corrupt tactics to disrupt and turn the election.” Republicans portrayed Mr. Evers’s move as politically motivated. “I think this is a last-ditch effort to change the results ” said Jim Miller  the Republican county chairman in Sawyer County. “People will think it’s been moved until June. Even if it does go on  I don’t know how we put this back in the bottle.” Even some Democrats on Monday were uncertain whether the governor  whose office was stripped of considerable power by the Republican Legislature  would win the legal fight. In an interview earlier  Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee would not directly say whether he felt the city’s residents should vote Tuesday. Mr. Barrett said holding an election under such circumstances went against “every tenet of public health ” but he also wanted people to participate. He never mentioned the possibility that the governor could use emergency powers to move the election. Early voters in his city had been proceeding apace. On Sunday  Isral DeBruin  a communications professional  was sitting in his Honda Accord  snaking his way in a line of cars to a poll worker  wearing a mask and gloves and holding a clipboard  who oversaw an early-voting drive-through station. Mr. DeBruin’s absentee ballot had not come yet in the mail  and with all the wrangling over the deadline  he decided to brave the viral elements and vote by car. “Nobody should have to do this ” he said. “I have no doubt there will be people who are disenfranchised because of this complete mishandling of democracy. Others will get sick. Some will die.” Updated April 13  2020  Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/us/politics/06wisconsin-primary-02/merlin_171339021_f0da3f4d-8d57-4a95-8245-322d9e17f914-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/29/podcasts/the-daily-album-art/the-daily-album-art-articleInline-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html, us politics, Trade Adviser Warned White House in January of Risks of a Pandemic, A memo from Peter Navarro is the most direct warning known to have circulated at a key moment among top administration officials., Supported by A memo from Peter Navarro is the most direct warning known to have circulated at a key moment among top administration officials. By Maggie Haberman A top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death. The warning  written in a memo by Peter Navarro  President Trump’s trade adviser  is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China’s leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States. “The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil ” Mr. Navarro’s memo said. “This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic  imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.” Dated Jan. 29  it came during a period when Mr. Trump was playing down the risks to the United States  and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome. Mr. Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak  saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu. But he went on to emphasize that the “risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked” given the information coming from China. In one worst-case scenario cited in the memo  more than a half-million Americans could die. A second memo that Mr. Navarro wrote  dated Feb. 23  warned of an “increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans  with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls.” At that time  Mr. Trump was still downplaying the threat of the virus. The administration was considering asking Congress for more money to address the situation  and the second memo  which circulated around the West Wing and was obtained by The Times  urged an immediate supplemental spending appropriation from Congress of at least $3 billion. “This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill ” Mr. Navarro wrote in the second memo  which was unsigned but which officials attributed to him. It was unclear whether Mr. Trump saw the second memo  whose contents were first reported by Axios. The second memo seemed aimed at members of the White House Task Force established by Mr. Trump to manage the crisis  and reflected deep divisions within the administration about how to proceed and persistent feuding between Mr. Navarro and many other top officials about his role and his views. “Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration ” the memo said. Among other things  the memo called for an increase funding for the government to purchase personal protective equipment for health care workers  estimating they would need “at least a billion face masks” over a four-to-six-month period. The administration ended up asking for $2.5 billion. Congress then approved $8 billion. Mr. Navarro is now the administration’s point person for supply chain issues for medical and other equipment needed to deal with the virus. The January memo written by Mr. Navarro was dated the same day that Mr. Trump named the task force to deal with the threat  and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from China  an option being pushed by Mr. Navarro. Mr. Trump would approve the limits on travel from China the next day  though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus. Questions about Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis  especially in its early days when he suggested it was being used by Democrats to undercut his re-election prospects  are likely to define his presidency. Mr. Navarro’s memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had at least considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than Mr. Trump was acknowledging publicly at the time. Neither Mr. Navarro nor spokespeople for the White House responded to requests for comment. The memo  which was reviewed by The New York Times  was sent from Mr. Navarro to the National Security Council and then distributed to several officials across the administration  people familiar with the events said. It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney  then the acting chief of staff  they said  but it was unclear whether Mr. Trump saw it. Mr. Navarro is a well-established China hawk who has long been mistrustful of the country’s government and trade practices. Both Mr. Navarro and Matthew Pottinger  the chief deputy at the National Security Council  were among the few officials urging colleagues in January to take a harder line in relation to the growing threat of the coronavirus. But their warnings were seen by other officials as primarily reflecting their concerns about China’s behavior — and their concerns look more prescient in hindsight than they actually were  other officials argue. With the subject line “Impose Travel Ban on China?” Mr. Navarro opened the memo by writing  “If the probability of a pandemic is greater than roughly 1%  a game-theoretic analysis of the coronavirus indicates the clear dominant strategy is an immediate travel ban on China.” Mr. Navarro concluded at one point: “Regardless of whether the coronavirus proves to be a pandemic-level outbreak  there are certain costs associated with engaging in policies to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease. The most readily available option to contain the spread of the outbreak is to issue a travel ban to and from the source of the outbreak  namely  mainland China.” He suggested that under an “aggressive” containment scenario  a travel ban may need to last as long as 12 months for proper containment  a duration of time that at that point some White House aides saw as unsustainable. The travel limits subsequently imposed by Mr. Trump did not entirely ban travel from China  and many travelers from the country continued to stream into the United States. Mr. Navarro was at odds with medical experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  who had argued that such travel bans only delay the eventual spread. Mr. Navarro alluded to that debate on Saturday during a separate argument with Dr. Fauci in the Situation Room about whether the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was effective in treating or preventing the virus  according to two people familiar with the events. In the memo  Mr. Navarro cautioned that it was “unlikely the introduction of the coronavirus into the U.S. population in significant numbers will mimic a ‘seasonal flu’ event with relatively low contagion and mortality rates.” He noted the history of pandemic flus and suggested the chances were elevated for one after the new pathogen had developed in China. “This historical precedent alone should be sufficient to prove the need to take aggressive action to contain the outbreak ” he wrote  going on to say the early estimates of how easily the virus was spreading supported the possibility that the risks were even greater than the history of flu pandemics suggested. Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/us/politics/06dc-virus-trump1/merlin_171237021_fb149ca9-c446-4537-97e0-509a309120a6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge.png 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-testing-us.html, health, Despite Promises  Testing Delays Leave Americans ‘Flying Blind’, Even as new and faster tests become available  lengthy delays to obtain results continue and test materials are running low  compounding the crises hospitals are facing., Supported by Even as new and faster tests become available  lengthy delays to obtain results continue and test materials are running low  compounding the crises hospitals are facing. By Sheila Kaplan and Katie Thomas Three weeks ago  Dr. Elaine Cham  a pathologist at a large children’s hospital in California  had a sense that the nation’s coronavirus testing mess was finally getting under control. She could send tests to a lab at Stanford University Medical Center and get the results within a day. When backlogs grew at Stanford  Dr. Cham starting sending tests to Quest Diagnostics  a major laboratory company that has been ramping up its testing capacity. But the turnaround for results could be 13 days  she said  so her hospital switched to the University of California  San Francisco  for a two-to-three day wait. “We simply said  ‘This is ridiculous ’” said Dr. Cham  who works at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in Oakland. Testing availability remains a signature failure of the battle against the coronavirus in the United States  despite President Trump’s boast last week that he got a rapid test and results within minutes. And Vice President Mike Pence has repeatedly promised that Americans will be able to get tests at their doctors’ offices  although the timeline for routine access may be months away. More and more rapid tests are coming onto the market and private companies like Quest and LabCorp are now running thousands of tests a day. But as the virus has spread from state to state infecting hundreds of thousands of Americans  demand for testing has overwhelmed many labs and testing sites. Doctors and officials around the country say that lengthy delays in getting results have persisted and that continued uneven access to tests has prolonged rationing and hampered patient care. In addition  swabs and chemicals needed to run the tests are in short supply in many of the nation’s hot zones. “Many local communities are flying blind  making decisions in the absence of full information largely due to the failure of the federal government to provide sufficient testing capacity ” said Chrissie Juliano  executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition  which represents executives in 30 urban public health departments  among them Boston  Chicago  Los Angeles  New York City and Seattle. “This testing shortage  and lack of available information about the actual burden of the virus  has set our country’s response back by an order of magnitude we will never know.” At least 305 000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus  although many public health experts say the actual number is much higher. More than 9 400 people have died. On Monday  President Trump said that the number of coronavirus tests in the United States now exceeds that in other countries  seeming to suggest that the country is doing a better job of monitoring the spread of the disease than those countries. But his statement  during the daily the White House briefing  overlooked the fact that the United States has a much larger population than countries like South Korea  which has been extensively testing its residents. On a per capita basis  the United States had tested far fewer people than several other countries. South Korea has tested thousands more people for every million residents compared to the United States  according to its government website as well as the Covid Tracking Project  which tracks testing in the United States. According to the project  1.9 million people had been tested in the United States as of Monday. Adm. Brett P. Giroir  the assistant secretary of health who is overseeing the government’s testing response  said quick-response tests are being shipped around the country  and that the government is working closely with hospitals and other laboratories to ensure they have what they need. “I think testing is really in a good position right now ” he said. Federal inquiries have begun to determine how the nation’s testing capacity turned into such a debacle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had manufacturing errors with the first test it devised for public health labs around the country  and so testing in the states stalled as the virus began to spread in Washington State  New York and California. The Food and Drug Administration  charged with approving the test  was so frustrated that the agency pushed for the C.D.C. to stop making it on site and instead send it to Integrated DNA Technologies  an outside lab. The F.D.A.  for its part  was slow to recognize the danger of the pandemic  and how critical testing by commercial labs and hospitals would be as the virus spread. In early March  the nation’s two largest commercial labs  Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp  started testing  and they have acknowledged that their labs around the country were overwhelmed. Quest’s backlog is 80 000  according to the company  down from 160 000 on March 25. LabCorp says it has caught up  and now has a turnaround of four to five days from pickup. Supplies of test swabs have gotten so low that most hospitals test only their most vulnerable patients  typically those being admitted. Wendy Bost  a spokeswoman for Quest  which introduced its coronavirus tests on March 9  said the company had ramped up its testing and could now process more than 35 000 tests per day — over 200 000 each week — at its 12 labs around the country. Last week  Quest asked hospitals to identify health care workers and symptomatic patients for priority processing and she said the company was providing results now on an average of a day for that population. To date  Quest has processed nearly 550 000 coronavirus tests  Ms. Bost said. The current turnaround time for other patients  she said  is now two to three days although she acknowledged there was a longer wait in the areas most affected  like Chicago  New York  New Jersey and Miami. LabCorp has four labs running  also averaging about 35 000 to 40 000 coronavirus tests each day  the company said. Mike Geller  a LabCorp spokesman  said it had tested about 500 000 samples  and that the time for processing varied  based on demand. “LabCorp  along with other laboratories  is experiencing unprecedented and rapidly increasing demand for Covid-19 testing in the midst of this national health emergency ” Mr. Geller said. The latest test approvals by the F.D.A. include one by Abbott Laboratories  called ID Now  which can provide results in a few minutes; and others  like Roche and Hologic  which perform automated  high-volume testing in commercial and hospital labs. These tests work by finding fragments of genetic material from the virus to indicate a current infection. But these tests will take weeks  if not months  to be manufactured on a scale that can be widely shipped to most institutions. For many hospitals  however  the cost of the instruments needed to run those tests will be prohibitive. And even the nation’s top hospitals have reported that they are very low on the materials needed to run the tests. Darcy Ross  a spokeswoman for Abbott  said the company had shipped its new  fast-turnaround test to 18 states  including those with the highest number of infections like New York  New Jersey  Michigan and California. In addition  the federal government is buying the Abbott test instruments for state public labs. Mia Heck  a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services  said it was sending 15 machines each to public health labs in all 50 states and the Pacific islands  and 250 to the Indian Health Service. Alaska will get 50. Twenty will go to the C.D.C. and 50 to the Strategic National Stockpile. Ms. Heck said the department had purchased 30 000 test cartridges  to be used in the ID Now devices  to leave a sufficient supply for private hospitals and clinics. As of Friday  Abbott had already shipped 190 000 test cartridges  and planned to produce 50 000 more each day. On Monday  CVS Health announced it would open drive-through test sites  using the ID Now test  in Georgia and Rhode Island. The University of California  San Francisco announced on Monday that it would provide free Covid-19 testing for the next 30 days to health departments in nine surrounding Northern California counties. UCSF built out an empty biopharmaceutical space near downtown  using $5 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  after the federal and state governments loosened regulations on where testing labs could be built and who could staff them. At UC Davis Health in Sacramento  Dr. David Lubarsky  the health system’s chief executive  said the health system had a large testing instrument from Roche that could run more than 1 000 tests a day  but the company had been sending enough supplies to run only a few hundred tests per day. “Every single person should be tested who presents with symptoms that suggests they have Covid-19 ” Dr. Lubarsky said. “But the reason we are not suggesting that is the lack of available test kits.” Dr. Lubarsky said UC Davis was working on developing new tests that could be run on the Roche machine  which he said were expected to be approved in a couple of weeks. Michael Weist  a spokesman for Roche  said the demand for materials needed to run its three-and-a-half-hour test was outpacing the supply. There are now 60 sites that have it. “It’s a difficult decision because everybody wants to run the test ” he said. At another hospital in California  an emergency room doctor  who asked not to be named for fear of losing her job  said she had to send home a patient who most likely had a bad case of Covid-19. The hospital has so few test swabs that doctors are permitted to use them only for patients who are admitted  who are over 65 with diabetes or other medical problems  or who are pregnant. Reluctantly  the doctor sent her home  with a face mask and instructions on hand-washing  which can provide only limited protection in her tight  multifamily living quarters. The long wait time for hospitals to obtain coronavirus test results can cripple a hospital  said Dr. Steven Choi  the chief quality officer and associate dean at Yale New Haven Health System and Yale University School of Medicine. “Number one  you don’t know what kind of disease or illness you are dealing with in a severely sick patent ” he said  “and until you know if they are positive or negative  you are going to be using potentially unnecessary personal protective equipment  which is already at a shortage. The people who come into your room use face shields  goggles  mask and gloves — and it could it turn out you have a cold.” Dr. Julio E. Figueroa  chief of infectious diseases at Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans  said drive-through and tent-testing sites had helped ease a backlog. Dr. Figueroa said his hospital was sending fewer to LabCorp  which he said had an average return of four to five days. Instead  they are relying on the Roche diagnostic test  which they can do in-house. But  like Dr. Lubarsky in Sacramento  he lacks sufficient supplies to do as many of the tests as he would like. “That’s another bottleneck in terms of testing ” Dr. Figueroa said. Most of the current tests use a sample taken with a nasal swab. The swab is pushed through the nose to the spot where it meets the throat  and a sample is taken. Some doctors favor an alternative sampling method  using a nasal wash  which flushes saline into the nose and then collects it coming out of the nostrils. Dr. David Persing  executive vice president of Cepheid  which received F.D.A. authorization for a coronavirus test that analyzes samples in about 45 minutes  said its test could work with samples taken by swab or nasal wash. “For an emergency room that has run out of swabs  that would be a good option ” he said. Margot Sanger-Katz and Matt Richtel contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/science/03VIRUS-DELAYS3/03VIRUS-DELAYS3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-schools-attendance-absent.html, us, As School Moves Online  Many Students Stay Logged Out, , Teachers at some schools across the country report that fewer than half of their students are participating in online learning. Daniel Gonzalez Rosas  17  outside of his shuttered school  the Maywood Center for Enriched Studies in Los Angeles County. Daniel said that only about half of his classmates join video conference calls for class. “Most are under the impression that school is optional given the circumstances we are in ” he said.Credit...David Walter Banks for The New York Times Supported by By Dana Goldstein  Adam Popescu and Nikole Hannah-Jones Chronic absenteeism is a problem in American education during the best of times  but now  with the vast majority of the nation’s school buildings closed and lessons being conducted remotely  more students than ever are missing class — not logging on  not checking in or not completing assignments. The absence rate appears particularly high in schools with many low-income students  whose access to home computers and internet connections can be spotty. Some teachers report that fewer than half of their students are regularly participating. The trend is leading to widespread concern among educators  with talk of a potential need for summer sessions  an early start in the fall  or perhaps having some or even all students repeat a grade once Americans are able to return to classrooms. Students are struggling to connect in districts large and small. Los Angeles said last week that about a third of its high school students were not logging in for classes. And there are daunting challenges for rural communities like Minford  Ohio  where many students live in remote wooded areas unserved by internet providers. Educators say that some students and their parents have dropped out of touch with schools completely — unavailable by phone  email or any other form of communication — as families struggle with the broader economic and health effects of the coronavirus outbreak. Even before the outbreak  chronic absenteeism was a problem in many schools  especially those with a lot of low-income students. Many obstacles can prevent children who live in poverty from making it to class: a parent’s broken-down car or a teenager’s need to babysit siblings  for example. But online learning presents new obstacles  particularly with uneven levels of technology and adult supervision. Titilayo Aluko  18  a junior at Landmark High School in Manhattan  is one of the students trying hard to keep up with her classes who has been thwarted by her lack of access to technology. She has a district-issued laptop  but no Wi-Fi network in her Bronx apartment since her family had trouble paying the monthly bill. For classes like statistics and neuroscience  Ms. Aluko has tried to complete assignments and participate in video conferences using her cellphone  but that is sometimes impossible. “I actually need my teachers  who know me and understand me  to help me  and I don’t have that ” she said. “I just keep thinking  ‘Oh  my God  I might not pass.’ I’m just really scared for the future.” Cratering attendance in some districts contrasts with reports from several selective or affluent schools where close to 100 percent of students are participating in online learning. The dramatic split promises to further deepen the typical academic achievement gaps between poor  middle-class and wealthy students. The scale of the challenge  and the work that will need to be done to catch children up academically and socially  is “huge ” said Michael Casserly  executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools  a network of urban education systems. He called the prospect of “unfinished learning” from this time “a serious issue that could have implications for years.” There is no precedent in educators’ memories for what is happening right now. Schools have weathered disruptive events like Hurricane Katrina and the California wildfires  but those disasters were limited to shorter time periods and smaller regions. During the coronavirus pandemic  every state in the country has ordered or recommended closing schools  in many cases through the end of the academic year. School leaders across the country are already debating how to help students catch up. To maintain social distancing  some regions may bring children back to school in waves  in order to reduce the number of people inside classrooms and buildings at any given time. There is also concern about whether large numbers of students will need to repeat all or substantial portions of their current grade. “Many skills build one on another ” Mr. Casserly said. “If a child misses out on some key idea  then all of a sudden  additional ideas as they’re introduced just become Greek. Will we need some kind of beginning of the year diagnostics to try and figure out just where the kids are  how much they have lost?” For many students  it seems most likely that the answer will be: Yes  quite a lot. In the Cleveland Metropolitan School District last week  teachers returning from an extended spring break tried to hold virtual parent-teacher conferences for the first time for all of the district’s 38 000 students. Initially  they were able to reach only 60 percent of families  but after a few more days of trying  the number reached 87 percent  said Eric S. Gordon  the district’s chief executive. The city of Cleveland has one of the nation’s highest child-poverty rates. Despite the economic slowdown  many parents continue to work full-time outside their homes in fields like sanitation  health and food service  meaning that many students do not have an adult at home to supervise their learning. Mr. Gordon estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the district’s students also do not have reliable access to the internet at home. So in addition to developing plans for online learning  the district has distributed printed work packets along with free meals  and will soon begin mailing those packets to students’ home addresses. Tracy Radich  a fourth-grade teacher at the Joseph M. Gallagher School in Cleveland  spent Tuesday and Wednesday going down her roster of 20 students  trying to call each student’s parents and make individual plans to help each of them learn from home. Some of her students’ families speak Somali  Swahili or Spanish  so she asked colleagues who speak those languages to help. So far  only three of her students have been consistently engaged with online lessons  she said. About six do not have regular access to the internet. One boy typically goes to the library to get online  but the city’s libraries are now closed  too. She expects to interact with several students mostly through phone calls. “We are going to come together and meet everybody where they are ” Ms. Radich said. School funding is typically tied to student enrollment or attendance counts across the country  but Ohio has unlinked funding from those counts  a policy that education experts expect most states to adopt in the coming weeks. In rural Minford  a town of about 700 in southern Ohio near the border with Kentucky  the district is distributing laptops as well as work packets on paper to students without internet or technology access  estimated at 25 to 30 percent of the student body by the district’s superintendent. Regardless of whether Minford’s students can participate in online classes or turn in work  administrators expect to promote a majority of them to the next grade  said Marin Applegate  the district’s school psychologist. “We do not feel they are in control and cannot be held accountable ” she said. Some school systems  like the District of Columbia Public Schools  have stopped taking formal attendance altogether. The nation’s largest school district  New York City  which is at the center of the coronavirus crisis  has not yet released data on the number of children participating in online learning. The district said it would officially begin tracking remote attendance on Monday. In Los Angeles  the nation’s second-largest school district  about 13 percent of high school students have had no online contact with teachers since schools closed three weeks ago  and one-third are not regularly participating in online learning  according to the superintendent  Austin Beutner. Heber Marquez  a high school English teacher at the Maywood Center for Enriched Studies in Los Angeles County  estimated that just 45 percent of his students were showing up to Zoom classroom meetings. “A lot of our students have siblings they have to take care of  and their parents are still going out and working ” Mr. Marquez said. “It makes it very difficult to log on at the same time as feeding breakfast to their siblings or helping with chores.” Many schools are making efforts to distribute digital devices to students who do not have their own at home. Los Angeles is trying to get them to more than 100 000 students  Mr. Beutner said. The Miami-Dade County Public Schools have distributed more than 80 000 mobile devices for distance learning  and more than 11 000 smartphones to serve as home Wi-Fi hot spots  according to a spokeswoman. In New York  the city’s typical inequalities are reflected in the wide range of participation levels in remote learning. At Brooklyn Technical High School  one of the city’s most competitive  Serge Avery  a social studies teacher  said 98 percent of his students have been participating in daily online activities  like reading and responding to a Financial Times article about the coronavirus. His freshman global history students are currently studying the Middle Ages  and he has considered doing a unit on the bubonic plague. But he thought twice after receiving a heartfelt email from a student  written at 4 a.m.  in which she described her mother being taken away by ambulance with Covid-19 symptoms. Mr. Avery said he worried that even among his high-achieving students  participation could drop off as online learning becomes more of a daily grind for restless teenagers. “Teachers really get energized by the classroom ” he said. The current limitations  he added  have left both teachers and students “slightly depressed.” Dan Levin and Audra D.S. Burch contributed reporting.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/australia/cardinal-george-pell-conviction.html, world australia, George Pell Freed After Australian Court Overturns Sex Abuse Conviction, The cardinal was the highest-ranking Roman Catholic leader ever found guilty of sexually abusing children., Supported by The cardinal was the highest-ranking Roman Catholic leader ever found guilty of sexually abusing children. By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Damien Cave MELBOURNE  Australia — Australia’s highest court on Tuesday overturned the sexual abuse conviction of Cardinal George Pell  the highest-ranking Roman Catholic leader ever found guilty in the church’s clergy pedophilia crisis. Cardinal Pell  78  who was the Vatican’s chief financial officer and an adviser to Pope Francis  was sentenced to six years in prison last March for molesting two 13-year-old boys after Sunday Mass in 1996. He walked free on Tuesday after a panel of seven judges ruled that the jury ought to have entertained a doubt about his guilt. The judges cited “compounding improbabilities” to conclude that the verdicts on five counts reached in 2018 were “unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.” In a statement  Cardinal Pell reiterated his assertion that he had committed no crimes. “I have consistently maintained my innocence while suffering from a serious injustice ” he said. “This has been remedied today with the High Court’s unanimous decision.” The verdict  handed down by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel to a largely empty courtroom in Brisbane because of social distancing measures to help slow the spread of the coronavirus  shocked Catholics in Australia and around the world. Cardinal Pell had receded from the public mind during his time in prison  and with the exception of his die-hard supporters  most Australians had come to accept his guilt as an established fact. His case had dragged on for years. His first trial ended with a hung jury; his second carried on with a heavy shroud of secrecy as suppression orders limited what could be reported or even scrutinized. The testimony of the case’s most important witness  a former choirboy who had stepped forward with his claims in 2015  was never made public  not even in transcripts. Legal experts said that made it difficult for the public to comprehend the complexity of the case  as well as the High Court’s ultimate ruling. “Most of us didn’t know any of the details  and none of us have seen the complainant’s testimony ” said Jeremy Gans  a Melbourne Law School professor who has been closely following the case. The cardinal had been convicted on counts related to two separate incidents when he was the archbishop of Melbourne  making him the first bishop to be found guilty in a criminal court for sexually abusing minors  according to BishopAccountability.org  which tracks cases of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. The six-year sentence  which fell far short of the 50-year maximum  was closely scrutinized  but held up on its initial appeal  which was based in part on Cardinal Pell’s contention that there was not sufficient evidence to support the convictions. In its judgment on Tuesday  the High Court found that for all five charges  there were many improbabilities that had not been fully considered by the jury. There is “a significant possibility ” the judges wrote in summarizing the case  “that an innocent person has been convicted.” The problems started  the decision suggested  with the single accuser. Because a second complainant had died before a trial began  the case was “wholly dependent upon the acceptance of the truthfulness and the reliability” of one man’s testimony  the judges wrote. While the jury found him credible  along with a majority of judges in the Court of Appeal  the High Court sided with a dissenting appeals court judge. That judge said that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about Cardinal Pell’s guilt based on testimony from other witnesses who argued that the events described by the accuser did not match the cardinal’s regular Sunday routine. There were other allegations that were not part of the case. In February 2019  a second trial in which Cardinal Pell was accused of touching boys in a swimming pool in Ballarat was canceled because of legal setbacks. Karen Monument  the sister of one of the men in that case  said her brother and the family were “devastated” that Cardinal Pell would now walk free. “We sincerely hope that today’s decision by the court of Australia does not become a deterrent to survivor victims. It is more important than ever that they continue to speak their truth and hold to account both perpetrators and institutions ” the Monument family said in a statement released via Facebook. Phil Nagle  an advocate for abuse victims from Ballarat  Cardinal Pell’s hometown  said that he and others were shocked by the judgment  which engendered further distrust of a court system that they feel has failed to bring many abusers to justice. We “don’t know what to believe anymore ” Mr. Nagle said  adding that he remained hopeful that further allegations against Cardinal Pell would come to light  and that he ultimately would be brought to trial again. “The journey is a long way from being over for Cardinal Pell ” he said. Last week  two other men came forward accusing Cardinal Pell of abusing them in Ballarat during his time as a priest in that diocese. Rosemary O’Grady  a retired lawyer who took detailed notes at the trials on behalf of several victims’ groups  said that the judgment showed the need for abuse survivors to have their own representation in the courtroom. “The crown case was so abysmal ” Ms. O’Grady said of the prosecution’s case. “There were times when I was walking up and down with steam coming out my nostrils ” she said  adding that the release of Cardinal Pell represented “a bad day for democracy.” Livia Albeck-Ripka reported from Melbourne  Australia  and Damien Cave from Sydney.

It’s Getting More Widespread., New data shows example after example of overheating and damage along the 1 500-mile natural wonder., Supported by New data shows example after example of overheating and damage along the 1 500-mile natural wonder. By Damien Cave SYDNEY  Australia — When Terry Hughes surveyed the Great Barrier Reef four years ago from a small plane  mapping the bleaching and death of corals from water warmed by climate change  he hoped such a rare and heartbreaking scene would not be repeated anytime soon. But rising temperatures sent him back to the air in 2017  when the reef bleached again. Then he returned last month  leading to another devastating conclusion: The reef was being ravaged by bleaching yet again  this time across an even wider area. “It’s the first time we’ve seen severely bleached reefs along the whole length of the reef  in particular  the coastal reefs ” said Professor Hughes  the director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. “Those are bleached everywhere.” New aerial data from Professor Hughes and other scientists released on Monday shows example after example of overheating and damage along the reef  a 1 500-mile natural wonder. The survey amounts to an updated X-ray for a dying patient  with the markers of illness being the telltale white of coral that has lost its color  visible from the air and in the water. The mass bleaching indicates that corals are under intense stress from the waters around them  which have been growing increasingly hotter. The world’s oceans  which absorb 93 percent of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases that humans send into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels  are warming up 40 percent faster on average than scientists estimated six years ago. According to one recent study  2019 was the hottest year on record for the world’s oceans. For corals  the stress from these ever-warming waters usually leads to death. In the past  they might have recovered after the water cooled  a process that could take 10 to 15 years. Now  though  a wide range of species of coral reefs all over the world are experiencing mass die-offs. Roughly 30 percent of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef died after the 2016 bleaching  which was the worst of five separate bleaching events since 1998. This year’s bleaching — which was documented by surveying 1 036 sections of the reef — appears to rank second only to 2016  according to Professor Hughes. “We’re surprised by the pace of this acceleration in bleaching ” he said. “We had a 14-year gap between 2002 and 2016  and now in five years we’ve had three severe events.” The Great Barrier Reef is not entirely dead — it is large enough to support swaths of healthy coral. But in many areas of the reef  for miles and miles  corals that were once colorful are now white  brittle and broken  or gray and covered with unsightly bacteria. They’re sensitive creatures. Corals are tiny polyps that gather algae that convert sunlight into food  forming colorful colonies that build a limestone structure — a reef — on which to live. They thrive in warm water  but only up to a point: Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can kill the tiny creatures. Temperatures in February  during the Southern Hemisphere summer  were far above that. It was the warmest month on record for water temperatures near the reef  with readings in some places peaking at more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average for the time of year. Professor Hughes said the heat waves of recent years were creating a cumulative effect that was drastically altering the makeup of the reef. The species most likely to bleach and die are staghorn coral and other root and branch corals with spaces that allow many kinds of fish to swim and gain protection. The species that seem hearty enough to survive tend to be dome-like corals  known as brain corals  which play a role in protecting against coastal erosion but are less valuable to fish and other wildlife. “This is a transition from high diversity and lots of species  to lower diversity  with fewer tougher species ” Professor Hughes said. The ripple effect could be significant. Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish like the coral trout  which is already being affected by the bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. Many scientists worry that the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis. In the meantime  scientists who were conducting research in March before the coronavirus outbreak forced lockdowns said they had been saddened and frustrated by what they witnessed at sea. Tracy Ainsworth  a marine biologist at the University of New South Wales  was working with a team on Heron Island  in the southern section of the Great Barrier Reef that bleached this year for the first time. The corals started to show signs of stress in January  she said  around the same time that Australia’s bush-fire crisis reached its apex. After a stretch of cooler weather in February  the overheating continued from late February through March  with scientists finding dead corals in shallow reef habitats  and bleaching in deeper reef slopes that were believed to be better protected. It was in many ways what Professor Ainsworth expected. “It’s frustrating to still see reports of bleaching as a surprise ” she said. She noted that scientists had warned 20 years ago that coral reefs would be at risk if humans did not address climate change  adding that many people who lived near them believed the science back then and are now demanding to know why more isn’t being done. “We are going to keep reporting decline and recording change on reefs and telling people what they already know about how corals die ” Professor Ainsworth said. “Isn’t it time we started telling them something more than that?” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/06oz-reef/merlin_171319851_306324e6-3364-46c7-bae4-413df1df9af7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-damien-cave/author-damien-cave-thumbLarge.png

A busy street market in Georgetown  Guyana  in March.Credit...Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times Supported by By Anatoly Kurmanaev GEORGETOWN  Guyana — On a sprawling abandoned sugar estate by the coast of Guyana  the scale of the changes sweeping across the country is immediately visible. In just a few years  enormous warehouses and office buildings servicing international oil companies have sprung up amid the shrub land  irrigation canals and fields of wild cane. People are “moving from cutting cane to businessmen ” said Mona Harisha  a local shop owner. “It changed so fast.” Guyana is giving up its past as an agricultural economy and speeding toward its near-term future as an oil-producing giant. And so Ms. Harisha has renovated her general goods shop  redolent of Indian spices  which she runs from a side of her cottage in the Houston neighborhood of Georgetown  the county’s capital. 200 miles VENEZUELA Atlantic Ocean Georgetown Skeldon GUYANA FRENCH GUIANA SURINAME BRAZIL Atlantic Ocean 1 mile vlissengen rd. Georgetown Demerara River guyana houston Street data from OpenStreetMap E. Bank public rd. By The New York Times She said oil companies have brought jobs and better roads  and have raised home values — and brought new business to her shop. Her daughter is thinking of returning from New York  an example of how the government is enticing Guyana’s huge diaspora home with promises of the oil bounty. For many  the transformation into an oil economy has brought optimism about greater prosperity. But that optimism is often mixed with a fatalism that nothing will really improve for the vast majority of people in one of South America’s poorest countries. Once home to 3 000 sugar workers  the abandoned Houston sugar estate has gradually been absorbed into the suburban sprawl of Georgetown. About 100 families still live in the uniform one-story cottages built by the state sugar company for workers in the 1960s. For them  the recent changes have brought opportunity. Like most of Houston’s residents  Ms. Harisha’s ancestors came to Guyana as indentured laborers from India in the late 19th century to replace enslaved Africans on the sugar plantations after the British  who then ruled Guyana as a colony  abolished the slave trade. When the Indian laborers’ contracts expired  some stayed  becoming Guyana’s largest ethnic group and helping shape a unique  vibrant culture  which looks outward to the Caribbean rather than to its Latin American neighbors. While the effects of the giant oil discoveries off Guyana’s coast are most obvious in and around Georgetown  they are now beginning to extend a little farther beyond the capital  too. In a brick shack on the edge of the jungle 15 miles away from Houston  Jason Bobb-Semple  25  is making his own big bet on oil. With a $3 000 government loan  he built a small poultry farm and bought 4 000 chicks to meet what he expects to be a booming food demand in a rapidly developing country. “After all this oil ” said Mr. Bobb-Semple  people will want to eat. “These are my hopes.” Just hours after Mr. Bobb-Semple received the chicks  he got a visit from his first potential investor  a Guyanese émigré businessman who was back home looking for eggs to sell to the offshore oil rigs. The investor  Lancelot Myers  said oil companies currently have to import most of their provisions  providing a business opportunity to local entrepreneurs who can fill supply gaps. “Now is the time to hit the ground running ” he said. The enterprising energy of the Guyanese seeking to benefit from the oil boom contrasts sharply with the deep depression  both economic and psychological  reining in the rural sugar belt  which had powered this country’s economy since the 17th century. A decision by the current president  David A. Granger  to shut down most of Guyana’s unprofitable  state-owned cane processing plants in 2018 left about 7 000 sugar workers unemployed  devastating the surrounding regions. The closures have turned places like Skeldon in the fertile east of the country into ghost towns  wiping out the once vibrant local markets and businesses that used to serve the sugar workers. Bands of former cane cutters aimlessly roam Skeldon’s streets or pass the time in fast-food shops without eating  despairing of finding another job. “This country was created out of sugar. I lived my life in that industry ” said Ferdinand Guptar  a 59-year-old unemployed cane cutter in Skeldon  who now does household chores for his wife while she cleans the floors at a school for $200 a month. “It’s depressing when your wife has to take care of you ” he said. The layoffs inflamed ethnic tensions  with the mainly Indo-Guyanese sugar workers accusing the predominantly black government of Mr. Granger of targeted economic repression. According to the latest census  ethnic Indians comprise 40 percent of Guyana’s population of about 750 000  compared with 30 percent for the Afro-Guyanese. The Indigenous communities  about 10 percent of the population  provide the country’s traditional swing vote. “Sometimes it’s not just about profitability  but the quality of people’s lives ” said David Armogan  the governor of Skeldon’s region  referring to his opposition to the sugar plant closures. “This is more about vindictiveness  than economics.” These ethnic tensions reached a fever pitch during the March 2 elections  whose aftermath has descended into a bitter  inconclusive contest between Mr. Granger and the main opposition party backed primarily by ethnic Indians. The outcome remains undecided  and the country is still at a political standoff. The financial stakes of the political conflict are enormous  as oil revenues are expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue into government coffers in the years ahead. The election was largely a referendum on how Guyana should spend that windfall. The ruling party advocates using the money to retrain agricultural workers for the public and service sectors. The opposition instead wants to subsidize sugar farms to keep rural communities alive. The first  small-scale oil exports started in January  and while the money that the government will see in 2020 will just be a fraction of what’s coming when output reaches 1.2 million barrels day at the end of this decade  one-third of the state’s budget this year still is expected to come from oil revenue. The International Monetary Fund projected that Guyana’s tiny economy would grow by 86 percent this year  the fastest rate in the world. That forecast  however  is likely to take a major hit from the sudden collapse of oil prices  the coronavirus pandemic and Guyana’s ongoing political paralysis. To Guyana’s small  but vocal group of environmentalists  the country’s polarized politics and ethnic grievances distract from its existential problems as it becomes a major contributor to fossil fuel consumption. Along the country’s densely populated central coast  rising sea levels brought on by climate change are gradually overwhelming a system of dikes first built hundreds of years ago by the Dutch colonialists who preceded the British. Nine out of 10 people in Guyana live below or near sea level. Each day for the past five months  a road gang has toiled on a Sisyphean task along the muddy Atlantic Coast  trying to fill a breach in a 60-mile sea wall with stones and sand. Each week  the tide washes away their efforts. “It keeps getting worse  until you can’t control it ” said Joree Shoturem  an ex-farmer in the village of Broom Hall near Georgetown whose rice fields were ruined by the creeping salt water and whose sheep and cows were swept away. “The repairs have had no good result.” Despite the futility  Mr. Shoturem has resigned himself to his new government job. With no farm  he has joined the work crew  ceaselessly lobbing piles of dirt into an advancing ocean. “People don’t make the connection between the rising tides and the fossil fuel ” said Annette Arjoon  a local businesswoman and environmentalist. “Unless we have a real national conversation  we’ll use the oil revenues to build higher sea walls.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/06guyana-dispatch/merlin_170928630_f74cf8ec-d8e0-415d-a4f5-96f5a49cd529-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale  https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/06guyana-dispatch-02/merlin_170928378_bace2007-f982-4016-9501-0efafe858aca-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/supreme-court-traffic-stops-age-bias.html, us, Supreme Court Rules on Traffic Stops and Age Bias, The court also turned down an appeal on whether transit systems may reject religious advertising., Supported by The court also turned down an appeal on whether transit systems may reject religious advertising. By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that police officers may stop vehicles registered to people whose driver’s licenses had been suspended on the assumption that the driver was the owner  rather than  say  a family member. The court also ruled that federal workers can win age discrimination suits under a more relaxed standard than employees in the private sector. And it turned down an appeal challenging a transit system’s ban on religious advertising. In spring 2016  a sheriff’s deputy in Lawrence  Kan.  ran a check of the license plate of a moving Chevrolet pickup truck. The deputy learned that the vehicle was registered to Charles Glover Jr. and that Mr. Glover’s driver’s license had been revoked. Based on that information and nothing more  the deputy stopped the truck  which Mr. Glover turned out to be driving. Mr. Glover was prosecuted for driving without a license  and he moved to suppress the evidence against him  arguing that the stop had violated the Fourth Amendment  which forbids unreasonable searches and seizures. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled for Mr. Glover  saying the deputy had made two unreasonable assumptions: that a vehicle’s registered owner is “likely the primary driver” and that people whose driver’s licenses are suspended or revoked “will likely disregard the suspension or revocation and continue to drive.” The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday reversed that ruling  saying that the deputy’s assumption had been supported by common sense. Justice Clarence Thomas  writing for the majority  said the deputy had drawn “an entirely reasonable inference that Glover was driving while his license was revoked.” Justice Thomas wrote that matters would be different had the officer known  for instance  that the registered owner was “in his mid-60s” but observed that the driver was “in her mid-20s.” In a concurring opinion  Justice Elena Kagan  joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  gave several other examples of kinds of information available to police officers that would make such traffic stops improper. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented in the case  Kansas v. Glover  No. 18-556. “The majority today has paved the road to finding reasonable suspicion based on nothing more than a demographic profile ” she wrote. The second decision issued Monday  Babb v. Wilkie  No. 18-882  concerned Noris Babb  a pharmacist who said she was denied promotions  benefits and training opportunities by the Department of Veterans Affairs at least partly because of her age. Had she worked in the private sector or for a state or local government  she would have had to prove that her age was a determinative reason for the denials — a “but for” cause in the legal jargon. The question for the justices was whether federal workers can win age discrimination suits under a more relaxed standard  showing only that age was one factor among many leading to a negative employment decision. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.  writing for the majority  said the words of the relevant law allowed Ms. Babb to sue under the relaxed standard. The law says that “all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age” shall be “made free from any discrimination based on age.” “That Congress would want to hold the federal government to a higher standard than state and private employers is not unusual ” Justice Alito wrote. He added  though  that even federal workers must satisfy the stricter standard to obtain many forms of relief  including reinstatement and back pay. Only Justice Thomas dissented. “The court’s holding ” he wrote  “unnecessarily risks imposing hardship on those tasked with managing thousands of employees within our numerous federal agencies.” The court also turned down an appeal from the Archdiocese of Washington  whose request to place religious advertising on public buses during the 2017 Christmas season was rejected by the local transit system. The ad showed the silhouettes of three shepherds looking at a star along with the words “Find the Perfect Gift.” A web address on the ad led to information about Roman Catholic beliefs and activities. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  operated by Maryland  Virginia and the District of Columbia  rejected the ad  citing a 2015 policy barring political  religious and advocacy advertising. The agency said it had adopted the policy after it received complaints about ads showing graphic images of animal cruelty  opposing discrimination based on sexual orientation and criticizing the Catholic Church’s position on using condoms. The archdiocese sued  saying the policy violated the First Amendment’s prohibition of government discrimination against speech based on its viewpoint. A trial judge ruled for the agency  and a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh  then a judge on the appeals court  was the third member of the panel and heard arguments in the case. Though he did not participate in the appeals court’s decision  he disqualified himself from the Supreme Court’s consideration of the case  Archdiocese of Washington v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  No. 18-1455. “Because the full court is unable to hear this case  it makes a poor candidate for our review ” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch  joined by Justice Thomas  said in a statement. But they said the transit system had engaged in viewpoint discrimination forbidden by the First Amendment. “The First Amendment requires governments to protect religious viewpoints  not single them out for silencing ” Justice Gorsuch wrote. In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case  the archdiocese argued that the agency had plainly discriminated against religious viewpoints. “If Amazon or Macy’s had wanted to run an advertisement with the same text and graphics or with reindeer instead of shepherds  there is no question that W.M.A.T.A. would have readily accepted the advertisement ” Paul D. Clement  a former solicitor general in the Bush administration  wrote in a petition seeking review. The agency  represented by Donald B. Verrilli Jr.  a former solicitor general in the Obama administration  responded that the archdiocese’s argument “depends on treating advertisements for toys or beverages not as what they are — efforts to sell commercial products — but as a form of social commentary on the meaning of Christmas.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/us/politics/06dc-scotus/merlin_170953725_e3bba9a5-18dc-4fdf-bc77-fe4e9f844b89-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v3.png

To Billy Martin  he was Mr. Perfection., Supported by One of baseball’s finest hitters  he was also one of its best defensive outfielders  playing 22 seasons in Detroit. To Billy Martin  he was Mr. Perfection. By Richard Goldstein Al Kaline  one of baseball’s finest hitters and defensive outfielders whose Hall of Fame career spanned 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers  died on Monday at his home in Bloomfield Hills  Mich. He was 85. His son Mark confirmed the death. No specific cause was given. Kaline lacked the charisma of a Mickey Mantle or a Willie Mays  and he played on only one World Series championship team  but he was among baseball’s premier figures of his era. He became the youngest batting champion in major league history in 1955 when he hit .340 at age 20. He had 3 007 career hits  the 12th player to reach the No. 3 000 milestone  and he hit 399 home runs  a Tiger record. Renowned for his powerful arm  Kaline won 10 Gold Glove awards for his play in right field and sometimes in center. He set an American League record for outfielders by playing in 242 consecutive games without an error. He played in 2 834 games from 1953 to 1974  the most of any Tiger  and only Ty Cobb equaled his 22 years with the team. Kaline was a perennial All-Star  and in 1980 he became the 10th player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Billy Martin  his manager late in his career  referred to Kaline as Mr. Perfection  but his achievements came in the face of twin obstacles. He encountered the pressure of comparisons with Cobb  one of baseball’s greatest players  and he had been hampered since childhood by the bone disease osteomyelitis. “When you talk about all-around ballplayers  I’d say Kaline is the best I ever played against ” the Baltimore Orioles’ Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson told United Press International in September 1974 as Kaline approached his career’s final days. Albert William Kaline was born on Dec. 19  1934  into a working-class family in Baltimore that was determined to see him become a major league ballplayer. His father  Nicholas  two uncles and a grandfather had been semipro catchers on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “Even though my family could have used the money I might have made at odd jobs  my father would never let me earn a dime ” Kaline once told The Detroit News. “I never had to take a paper route or work in a drugstore or anything. I just played ball.” When Kaline was 8 years old  doctors removed two inches of bone from his left foot to ease his osteomyelitis  leaving scars  a deformity and discomfort when he took the field. But that didn’t deter the young Kaline  who sometimes played for five teams at the same time in Baltimore. “I’d play a game in one end of town  then my father or uncle would drive me to another game ” he recalled. “I would change uniforms in the car on the way. Sometimes I’d play three games in a day. I never got enough.” Kaline signed with the Tigers in June 1953  a few days after graduating from Southern High School in Baltimore  where he batted over .400 in three of his four seasons. He never spent a day in the minor leagues. He was soon a fixture in Detroit  sometimes known simply as Six  for his number. At 6 feet 2 inches and a trim 180 pounds  he lacked the classic mold of many a power hitter. But he squeezed rubber balls to strengthen his hands and relied on superb timing and his study of pitchers out of his right-handed stance. He hit .300 or better seven times between 1955 and 1963. Kaline finally reached the World Series in 1968  when the Tigers played the St. Louis Cardinals. He had broken an arm when he was hit by a pitch in late May  sidelining him for six weeks  and Jim Northrup had replaced him in right field. But Kaline got his batting form back late in the season  and Manager Mayo Smith moved Mickey Stanley from center field to shortstop for the Series in place of the light-hitting Ray Oyler  switched Northrup from right field to center and put Kaline in right. In Game 5  with the Tigers down 3 games to 1 and trailing in the game by 3-2  Kaline delivered a two-run single that gave the Tigers the lead  and they went on to win in seven games behind the pitching of Mickey Lolich and Denny McLain. Kaline hit .379 for the Series with two home runs and eight runs batted in. He reached the postseason only one more time  when the Tigers lost to the Oakland A’s in the 1972 American League Championship Series. Kaline had a .297 career batting average  with 1 583 runs batted in and 1 622 runs scored. After retiring as a player  he was a longtime commentator for the Tigers’ television broadcasts and then a special assistant in the team’s front office. When Detroit played its last game at Tiger Stadium  in September 1999  Kaline brought the lineup card to home plate  receiving a standing ovation. He is honored with a bronze statue behind the center-field wall at Comerica Park  where the Tigers play today. In addition to his son Mike  he is survived by his wife  Madge Louise (Hamilton) Kaline; another son  Mark; and four grandchildren. Early in Kaline’s career  Ted Williams raved about him. “In my book he’s the greatest right-handed hitter in the league ” Sports Illustrated quoted Williams as saying. “There’s no telling how far the kid could go.” But Kaline  as baseball’s youngest batting champion — Cobb was slightly older when he won the title in 1907 — faced heavy burdens. “The worse thing that happened to me in the big leagues was the start I had ” Kaline told Sports Illustrated in 1964. “Everybody said this guy’s another Ty Cobb  another Joe DiMaggio. How much pressure can you take?” Kaline performed brilliantly nonetheless  and on Sept. 24  1974  just before his career came to a close  he doubled off the Orioles’ Dave McNally at Baltimore’s Memorial Stadium for his 3 000th hit  the hometown boy back in town to achieve a rare baseball feat.

Margaret Burbidge  Astronomer Who Blazed Trails on Earth  Dies at 100, She was denied access to a telescope because of her sex  but Dr. Burbidge forged ahead anyway  going on to make pathbreaking discoveries about the cosmos., Supported by She was denied access to a telescope because of her sex  but Dr. Burbidge forged ahead anyway  going on to make pathbreaking discoveries about the cosmos. By Margalit Fox  E. Margaret Burbidge  an astrophysicist who made pathbreaking findings about the state of the cosmos  not the least of which was discovering precisely what it entailed to succeed as a woman in a male-dominated universe at midcentury  died on Sunday at her home in San Francisco. She was 100. Her daughter  Sarah Burbidge  said the cause was complications from a fall. A native of England who worked largely in the United States  Dr. Burbidge built a career that was stellar in both senses. She was considered one of the foremost astronomers in the world  long regarded as a trailblazer for women in the field. Dr. Burbidge was the first woman to serve as director of the Royal Observatory  the storied British institution. She was also a contributor to the design of instruments carried aboard the Hubble Space Telescope and a recipient of the National Medal of Science  bestowed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan. “She has a huge imprint on the history of modern astronomy and cosmology and nuclear astrophysics ” George Fuller  a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California  San Diego  where Dr. Burbidge taught for many years  said in an interview for this obituary in 2017. Dr. Burbidge had made her reputation by studying stars  often in collaboration with her husband  the astronomer Geoffrey Burbidge. Their research included a landmark article describing the formation within stars of nearly all the chemical elements — those incumbents of the periodic table that are the stuff of life in the universe. She also studied the properties of galaxies and the nature of quasars and in later years came to question the Big Bang theory  the cornerstone of modern cosmology. Her achievements were all the more noteworthy for having been made in a discipline that was a time-honored bastion of swaggering masculinity. It was a field in which  early in her career  she was denied access to the very instrument an observational astronomer needs most: a telescope. Eleanor Margaret Peachey was born in Davenport  in northwest England. “I was born on Aug. 12  1919  a date which  at age 11 or 12  when I had been given a much bowdlerized account of the ‘facts of life’ by my mother  struck me as a weird and wonderful coincidence: The beginning of my existence as a few-celled creature must have coincided with the World War I armistice  Nov. 11  1918 ” Dr. Burbidge wrote in a 1994 autobiographical essay in The Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics. She added  “My excitement in telling my mother this deduction was not greeted with enthusiasm nor with any further explanation.” But her family encouraged scientific curiosity in other respects. Her father  Stanley Peachey  was a chemistry lecturer; her mother  Marjorie (Stott) Peachey  had been his student. When Margaret was a small child  the family moved to London  where Mr. Peachey pursued a career in industrial chemistry. He earned several lucrative patents  including one for a process that streamlined the vulcanization of rubber. At 4  crossing the English Channel with her family at night for a holiday in France  Margaret looked heavenward and was smitten. “It’s the first time I really noticed the stars ” Dr. Burbidge recalled in a 1978 oral history interview. “A small child brought up in London doesn’t get to see much of the sky  because it’s so often cloudy.” She entered University College London in 1936 and studied astronomy  physics and mathematics  graduating with first-class honors in 1939. She stayed on for graduate work at its parent institution  the University of London  earning a Ph.D. there in 1943. During the war  she worked as the caretaker of the telescope at the university’s observatory  a job normally done by men. She used the opportunity to carry out her own observational research: London’s wartime blackouts made the stars more accessible than they had been in years. She married Geoffrey Burbidge  a University of London graduate student  in 1948. Inspired by her  he switched from physics to astronomy. In the late 1940s  seeking better telescopes and clearer skies  Margaret Burbidge applied for a fellowship from the Carnegie Institution for Science. The award would have let her work at Mount Wilson Observatory  near Pasadena  Calif. Her application was declined. Women  she was informed  were not permitted to use Mount Wilson’s telescopes. “The situation for women in astronomy has changed dramatically in my lifetime ” she told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2005. “Young women now are very surprised to learn that women were once not allowed on Mount Wilson and that men making the rules somehow developed the idea that the wives of the astronomers would not like the thought of their men working with women ‘during the night’!” She managed to gain access to Mount Wilson some years later  but only by posing as her husband’s assistant. The couple was obliged to live in a rustic  unheated cottage on the mountain  a far cry from the heated accommodations  complete with resident chef  in which the male astronomers were housed. Over the years  Dr. Burbidge also worked at the California Institute of Technology; the Harvard College Observatory; Yerkes Observatory  the University of Chicago’s facility in Williams Bay  Wis.; and the McDonald Observatory  near Fort Davis  Texas  now operated by the University of Texas at Austin. She joined the University of California  San Diego  in the early 1960s and went on to become the first director of its Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences. At her death  she was university professor emeritus there. With her husband  the American physicist William Fowler and the English astronomer Fred Hoyle  Dr. Burbidge wrote a 1957 article that is considered one of the most influential scientific papers of its era. Titled “Synthesis of the Elements in Stars ” but known in astronomical circles simply as B2FH  it was published in the journal Reviews of Modern Physics. In it  the authors argued that nearly all of the chemical elements  from aluminum to zinc  are forged in the bodies of stars  a process now called stellar nucleosynthesis. It was already known that the lightest elements  like hydrogen and helium  had been created amid the Big Bang. But the origin of the heavier elements  including the carbon that makes up plants and animals  the oxygen in the atmosphere and the gold and silver mined from the ground — in sum  the very matter of the universe — was the subject of longstanding debate. The thesis of B2FH  now widely accepted  is that the heavier elements are synthesized from the lighter ones by thermonuclear reactions within stars. Loosed into space  these elements can also recombine to form new stars  beginning the cycle once more. As the article describes it  we are all  in essence  made from stars. “That work laid the foundations for all of modern nuclear astrophysics  and particle astrophysics as well ” Dr. Fowler said. “It gave a blueprint for how the elements were formed in the cosmos.” (For work on the evolution of stars in general  Dr. Fowler shared the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics with the Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.) Dr. Hoyle and the Burbidges also became known for their opposition to the Big Bang theory  by midcentury a heretical view. The Big Bang theory holds that the universe was created in a single primeval explosion and that it has been expanding ever since  growing continually less dense as a result. The minority view  propounded by Dr. Hoyle and subscribed to in part by the Burbidges  is known as steady-state theory. It holds that the universe is formed by the continual creation of matter  without beginning or end. As a result  its density remains constant over time. In its obituary of Dr. Hoyle  who died in 2001  The New York Times described his steady-state model as a theory that “now has few adherents.” Margaret Burbidge served as the director of the Royal Observatory from 1972 to 1973. It was striking  commentators noted  that she was not simultaneously named Astronomer Royal. That post  considered part of the royal household  had been automatically awarded to the observatory’s director since the observatory was founded in the 17th century. This time  it was given to a man. Dr. Burbidge  a naturalized American citizen  was the first woman to serve as president of the American Astronomical Society  a post she held from 1976 to 1978. She was also a past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Her other laurels include the Helen B. Warner Prize from the American Astronomical Society  shared with her husband  and the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. She had an asteroid named for her  Minor Planet 5490 Burbidge. Dr. Burbidge made headlines in the early 1970s when she refused a prize  the Annie Jump Cannon Award. Presented by the American Astronomical Society  it is earmarked for women. “If my strong feeling is against any kind of discrimination ” she told Science magazine in 1991  “I have to stretch that to include discrimination for women too.” Geoffrey Burbidge died in 2010. In addition to her daughter  Dr. Burbidge is survived by a grandson. In her 1994 essay  Dr. Burbidge recalled having been turned away from the Mount Wilson Observatory as a watershed moment in her professional life. “The letter of denial opened my eyes to a new and somewhat frightening situation: new  because I had never before experienced gender-based discrimination ” she wrote. However  she continued: “A guiding operational principle in my life was activated: If frustrated in one’s endeavor by a stone wall or any kind of blockage  one must find a way around — another route towards one’s goal. This is advice I have given to many women facing similar situations. I tell them: Try it  it works.” Julia Carmel contributed reporting.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/coronavirus-car-insurance.html, business, Some Insurers Offer a Break for Drivers Stuck at Home, Allstate and American Family Insurance are pushing savings to customers automatically. Many others have not. We asked., Supported by Your Money Allstate and American Family Insurance are pushing savings to customers automatically. Many others have not. We asked. By Ron Lieber The best kind of financial help is the kind that you don’t have to ask for. On Monday  Allstate and American Family Insurance said they would give their personal auto insurance customers a break  since most of them aren’t driving as much as they did a month or two ago. The savings don’t amount to a lot. Allstate will give most customers 15 percent of their monthly premium back in April and May  via a credit to their bank account  credit card or Allstate account. American Family will send auto insurance customers $50 for each vehicle on their policies. But the nature of the action is exemplary — and rare — given the context of a pandemic. People are sick  and many more are struggling. Nobody wants to have to think to call their auto insurer  let alone wait out the call-center deluge afflicting most financial services companies. Auto insurance companies are in an advantageous position in the quest to eke out a public relations win in these grim times. If people drive less  they crash less. Fewer crashes mean fewer claims. And fewer claims means more premium money sitting around on an insurer’s books. (Regulators in all the states where Allstate and American Family do business generally have to approve their plans to return customers’ cash  but they expect to start sending their refunds soon.) “We know there’s been a significant reduction in miles driven and claims filed for personal vehicles since the pandemic began limiting people’s activity ” American Family wrote in an F.A.Q. on the repayments. “We are not seeing similar claim trends in our other lines of insurance  such as homeowners where filed claims are increasing  likely from people staying home more  resulting in more accidents.” (Be careful with those fireplaces  please.) Allstate and American Family’s relative largess does raise a question though: Just how good have the stay-at-home orders been for auto insurers’ bottom lines? Allstate’s chief executive  Thomas J. Wilson  said the company was acting on relatively little information right now. But what it has gathered was eye-opening. “After one week’s worth of data came in  we knew this was significant ” he told me. “And it was less than two weeks from when we first saw the data to when we made this announcement.” Mr. Wilson said that driving to work was usually about one-third of people’s total miles on the road. But there are many unknowns insurers are still facing as a result of the stay-in-place orders  he said. The people who are still driving are driving faster  based on Allstate’s data. Will they crash more and do more damage when they do have a wreck? How long will the pandemic last? When it ends  will everyone still want to — and get to — work from home twice a week? Mr. Wilson said he would not know how profitable Allstate’s auto insurance operation would be without answering all those questions and more. American Family threw up its hands in similar confusion. “We’re returning to our customers estimated savings based on our best determination of what we know now ” a company spokesman  Ken Muth  said in an email. “We’ll continue to focus on aligning what we charge in premium to the expected costs associated with providing the insurance coverage  which is primarily paying out claims.” Doug Heller  an insurance expert with the Consumer of Federation of America  saw all of this coming a few weeks ago. The organization published a letter asking insurance companies to adjust their premiums in anticipation of a likely fall in claims. And his colleague Micah Hauptman has urged customers to call their insurers and ask for a better deal. Mr. Heller said in an interview that he was surprised at the two insurance companies’ decisions  since there hadn’t been much pressure on them. He said that probably would have changed  though  because state insurance regulators usually keep an eye out for excessive rates. “They’re collecting all this premium and aren’t seeing accidents or claims  so they have a choice ” Mr. Heller said. “They either start giving back money or have to explain their coronavirus windfall at some point.” On Monday  I made like a regulator and went to nine other auto insurance companies and asked them whether they intended to match Allstate and American Family. So far  nobody is  but a couple sound close. A Progressive spokesman said that the company was “exploring how to best return some premium to customers” and that it expected to have those plans in place “soon.” And State Farm said its officials were “closely monitoring our automobile insurance loss trends and are considering how best to take this into account and return value to our auto insurance policyholders. We expect a decision in this regard by the end of the week.” USAA said: “We are exploring options to continue serving our members well during this difficult time. We’ll share more in the coming days.” Others were vague. A Liberty Mutual spokesman said the company was “continually evaluating ways that we can support our customers.” And from Nationwide: “We continue to evaluate all of our options.” Travelers said: “We are working with our customers and their agents to address their changing circumstances and continue to consider a number of programs to support them further in this rapidly evolving situation.” Others did not immediately answer my questions on Monday: Farmers  Geico and Chubb. If you’re a customer of any of those companies  let me know what they say if you call and ask for a break. Every one of them should be looking at the same numbers Allstate’s chief executive is — and having the same reaction. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/business/07virus-lieber/merlin_171005643_9bf8d603-596e-4d2b-85f0-5e0fb41e56d8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-ron-lieber/author-ron-lieber-thumbLarge.png 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/energy-environment/pge-bankruptcy-wildfire-victims.html, business energy-environment, PG&E Deal With Wildfire Victims Challenged Over Share Price, The falling price of the utility’s stock  which is part of a $13.5 billion settlement  has complicated the company’s exit from bankruptcy by June 30., Supported by The falling price of the utility’s stock  which is part of a $13.5 billion settlement  has complicated the company’s exit from bankruptcy by June 30. By Ivan Penn and Peter Eavis Four months ago  Pacific Gas & Electric seemed poised to emerge from bankruptcy after reaching a $13.5 billion settlement with tens of thousands of people who lost homes in wildfires started by the utility’s equipment. Investors cheered that agreement  bidding up the company’s share price by nearly 40 percent. But the deal now appears to be in danger — and with it the company’s hopes of getting back on its feet by a crucial deadline. Some homeowners say they no longer intend to vote for the deal in bankruptcy court because half the money they are set to receive will be in PG&E shares. The shares’ value has tumbled in recent weeks in the broad stock sell-off prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. Three of the 11 victims on a bankruptcy court committee representing those with fire claims against PG&E have resigned. The remaining members rejected the deal in a court filing on Monday. . The flare-up of opposition threatens a key element of PG&E’s reorganization plan. Unless the company can emerge from bankruptcy by June 30  it will be ineligible for a new state fund defraying damage claims from future wildfires — the kind of liability exposure that drove it into bankruptcy court last year. “It’s a house of cards in that everything is interconnected ” said George Triantis  a professor at Stanford Law School. If a majority of victims vote down the agreement  PG&E will probably miss the state deadline. “I’m not sure that it’s in the interest of the tort victims to cause this to fail ” Mr. Triantis said. Wildfire victims are not speaking with one voice. Some support the deal and are campaigning for a yes vote  arguing that this is the best deal they can get  including through newspaper ads. Erin Brockovich  the consumer advocate made famous through her pursuit of a 1993 case against PG&E involving contamination of drinking water  urged wildfire victims to accept the agreement in an opinion article last week in The San Francisco Chronicle. She is a consultant for the law firms of Joseph M. Earley and Watts Guerra LLP  which represent thousands of wildfire victims. With so much effort spent “pounding out the best possible agreement to make people whole ” Ms. Brockovich said in an interview  “to derail it and create more division at the 12th hour will be a travesty.” The deal that some want to change gives the victims half of the $13.5 billion in cash and half in shares of the company that emerges from bankruptcy. In accepting stock  the victims and their lawyers were taking a risk. Even before the coronavirus outbreak  PG&E’s stock was volatile. A major fire involving its equipment could send its shares plunging  leaving victims short. The stock closed at $8.56 on Monday  down from nearly $18 in late February. PG&E defended the agreement in a statement on Monday  noting that lawyers representing thousands of victims still backed the deal. The company also said the recent drop in its share price was a result of broader economic anxieties. “Since PG&E entered Chapter 11  the company’s primary goal has been to get victims paid fairly and in a timely manner ” the utility said. But Kirk Trostle  who lost his home in the Camp Fire  says the company’s plan is “deeply flawed and very risky for all fire victims.” Mr. Trostle was one of the first members of the bankruptcy’s tort claimants committee that represents victims to resign his position. “I’m not trying to force people to vote for or against the plan ” Mr. Trostle said in an interview. “I want all fire victims to make an educated decision.” Adolfo Veronese and Karen Gowins  two other committee members who lost homes to fires started by PG&E equipment  have also resigned. Ms. Gowin’s lawyer  Steven Kane  said that on a call last week involving scores of lawyers for victims of Northern California wildfires caused by PG&E’s equipment  several urged delaying any vote on the settlement to keep their clients from “holding the bag for PG&E’s recklessness and negligence.” Other lawyers say they were not persuaded by those arguments. Gerald Singleton  a lawyer based in San Diego who says he represents 7 000 fire victims in the bankruptcy  told the court in a brief filed Monday that he rejected arguments opposing the settlement. Mr. Singleton said the agreement was the best way for victims to be paid quickly. “We certainly understand that there are risks and flaws in this plan  as there are in everything ” Mr. Singleton said. “This is really the only opportunity for our clients to get a fair settlement in a reasonable amount of time.” Large shareholders behind PG&E’s restructuring plan will probably push back against opponents of the deal. Better terms for the victims would mean worse ones for shareholders  which  according to the most recent records available  include prominent hedge funds like Baupost Group  Abrams Capital Management and Knighthead Capital Management. Because the bankruptcy plan rests on shareholders’ putting $9 billion of new money into PG&E — cash that will help pay victims — the shareholders’ participation is crucial. And they could be particularly resistant to compromise because the recent decline in PG&E’s stock may have left them with large losses on their stakes in the company. “If you rattle the cage too much  the deal could collapse ” said Jared A. Ellias  a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law. To get a better deal  the victims would have to change a central feature. Under the current plan  they would get shares valued at 14.9 times estimated future profits. Lawyers for the deal’s opponents are concerned that PG&E’s shares will trade well below that multiple  meaning the victims’ shares — meant to be valued at half the overall $13.5 billion settlement — would be worth much less. Because the shareholders putting in new money would get shares at a much lower valuation  their holdings would in theory have greater protection against losses. Increasing how much cash the victims get may be a way to compromise  Mr. Ellias said  adding  “There is still a pathway to make this work.” PG&E appeared to have cleared the last major hurdle when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on the reorganization plan last month after gaining several concessions from the utility  including veto power over new board members and a trigger to sell the company if certain benchmarks were not met. The timing of the governor’s support was critical if not pragmatic  since the worsening pandemic has largely halted economic activity and dominated his attention.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html, sports soccer, U.S. Says FIFA Officials Were Bribed to Award World Cups to Russia and Qatar, For nearly a decade  Russia and Qatar have been suspected of buying votes to win hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. On Monday  for the first time  the Department of Justice put things in black and white., Supported by For nearly a decade  Russia and Qatar have been suspected of buying votes to win hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. On Monday  for the first time  the Department of Justice put things in black and white. By Tariq Panja and Kevin Draper After years of investigations and indictments  the United States Department of Justice on Monday said for the first time that representatives working for Russia and Qatar had bribed FIFA officials to secure hosting rights for the World Cup in men’s soccer. Prosecutors made the accusations in an indictment charging three media executives and a sports marketing company with a number of crimes  including wire fraud and money laundering  in connection with bribes to secure television and marketing rights for international soccer tournaments. The accusations were the latest in a yearslong corruption case that has already produced convictions of numerous soccer officials and executives as well as depositions from former leaders of FIFA  world soccer’s governing body. Never before  though  have prosecutors so clearly described the scheme that helped deliver the votes that gave Russia and Qatar hosting rights for one of the world’s biggest sporting events. The U.S. prosecutors on Monday explicitly revealed details about money paid to five members of FIFA’s top board ahead of the 2010 vote to choose Russia and Qatar as hosts. Russia defeated England and joint bids from Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal to host the 2018 men’s tournament. Qatar  a tiny desert state that has spent billions of dollars to prepare for the 2022 World Cup  defeated the United States in a runoff by a group of voters that had already been trimmed because two members had been secretly filmed agreeing to sell their votes. Three South American officials  according to the indictment  received payments to vote for Qatar. One of the officials  Julio Grondona of Argentina  died in 2014. Another  Nicolás Leoz  died in Paraguay last year while under house arrest and fighting extradition to the United States. The third man  Ricardo Teixeira  the former leader of soccer in Brazil  remains in that country  which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Leoz and Teixeira were indicted in 2015 on charges related to bribery schemes to sell lucrative soccer rights to sports broadcasters. The U.S. prosecutors also stated in Monday’s indictment that the former soccer official Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago  who has been fighting extradition to the U.S. since 2015  received $5 million through a string of shell companies to vote for Russia. Some of the money  the indictment said  came “from companies based in the United States that performed work on behalf of the 2018 Russia World Cup bid.” Rafael Salguero  a Guatemalan soccer official who pleaded guilty in 2016 to money laundering and fraud charges  was promised $1 million to give his vote to Russia  the indictment said. None of the former soccer officials were immediately available for comment. Officials at Russia’s soccer federation and FIFA did not reply to an email sent after business hours to request comment. Qatar has long denied allegations of acting improperly despite facing a slew of accusations since it started bidding for soccer’s biggest prize. A FIFA document alluded to the bribery scheme last year. The names of Grondona  Leoz and Teixeira and references to payments they received were included in an ethics document justifying a lifetime suspension of Teixeira from FIFA. The allegations against the South Americans mirror those made by Alejandro Burzaco  a former Argentine television executive who turned state’s witness after being named as a central figure in the soccer corruption case. He said at the New York trial of three other officials in 2017 that Leoz  Grondona and Teixeira had been paid to vote for Qatar. More than half the people involved in the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups  including the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter  have been accused of wrongdoing  though not necessarily criminally charged. The choice of Qatar — a country with such hot summers that five years after the vote FIFA was forced to move the start of the 2022 World Cup to November — received most of the attention after the votes. But Russia  too  has faced allegations of improper bidding behavior. Russian officials told a FIFA panel that investigated its bid that they could not turn over computers used during the process to a FIFA investigator because they had all been destroyed. Last May  almost a year after Russia staged the World Cup  Gianni Infantino  who came out of relative obscurity to secure the FIFA presidency after the corruption scandal took down almost all of the organization’s senior leadership  received the Order of Friendship medal from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Two of the sports media executives who were charged in Monday’s indictments  Hernan Lopez and Carlos Martinez  formerly worked for international subsidiaries of 21st Century Fox. This was the first time the federal government had formally accused Fox  which won the rights to televise the 2018 and 2022 World Cups  or any of its executives of wrongdoing. During the 2017 trial  Burzaco accused Fox of bribing officials  an accusation that the company denied at the time. Lopez  49  was the president and chief executive of Fox International Channels  and Martinez  51  was the president of Fox Networks Group Latin America. According to the prosecutors  the pair participated in a scheme that paid millions of dollars in bribes to officials of South America’s continental soccer federation  in order to direct how the officials awarded broadcast rights for the Copa Libertadores  South America’s premier club soccer competition. They are also accused of using inside information to help Fox win the English-language rights in the United States to televise the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Lopez and Martinez “relied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes ” according to the indictment. Among other things  the prosecutors said  the bribes helped Fox obtain confidential information “regarding bidding for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments in the United States.” Through their lawyers  Lopez and Martinez denied the charges and accused the U.S. government of pushing forward a thin case. “The indictment contains nothing more than single paragraph about Mr. Lopez that alleges nothing remotely improper ” Matthew Umhofer  a lawyer for Lopez  said in statement. Steven McCool  a lawyer for Martinez  called the charges “nothing more than stale fiction.” Neither the Fox Corporation nor Disney — which acquired most of Fox’s international assets in 2019 — immediately responded to a request for comment. In 2011  it was announced that Fox had agreed to pay more than $400 million for the English-language rights in the United States to the men’s 2018 and 2022 World Cups  as well as to the women’s 2015 and 2019 World Cups. The win was a surprise  as ABC and ESPN had broadcast the men’s World Cup since 1994. FIFA later awarded Fox the rights to broadcast the 2026 World Cup without holding an open bidding process  after Fox had challenged the federation’s decision to move the 2022 tournament to late fall from its traditional summer window. Lopez left Fox in 2016 to start the podcast company Wondery; Martinez left in 2019. Also charged Monday was Gerard Romy  a former executive of a Spanish media conglomerate  and Full Play  a Uruguay-based sports marketing company. Hugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis  the owners of Full Play  were charged individually in 2015 as part of the first FIFA indictments in the case.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/trump-sports-return-coronavirus.html, sports, Despite Trump’s Optimism  Lack of Sports Could Extend Into the Fall, Public officials and sports leaders  worried events could wipe out gains made in the pandemic  are examining shortened seasons or not having them at all., Supported by Public officials and sports leaders  worried events could wipe out gains made in the pandemic  are examining shortened seasons or not having them at all. By Ken Belson and Marc Stein Although President Trump has expressed optimism that sports leagues could resume play “sooner than later ” sports leaders have been planning for a longer postponement of games and events  extending into the fall and possibly later. After meeting with the commissioners of several major sports leagues on Saturday  Mr. Trump discussed resuming sports in August  ESPN reported  though Mr. Trump later told reporters at the White House  “I can’t tell you a date  but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later.” “I want fans back in the arenas ” he said at the White House  adding  “As soon as we can  obviously.’’ Still  a range of sports leaders and public officials have cast doubt on normalcy returning anytime soon  and even fall events face uncertainty over concerns that a renewal of mass gatherings could undermine any gains made in the fight against the pandemic by then. The N.F.L.  which is scheduled to conduct its annual draft from April 23 to 25 by videoconference  has said it is focused on not altering the regular season  which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 10. But some team owners say there is a good chance the international games in London and Mexico City will be moved back to the United States  and one owner raised the possibility that the season could be reduced from 16 games to as few as 10. An N.F.L. spokesman  Brian McCarthy  said the league’s decisions will be “guided by the latest advice from medical and public health officials  as well as current and future government regulations.” The N.F.L.’s chief medical officer  Dr. Allen Sills  was more definitive. “As long as we’re still in a place where when a single individual tests positive for the virus that you have to quarantine every single person who was in contact with them in any shape  form or fashion  then I don’t think you can begin to think about reopening a team sport ” Sills told NFL.com last week. “Because we’re going to have positive cases for a very long time.” The N.B.A. and N.H.L.  which were deep into their 2019-20 seasons before they were suspended last month  may be unable to finish their seasons because the cities they play in have restrictions on nonessential travel and because of the difficulty of acquiring enough test kits to ensure the safety of the players  team staffs and workers in arenas. Mike Bass  a spokesman for the N.B.A.  which would have started its postseason on April 18  said  “Any decision on a date to restart the season is likely weeks away and will be made in consultation with public health experts and in line with governmental directives and guidance.” Major League Soccer  which had started its regular season  and Major League Baseball  which had its spring training interrupted  are looking at truncated schedules. Both leagues have also contemplated playing games in empty stadiums  though it is unclear how risky that might be to players and to employees who produce the games. Officials in both leagues said they prefer to play with fans in the seats. Either way  sports leagues and tournaments say they will let the advice of medical experts  not the president  guide their decisions on when to resume play. “I hope so ” Mark Cuban  the owner of the Dallas Mavericks  said Monday when asked about Trump’s “sooner rather than later” forecast. “But I won’t do anything that doesn’t put the safety of our employees and customers first. Nothing is more important than their health.” Indeed  the governors of two of the country’s largest states — California and New York  which together host more than 20 teams in the five largest leagues — said they were skeptical of the president’s timeline. “I’m not anticipating that happening in this state ” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said Saturday after the president spoke. “One has to be very cautious here  one has to be careful not to over promise.” Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said he  too  will rely on guidance from medical experts. “I would love to see sports back  help with cabin fever ” he said on Sunday. “But this is not about hopes and dreams and aspirations and what you would like to see. None of us like being here. Follow the data  follow the science  let the professional doctors  health care professionals tell you when it’s safe to reopen and that’s when you reopen.” Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio  whose family owns a minor-league baseball team  told 850 ESPN Cleveland radio that “we’ll be lucky” to have professional baseball games played by July. “What complicates it is that every state is at a different phase of this ” he said. “To play a national sport like baseball  you’re going to have to get out of this  I guess  about everywhere.” Epidemiologists have warned that even when the number of new cases starts to fall  travel barriers and curbs on gatherings in many places could persist until a vaccine or a treatment is found. The risk otherwise is a resurgence  given the prevalence of asymptomatic people who might unknowingly carry the virus. Amid the uncertainty about when it will be safe to resume play  leagues and tournaments continue to come up with contingencies. The N.F.L. could delay the start of training camp and eliminate some or all of its preseason games and bye weeks to hold the Super Bowl  as scheduled  on Feb. 7  2021  one N.F.L. owner said. In college sports  the Pac-12 Conference will be guided by two factors: what public health and state officials say and what activities are allowed on campuses  a conference official said. For example  if students are not sitting in classrooms  players will not be sitting in meeting rooms. Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour told reporters in a conference call last week that she thought if players could safely return 60 days before the first game — essentially by around July 1 — then the season could proceed as scheduled. An N.C.A.A. spokesman declined to respond to Mr. Trump’s assertion that sports were likely to return this summer. The N.B.A. has explored bringing all the teams to Las Vegas to play games without fans  akin to the G League Showcase it stages there every December or its Summer League model. But there are doubts about how the league could oversee a safe and effective quarantine for the players  coaches and the dozens  and perhaps hundreds  of other people needed to operate the games. The players would also need at least a month to get into playing shape after such a sudden and long layoff. Josh Hart of the New Orleans Pelicans said it was “just too hard” for the N.B.A. to resume operations “any time in the next two  three  four months.” The N.H.L.  which also was close to finishing its regular season  is checking with teams about the availability of arenas through August and other logistics to see if there is a chance to reschedule games. Some organizations have already adjusted their calendars. On Monday  golf’s governing bodies rescheduled the Masters tournament  the United States Open and the P.G.A. Championship and canceled a fourth men’s major championship  the British Open. And the W.N.B.A. had already postponed the start of its regular season  which was to begin on May 15.  Three weeks ago  moving the major spring marathons to September and October seemed prudent. Now  a Sept. 14 date for the Boston Marathon (normally held in April)  and a Nov. 1 date for the New York City Marathon look curious  though neither event has announced any change from those dates. Chris Weiller  a spokesman for New York Road Runners  said  “It’s falling on the organizers to make decisions ahead of the direction of government.” Major League Soccer  whose teams played two games before being shut down on March 12  has flexibility to move the M.L.S. Cup final back to Dec. 19 because it reorganized its schedule last season to trim its playoff format and move up its championship by one month. The N.F.L. and M.L.S. are reluctant to play games in empty stadiums. But M.L.B.  which was deep into spring training before it shut down  is willing to play without fans so games are at least televised. Even without fans  the league would have to find enough coronavirus tests for the players  coaches  trainers  support staff  television production crews and other personnel. The league would need the approval of the players’ union if it chooses to play in empty stadiums. The league has no plans to cancel big chunks of the season. Rather  it would cancel small pieces as it goes along. The league is also considering playing at neutral sites for regular season and postseason games.

Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/sports/06virus-sports-1/06virus-sports-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-ken-belson/author-ken-belson-thumbLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-marc-stein/author-marc-stein-thumbLarge.png 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/arts/virus-wellness-self-care.html, arts, Our Health Is in Danger. Wellness Wants to Fill the Void., To the wellness industry  the coronavirus represents not just a loss but an opportunity for self-actualization. Miranda Kerr and Tom Brady are among the celebrities on the bandwagon., Supported by Critic’s Notebook To the wellness industry  the coronavirus represents not just a loss but an opportunity for self-actualization. Miranda Kerr and Tom Brady are among the celebrities on the bandwagon. By Amanda Hess We all have our coping mechanisms  some more productive than others. Lately I’ve found a perverse form of escapism by scrolling through the Instagram feeds of wellness influencers — intuitive nutritionists  adaptogenic alchemists  plant-based-lifestyle evangelists — to see how well they’re doing now. In a word  they are glowing. Miranda Kerr  the model turned organic beauty entrepreneur  is posing with a bitten apple in a leafy yard and optimizing her quarantine by “spending extra time on my skin care routine and doing a daily mask.” Jordan Younger  who blogs as the Balanced Blonde  is reporting from the midst of a 14-day “water fast ” advising her followers to “go inward” as “this time on earth is happening FOR us and not TO us.” And Amanda Chantal Bacon  a lifestyle guru who sells earthy supplements through her company Moon Juice  is ensconced in a white bathrobe  cradling a mug in one hand and an infant in the other  her beatific gaze framed by a luxe tumble of hair. The caption is riveting. Bacon has assembled a menagerie of emoji — toadstool  ringed planet  garlic bulb  DNA double-helix  lathered bar of soap  the yin and yang symbol — suggesting a sordid congress between the scientific and the mystical. She proffers her wisdom as an “immunomodulation enthusiast ” counseling against “sugar  fighting  alcohol  fear  processed foods  isolation and stagnation” and instead pushing liposomal vitamin C  acupuncture  broth  one-minute cold showers and the consumption of various adaptogens — a category of herbal supplements that claim to protect the body against stressors  which Moon Juice grinds into dusts and sells for $38 per 1.5 ounce jar. There’s nothing like a pandemic to clarify the distinction between wellness and actual health. Our collective health is  most would agree  not so good. But through the logic of wellness branding  this situation can represent not just a loss of lives and livelihoods  but an opportunity. With the right motivational texts and quasi-medicinal products  well-positioned individuals are empowered to recast their quarantine as a self-actualization incubator  a chance not just to fend off the virus itself but to achieve their peak physical  mental and spiritual forms. There is something ghastly about these efforts. Even when a pandemic is not raging  the very idea of a person advertising a 14-day fast makes me want to call the police. Yet the wellness evangelists have intuited a real paradox in this moment: As our health care system buckles under the strain of the virus  and citizens are isolated at home  self-care has never felt more urgent. The virus has the power to kill the people it has infected  and to instill stress  grief  loneliness and despair in the people it has not. “The anxiety is what is most oppressive here ” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a recent briefing. Lifestyle brands invite us to regain a sense of control  if only over our nutritional intake  hygienic practices and apartment interiors. In the past few weeks  it seems as if the entire internet has pivoted to wellness. Actors have transformed into home-cooking instructors; pop stars are leading meditations; fashion bloggers are hawking sponsored loungewear. The showbiz couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon have rolled out a podcast  “Staying In with Emily and Kumail ” about adapting to indoor life with the help of a Nintendo Switch. The public is seeking self-care tips from Cuomo’s PowerPoint presentations and from a loner who has lived in an abandoned mining town for 50 years. I am doing yoga for the first time ever  ending every day by bowing my head and whispering “namaste” to my virtual instructor. These coronavirus self-help guides offer tips on how to maintain mental health and relationships under quarantine. But some wellness practitioners are reaching further. Everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow to Tom Brady is pushing an “immune support” supplement  which sure seems to imply immunity from the virus. Kerr was recently publicly shamed for sharing a “virus protection” guide from a “medical medium” who credits himself as the leader of “the global celery movement.” And Bacon was dinged for posting an “immunity” guide that intermingled hand-washing tips with Moon Juice products like Power Dust and Spirit Dust. With just a feeble tweak of messaging  however  these same influencers have solicited praise for their epidemic response. Moon Juice is running a coronavirus giveaway on its Instagram  shipping off “immuno packs” to people who deliver groceries or work in nursing homes; Kerr recently donated a bunch of her brand’s “vitamin C” face serums to health care workers at the Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center  then shared grateful posts from nurses on her feed. With a firm command of the woo-woo lexicon  a brand is capable of capitalizing on the crisis without saying anything at all. The pièce de résistance of coronavirus branding is perhaps this Moon Juice post from March 24  which offers a cosmic perspective on the situation: “This New Moon offers us a date with destiny. We are being called to birth new versions of ourselves  as the world morphs around us. Let us burn off resistance and dance with the unknown.” It concluded: “We are learning just how resilient we are.” The text was followed by a recipe for a blend of hot milk and coffee with a dusting of Cordyceps  a “bioactive supershroom ” which Moon Juice claims is “said to increase drive  stamina  and reduce fatigue.” The modern wellness movement in America arose in the 1960s as counterprogramming to the predominant idea of health. If health was framed as the prevention of disease  and managed through the medical system  wellness was pitched as an active  positive pursuit organized around the self. The idea was fused with productivity: Halbert Dunn  chief of the National Office of Vital Statistics  promoted the idea of “high-level wellness ” an “integrated method of functioning  which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable.” And it could be spun into a whole lifestyle  complete with its own consumer accessories  from jogging gear to Jane Fonda videos  Lululemon pants to GOOP goops. It’s easy to see how this idea migrated from its nominally countercultural beginnings into a luxury feature. When Audre Lorde wrote about self-care as “an act of political warfare” in the 1980s  she was talking about managing her cancer in the face of a system that was hostile toward her as a black lesbian. Health care remains a pricey commodity in America  but now wealthy people have co-opted “self-care” as a status symbol. They have the ability to appear not just healthy but radiantly well. Now  as the health care system flails in its coronavirus response — with basic needs like tests  masks and ventilators terrifyingly scarce — the promises of strange elixirs and fine powders feel more deranged and seductive than ever. Wellness content used to merely gesture at some kind of spiritual necessity  but it has now proved itself truly crucial. Moon Juice likes to say that it offers “self care for communal care ” and while it is ludicrous to imagine that spooning ground mushroom into one’s coffee benefits one’s community in any way  in this case it borders on being technically correct. Public health legitimately relies on the efforts of each individual to cope in isolation  and if it helps to lace a beverage with mushroom powder  then great. The optimism of this content borders on the delusional  but we have been told to keep our spirits up. Wellness may be fundamentally self-absorptive  but we can be forgiven for gazing at our own navels when there’s not much else for us to look at. Still  there is something disquieting about the slick translation of the crisis into the logic of branding. When a fleet of lifestyle bloggers turned a public health warning into a synergistic exercise — they each held up a sign in flowery influencer script  collectively informing their audiences to “Stay home for the people you love. Be kind! Wash your hands. Let’s flatten the curve!” — they probably thought they were using their platforms for good. But they were also helping to reaffirm the reorganization of community under their various cults of personality. We are living in an upside-down time where the president of the United States is promoting unproven virus cures on television  but Paltrow appeared in a protective mask on Instagram more than a month before the C.D.C. recommended that everyone put them on. Health may be scarce  but wellness is still in stock.

04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/books/c-pam-zhang-how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold.html, books, How a Chinese-American Novelist Wrote Herself Into the Wild West, C Pam Zhang’s debut  “How Much of These Hills Is Gold ” is one of several new or forthcoming books by Asian-American writers set in a period that historically hasn’t recognized them., Supported by C Pam Zhang’s debut  “How Much of These Hills Is Gold ” is one of several new or forthcoming books by Asian-American writers set in a period that historically hasn’t recognized them. By Concepción de León The day in 2015 that C Pam Zhang was laid off from her first job out of college  she celebrated with friends at the park  then promptly made plans to move to Bangkok. She had been working at a tech start-up in San Francisco for several years  she said  “kind of stress-testing this question of whether I could be happy doing something that was not writing.” But the layoff felt liberating  so she decided to live off savings for a while and give writing a real shot. “I was like  I’m giving myself a year ” Zhang said in an interview last month. “I’ve been complaining all this time about not having the time to write. Will I actually write when I have the time  or am I just a big fake?” Over seven months in Thailand  she wrote more than a dozen short stories  in the process landing on the sort of work she wanted to do: speculative fiction that dealt with themes like death  migration and loneliness. That year  she also drafted a novel. Set during the Gold Rush with elements of magical realism  it focuses on two orphaned siblings who are fending for themselves in an American West where tigers roam. The book  “How Much of These Hills Is Gold ” is due out from Riverhead on Tuesday. It is inspired by the emotional currents of Zhang’s upbringing  particularly the loneliness and insecurity of a childhood spent moving around. It also reckons with grief  something she experienced after losing her father when she was 22. “The death of a parent has this really strange gravity  no matter how many years you get away from it ” Zhang  now 30  said. “It warps everything else around it.” In “How Much of These Hills Is Gold ” the siblings  Lucy and Sam  go into survival mode after their father dies and they are left penniless in a hostile town. “One thing I wanted to reflect on in the book was how when you mourn in a way that is repressed  it will haunt you ” Zhang said. “You can’t get away from it.” Born in Beijing (the C in her name is short for Chenji)  she moved to the United States  where her parents were already living  when she was 4. She had 10 different addresses by the time she was 18  as her parents sought out better job opportunities or school systems for her and her younger sister. But one move stands out. When Zhang was 8  the family packed up their car and drove from Lexington  Ky.  to Salinas  Calif. “I was so struck by the landscape of America ” she said  recalling areas where they were pounded by torrential rain or in the plains of Oklahoma  where she could see weather patterns from miles away. “It’s really beautiful but also  in many parts of the country  extremely bleak and kind of scary.” Those lasting impressions informed her reading habits. A fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder and John Steinbeck  she said  “Eventually I realized that the people in these books that I loved were always white. I wanted to write a great American epic in which I saw myself reflected.” Sarah McGrath  who edited the book  said that reading it reminded her of Colson Whitehead’s “The Underground Railroad” or Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West ” which “help me understand our culture and our history in a new way  not by telling it directly  but by showing it through emotion and relationships and its art.” “How Much of These Hills Is Gold” is one of several new or forthcoming books by Asian-American writers set in 1800s America. There is “The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu” by Tom Lin  forthcoming from Little  Brown  which is set 150 years ago and follows a Chinese-American assassin seeking revenge after his wife is abducted. “Prairie Lotus ” published last month  is a book for young readers that its author  the Korean-American writer Linda Sue Park  describes as a “painful reconciliation” of her youthful love of Wilder’s “Little House on the Prairie” books with the sometimes racist views they espoused. “I would lie in bed and imagine that I was Laura’s best friend and make up adventures that we would have together ” Park said. But she realized that  not only were people who looked like her not visible in the story  “but that even if I had been  Laura’s mother  in particular  would probably have never even let her get close to me.” This time period — the Gold Rush and its aftermath — and Chinese-Americans’ role in it is ripe for re-examination. Until recently  the roughly 15 000 Chinese-American laborers who worked on the first Transcontinental Railroad  built in the 1860s  were all but erased from the historical record and later barred from obtaining citizenship by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. A well-known photograph from the inauguration of the Transcontinental Railroad inspired a moment in Zhang’s book. Lucy  one of the main characters  “hears the cheer that goes through the city the day the last railroad tile is hammered. A golden spike holds track to earth ” Zhang writes. “A picture is drawn for the history books  a picture that shows none of the people who look like her  who built it.” “How Much of These Hills Is Gold” is not meant to encapsulate the Chinese-American experience of that time  but rather to portray “the loneliness of being an immigrant and not being allowed to stake a claim to the place that you live in ” Zhang said. In light of the discrimination Asian-Americans are facing as the coronavirus has disrupted life  however  she feels her book is more relevant than ever. When she began writing it  “I actually worried that the book’s depictions of naked racism and violence would seem too extreme  too maudlin ” she said. “Now I’m reminded that these ugly attitudes toward Asian-presenting people have always lain just under the veneer of the country  and that they are erupting now.” After growing up moving from place to place  Zhang has settled in San Francisco  where she lives with her partner and their cat and dog. She works part-time as a creative director for a skin-care start-up  and though she sometimes struggles with the stillness of domesticity  she values financial security  having grown up in a family in which money was sometimes tenuous. “We don’t talk enough about how  especially for people who come from immigrant backgrounds  from poor backgrounds  from impoverished families  that money is a source of emotional comfort ” she said. “It’s not just money.” Thinking about the literature of the West that she has long been drawn to  and the way it showed “that ordinary people can lead epic lives against this epic backdrop ” Zhang said  she feels similarly about immigrants’ stories. “How they’ve crossed entirely new lands and traded one life for another — those stories are epic in nature ” she said. “They deserve to be told in that way.” Follow New York Times Books on Facebook  Twitter and Instagram  sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Elena Aprile  a dark matter scientist and physics professor at Columbia University  was supposed to return to Italy but has been stranded in Brooklyn.Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York Times Supported by By Dennis Overbye Elena Aprile was in a race against time. Her Xenon experiment  one of the world’s largest and most expensive investigations into the nature of dark matter  was coming together beneath Gran Sasso  a mountain in Italy. But Dr. Aprile  a Columbia University physics professor  was stuck in her apartment in Brooklyn as New York entered an indeterminate period of lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus  and she was “living on Cheerios and milk ” she said. In Italy  about a month into its own lockdown  a skeleton crew was trying to finish assembling her experiment’s expensive and delicate detector and safely seal it in place deep below the mountain’s rocks  before the virus brought down the hammer on even this much group activity. What followed was an illustration of how some science is managing to get done during a plague. At stake was perhaps nothing less than the secret of the universe. Astronomers have reluctantly concluded over the last half-century that most of the matter in the universe is invisible. They suspect that this invisible stuff consists of giant cosmic clouds of subatomic particles called “wimps ” for weakly interacting massive particles  left over from the Big Bang. Mostly impervious to normal forces like electromagnetism  these particles drift through the world  and through us  like ghosts through a wall. In the quest to spot them  physicists have built a succession of bigger and bigger detectors. But as they’ve gained greater and greater clarity  they have seen no wimps  which has created a crisis in physics. In the 1970s and 1980s  fashionable but speculative concepts in particle physics were devised to explain some of the deeper mysteries of fundamental physics. One  supersymmetry  suggested that the universe might be littered with undiscovered particles that could act like dark matter. But over the years  the most promising models of what these particles might have been were slowly crossed out. This leaves many of the mysteries of the universe — like why stars are so big and atoms are so small — with no plausible explanation. The wimp experiments keep improving. But eventually they could reach a limit called the “neutrino floor ” becoming so sensitive that they are overwhelmed by neutrinos  ghostly super-elusive particles that flood the universe from the sun  the stars and the Big Bang. Any wimps passing through will be impossible to discern in this sea  and there the wimp search will end. “So we have a few more years where this guy can hide  but it’s not there yet ” she said. Dr. Aprile and her team — a globe-spanning confederation — planned to record the pit-pat of dark matter particles raining into a tank of liquid xenon lined with 500 photomultipliers and other sensors  and placed far underground to shield it from cosmic rays. The hope was that her team’s device would spot the rare collision of a wimp with a xenon nucleus  an event she estimated might happen about once a year per ton of xenon. Dr. Aprile was reluctant to put a price on the project. An earlier version of the experiment with 3.3 tons of xenon cost $30 million. But that didn’t include the people  she said. A big part of the cost is xenon itself  which costs around $2 million per ton  she added. Her new detector will have 8.5 tons. A rival experiment called the LZ Dark Matter Experiment  also using eight tons of xenon  was being assembled in an old gold mine that is now the Sanford Underground Research Facility  in Lead  S.D. And there is a whole alphabet soup of other experiments stashed in old mines and tunnels around the world  with names like PandaX  DarkSide and SuperCDMS. But now coronavirus was infecting even the cosmos. Richard Gaitskell of Brown University  one of the principal scientists of the LZ experiment  said in an email that their project had temporarily been mothballed “out of an abundance of caution and to allow personnel to respect shelter in place.” Dr. Aprile said  “All of us will have delays due to this damn thing. If one of my people gets sick  I will feel so bad.” Dr. Aprile was born in Milan. To say that she lives a peripatetic life would be an understatement. She teaches at Columbia but commutes regularly to L’Aquila  a town in central Italy near the Gran Sasso National Laboratory  which lies off a tunnel through the mountain of the same name  beneath nearly 4 600 feet of rock. Until March she had been living the typical jet-setting life of particle physicist. In November she attended a physics conference in South Korea. In February  after a brief stop in New York  she was in Italy at Gran Sasso for three days. From there she went to a conference in South Africa  and on to the University of California  San Diego  where she was a visiting professor. Then the universities shut down. Worried about her two daughters  who live in New York  Dr. Aprile returned home. She had planned to return to Gran Sasso in early May after her professorship was done  when they would start testing and running their detector. But the virus had other plans. Stefano Ragazzi  director of the Gran Sasso lab  said that the experiments there are designed to be conducted remotely. As a result  there were only about half a dozen scientists on site in March when the coronavirus hit Italy. It is safer and easier to keep experiments running  rather than shut them off and later switch them back on  he explained  so the lab’s experiments have continued to operate as they would during the winter holidays. Dr. Ragazzi announced that  to ensure the safety of the people and the equipment  work in Gran Sasso would be limited only to what was necessary. “Xenon was amid critical ongoing operations ” Dr. Ragazzi said in an email. “We asked them to come to a safe stopping point and to pause operations.” That stopping point would come once the detector had been sealed in its cryostat — a big thermos bottle that could keep the xenon inside at minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit — and all the air had been pumped out  Dr. Aprile said: “The point is to enclose it in a cryostat  seal it  make it leak-tight.” She spoke over the phone after a long day of teleconferencing with Italy. “We close this detector for the first time inside this big water tank ” she said. “Then we spend a few months  if everything goes well  commissioning it to understand how the hell it works. Hopefully it works as you designed. You start to see if there’s a signal. And that’s when you declare OK  and then you start to work.” All did not go well. An important step occurred on March 5  when a team led by Luca Grandi of the University of Chicago installed the detector underground. It had arrived in pieces at Gran Sasso from all over the world  “like the pieces of a puzzle ” Dr. Aprile said  and had to be assembled in a “clean room” in a part of the Gran Sasso lab that was aboveground. The finished detector  known as a time projection chamber  is about five feet long and five feet wide  and weighs half a ton without the xenon in it. The team had to rent a special truck and get a police escort to move it to the underground part of the lab  which is accessible through a highway tunnel under the mountain. “We didn’t realize it would be so hard to handle ” Dr. Aprile said. There the detector was installed under the dome of the cryostat. But the cryostat was not ready to be closed. “We were almost done  but now we needed special permissions ” Dr. Aprile said. Failure to finish installing the detector would leave the tank open to the air  which would increase the chance of contamination by radon  a radioactive gas found in underground spaces and the main source of contamination in experiments like this one. A minimum of three or four people were needed to handle these final steps. Dr. Aprile had a half-dozen scientists and technicians at the site  so the margin was getting thin. But Dr. Grandi had to leave to teach in Chicago. Dr. Aprile promoted Petr Chaguine  a scientist from Rice University who had been living in Gran Sasso  to direct the team. He reported back to his friends and family in Houston that his Italian colleagues were “kindly translating news and new government regulations” as they appeared  which was often. For a while  the team members approved by Dr. Ragazzi could car-pool from their homes to the lab. Then the rules changed and they had to drive separately. Another rule required a Glimos — Group Leader in Matter of Safety — to visit every day to make sure everything was in order. Roberto Corrieri was doing the job  then announced that he would follow governmental instructions and stay home in Assergi; then he changed his mind and stayed. The only other person who could have done the safety inspection had left to join his family in Naples. “I did not want to push the boundary if he felt he wanted to stay home ” Dr. Aprile said of her conversations with Mr. Corrieri. “Luckily he is a good guy and realized that doing it was important for many people  so he agreed to do it.” She added  “I fear  what happens if the team gets infected or gets hurt. The lab gets the blame." That left enough people in the lab to continue working. “I had to do a lot of encouraging ” Dr. Aprile said. It helped that they knew each other  and that there were no strangers on the team: “So they were comfortable being close enough to work.” On March 20  Dr. Aprile received a photo by email of a pair of her scientists  Masatoshi Kobayashi and Danilo Tatananni. They were garbed much like E.R. doctors  in “bunny suits” and masks  which are standard apparel for the clean rooms where sensitive scientific gadgets are assembled. The men were standing in front of her detector  which they had just closed up. “We did it ” the email said. The physicists will now spend two weeks pumping air from the vat  down to a vacuum  at which point it can be monitored remotely. The task of filling the vat with liquid xenon must wait. “We cannot test drive our new car ” Dr. Aprile said. She was happy and relieved to no longer have to reluctantly urge her colleagues to enter a field of danger. “They feel like heroes ” she said. “Was it worth it? I’m wondering myself.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/science/06SCI-DARKMATTERCOVERSUB1/06SCI-DARKMATTER1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/multimedia/author-dennis-overbye/author-dennis-overbye-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/science/06SCI-DARKMATTER2/merlin_171253929_9a847e19-a19b-401d-bf1b-bfe31e4a583c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/science/microfibers-plastics-ocean-biology.html, science, To Study a Problem That’s Everywhere  They’re Getting Creative, , Dimitri Deheyn’s lab has become a hub of novel research on the microfibers found in our waterways and even the air we breathe. Dimitri Deheyn of the the Scripps Institution of Oceanography with a sample of his primary research subject: microfibers.Credit...Alex Welsh for The New York Times Supported by By Sarah Elizabeth Richards SAN DIEGO — Three years ago  Dimitri Deheyn noticed intensely blue stringy shapes as he examined jellyfish samples through a microscope in his marine biology lab at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California  San Diego. He assumed his lens was dirty  so he wiped it off with a special cloth. Then he tried taking it apart and airbrushing the optics. But the particles kept showing up. At first  Dr. Deheyn thought the culprit might be microplastics  tiny plastic bits that have invaded the oceans in the past decade. But a quick literature search revealed that the stringy shapes  each about a fifth as wide as a strand of hair  were actually microfibers from fabric. He wondered if they came from his students’ clothing  or the aquarium where the jellyfish was kept  or the freshwater used to wash down the equipment. But after he collected seawater samples from off Scripps’ research pier  it became clear that they had come in with the jellyfish from the ocean. Dr. Deheyn’s microscope problem prompted him to join the growing number of scientists who are scrambling to understand the magnitude of the problem of microfibers in the environment. We shed them while running in our fancy moisture-wicking apparel  and we release a river of them when we wash our clothes. They find their way into our waterways  our drinking water  the fish we eat and even the air we breathe. One 2018 study of the distribution of plastic particles in seawater found that 91 percent were microfibers. “They’re affecting the ecosystem in ways we’re not aware of ” Dr. Deheyn  a Belgian native raised in Rwanda  said in an animated French accent. “We don’t know if they generate cell stress  or are responsible for chronic disease  or if they can irritate the lungs.” Dr. Deheyn started his academic career focused on studying the mysteries of bioluminescence and how changes in the light or color of aquatic animals reflected their health. Now he has made his lab a hub of microfiber research  devising novel and creative approaches to document their effects on health and marine life  which he says is drastically understudied. “We’re trying to collect air  water and sediment samples to see where the fibers are and what’s driving them ” he said. Dr. Deheyn has cultivated a vast network of researchers and citizen-scientists to bring him samples that provide snapshots of microfiber pollution in various locations. “Some activist just asked me  ‘I’m going to French Polynesia  can I bring something back?’” he said. During the French swimmer Ben LeComte’s attempt to cross the Great Pacific garbage patch in 2018  Dr. Deheyn asked researchers on the support boat to collect water and fish samples. He also works with Greenpeace  as well as the Manhattan-based Explorers Club’s Young Explorers Program  whose members brought back snow and water samples from the North Pole. (There were microfibers in them.) Soon he hopes to get a bird’s-eye view as Robert DeLaurentis  the “Peace Pilot” who began a six-month pole-to-pole circumnavigation around the globe in November  agreed to place squares of sticky tape on his plane’s nose and wing tips to measure microfiber concentrations during 30 flight legs over cities  rain forests and deserts. Dr. Deheyn is also working with Lenzing  an Austrian producer of cellulose fibers made from wood pulp  to test their biodegradability — part of an industry attempt to reduce the synthetic materials frequently used in soaringly popular “fast-fashions.” Every Friday morning for this project  Holly Nelson  a college senior in Dr. Deheyn’s lab  walks onto the Scripps research pier over the sparkling Pacific and hauls up three metal baskets bobbing near the water’s surface. She pulls off long ropes of dangling kelp and collects about two dozen mesh pouches containing business card-size swatches of fabric ranging from cotton to polyester and spandex. Back at the lab she examines them under a microscope to document the ocean’s toll on the materials  from the effects of sunlight and wave action to the variety of sea life that grows on them. She is part of a team that has spent the last year tracking how quickly the fabrics disintegrate in seawater. A second experiment looks at another set of swatches on the ocean floor 30 feet below  where they are at the mercy of abrasive sand and more microbes. Dr. Deheyn saw the pier project as an opportunity not only to test Lenzing’s cellulose material but also to look at how other treated synthetic materials break down in real time. (Traditionally  clothing manufacturers test chemical dyes  ultraviolet protection and water-repellent agents with enzymes in a temperature-controlled closed bioreactor for a few days to a month.) He was surprised when one polyester swatch that had been in the ocean for 200 days was still largely intact. “If it was a tee shirt  you could still wear it today ” he said. In the Scripps research aquarium  Dr. Deheyn is also running a parallel study in which more swatches are placed in individual containers to record how many microfibers they release. Using an instrument developed by Jessica Sandoval  an engineering student  researchers shine a black light to make them fluorescent and then use software similar to what’s used in facial recognition to capture their unique stringy shape. Such creative approaches are welcome in a field that has struggled to accurately chronicle the spread of microfibers  said Mary Kosuth  a doctoral student in environmental chemistry at the University of Minnesota. She has developed her own microfiber data sets by studying beer and sea salt sold in grocery stores. When scientists started studying the impact of plastics in the ocean during the last decade  they relied on nets designed to trawl for plankton  which missed the microfibers. Today  researchers are also using the “grab sample” method: They fill a jar with water and then determine the chemical makeup using spectroscopy technology that measures matter with electromagnetic radiation. “This is something that’s growing in our collective consciousness ” Ms. Kosuth said. “We have a pretty good body of research that these particles are ubiquitous.” This year she tested a sample of her backyard snow and now forbids her two young children from catching snowflakes on their tongues. But researchers still have a long way to go to prove that all these fibers are hurting human or animal health. “There’s been little work done  said Chelsea Rochman  an ecologist at the University of Toronto who studies the health effects of plastics. “We know we’re exposed  but we don’t know what the consequences are  if any.” Of particular concern are fibers  both synthetic and natural  that have been treated with chemicals during the manufacturing process or that might absorb other contaminants in the environment. There is some research suggesting that microfibers can affect crustaceans’ reproductive systems by making them lay fewer eggs or produce offspring that were stunted or died sooner than normal. In Dr. Deheyn’s lab  Alysia Daines  a visiting scholar from Aarhus University in Denmark  is testing their effects on the development of sea urchin embryos. Amid this uncertainty  Dr. Deheyn speaks to fashion industry conferences on the need to produce fewer synthetic fabrics  and more clothing manufacturers are reaching out to him. Entrepreneurs are making washing-machine filtration systems that would catch fibers before they enter the environment  and consumers are embracing new business models  including clothing rental or resale  that could lessen the fashion industry’s impact. “Climate change is so big that people have a hard time getting their head around it ” Dr. Deheyn said. “But the choice of what we wear and how we wash our clothes  people can grasp that concept.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/science/00SCI-MICROFIBERS1/00SCI-MICROFIBERS1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/science/00SCI-MICROFIBERS2/00SCI-MICROFIBERS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/coronavirus-aid-governors-pearl-harbor.html, us, Amid Warnings of a Coronavirus ‘Pearl Harbor ’ Governors Walk a Fine Line, As officials warned people to brace for a surge in cases and deaths  governors pleaded for a consistent strategy and more help from Washington., Supported by As officials warned people to brace for a surge in cases and deaths  governors pleaded for a consistent strategy and more help from Washington. By Rick Rojas and Vanessa Swales As the surgeon general told the nation to brace for “our Pearl Harbor moment” of cascading coronavirus deaths this week  several governors said on Sunday that their states were in urgent need of federal help and complained that they had been left to compete for critical equipment in the absence of a consistent strategy and coordination from the Trump administration. Some clearly walked a delicate path  criticizing what they saw as an erratic  inadequate federal response  while also trying to avoid alienating the White House as states vie with one another for resources both from Washington and on the market that can mean the difference between life and death. “I’m grateful for the help that we’ve gotten ” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan  a Democrat  said in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” But she also expressed her alarm over what she described as “not having a national strategy where there is one policy for the country as opposed to a patchwork based on who the governor is.” The result  she added  “is creating a more porous situation where Covid-19 will go longer and more people will get sick.” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington  also a Democrat  was more blunt in his depiction of a chaotic federal response. “This is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this ” Mr. Inslee said in an interview on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “To say  ‘we’re a backup’ — I mean  the surgeon general alluded to Pearl Harbor. Can you imagine if Franklin Delano Roosevelt said  ‘I’ll be right behind you  Connecticut. Good luck building those battleships’?” President Trump at a news conference on Sunday tried to balance the grim short-term prognosis with a more optimistic view of the fight against the pandemic. He said he saw “light at the end of the tunnel” as his administration marshaled the “full power of the American government and American enterprise.” And he dismissed criticism from some governors as mere politics. Instead  Mr. Trump said he had worked in close concert with governors as the federal government has sent out ventilators  masks  gloves and gowns across the country. “We have the best doctors  the best military leaders and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world  and we’re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done ” Mr. Trump said. The back and forth came as federal officials have projected a particularly bad week ahead  as many Americans prepared to observe Passover and Easter without traditional services or family gatherings. Three major metropolitan areas — New York  Detroit and New Orleans — have seen death rates rise rapidly  and other states are anticipating a peak in cases later this month. In New York  where the death toll has climbed to over 4 000 people  with more than 122 000 confirmed cases  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Sunday that there were indications of “slight plateauing.” But he noted that it was too soon to say whether the changes in the numbers were indicative of a trend. In Louisiana  Gov. John Bel Edwards said his state could run out of ventilators as soon as Thursday. And Mr. Cuomo described the logistical struggle in New York to get hospitals the equipment they need. “I can’t say to a hospital  ‘I will send you all the supplies you need  I will send you all the ventilators you need ’” he said in a briefing on Sunday. “We don’t have them. It’s not an exercise. It’s not a drill. It’s just a statement of reality. You’re going to have to shift and deploy resources to different locations based on the need of that location.” The increasingly dire need for ventilators and protective equipment has touched off a race between states  cities and hospitals to buy up the equipment. In a conference call with the nation’s governors last month  Mr. Trump told the states that the federal government would be backing them  but that they should try to procure their medical supplies themselves. “We’ve been outbid by another state after we had the order confirmed  so yes  that has been challenging for us ” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas  a Republican  said on “Meet the Press.” “But we recognize that the federal government has said  ‘We’re your backstop. You’ve got to get out there and compete.’ And it literally is a global jungle that we’re competing in now.” Governors have aired their frustration as they called on the Trump administration to do more  like using the federal Defense Production Act more aggressively to ramp up manufacturing of the necessary equipment or putting in effect a national stay-at-home order. Many governors have been tempered in their criticisms  acknowledging the need for a solid working relationship with the president as the crisis continued to grow. But in interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows  some ventured further as they pushed for the administration to take stronger action. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois  who is also a Democrat  accused the Trump administration of not reacting quickly enough to the warnings of the seriousness of the virus released by intelligence agencies in January and February. “If they had started in February building ventilators  getting ready for this pandemic ” Mr. Pritzker said on CNN’s “State of the Union ” “we would not have the problems we are having today and  frankly  very many fewer people would die.” Officials at virtually every level redoubled their efforts on Sunday to prepare the nation for a surge in illnesses and deaths  warning of an emergency that will most likely be among the most calamitous that Americans have faced. Already  more than 9 000 people have died because of the virus in the United States  a number that some experts said understates the deaths so far. Federal officials said projections showed the toll could climb to at least 100 000 people. “The next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment ” Dr. Jerome M. Adams  the United States surgeon general  said in an interview on “Meet the Press.” “It’s going to be our 9/11 moment. It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives  and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side  everyone needs to do their part.” His dire warnings were echoed by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This is going to be a bad week ” he said on the news show “Face the Nation.” He added: “It is going to be shocking to some  it certainly is really disturbing to see that  but that’s what’s going to happen before it turns around.” While Dr. Fauci said the mitigation strategies around the country appeared to be having an effect  he pushed back against a suggestion that the outbreak is under control. “I’m not saying we have it under control ” he said. “That would be a false statement. We are struggling to get it under control.” As needs have shifted  Washington State has decided to return more than 400 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile  and Oregon announced that it would send 140 ventilators directly to New York. The Chinese government facilitated the donation of 1 000 more ventilators to New York. Simon Johnson  a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who has started an alliance to develop policy proposals to combat the coronavirus  said that countries like Israel and Italy were rapidly buying up China’s extra production capacity  and that the United States was at risk of losing out. “What’s going to happen is if the states all go after the P.P.E. individually  it will not get deployed nationally in a way that makes sense ” Professor Johnson said  referring to personal protective equipment. “It’s every man or woman for themselves.” Mr. Pritzker was among the most vocal in arguing that the federal government is falling short in its role of making sure states are getting what they need. He has requested 4 000 ventilators from the federal government and noted that states do not have the same power as the federal government  especially when it comes to use of the Defense Production Act. Illinois has so far received about 450 ventilators. “There’s no way that we can stockpile in anticipation of a pandemic that no one anticipated  and yet the federal government is responsible for doing precisely that ” Mr. Pritzker said  who added that Illinois’s peak was expected toward the end of April. As of Sunday  Illinois had reported over 11 000 infections and 274 deaths  and has begun setting up makeshift hospitals. Mr. Trump has bristled at criticism from governors  saying that he has at different points directed Vice President Mike Pence to stop calling Ms. Whitmer and Mr. Inslee. “I want them to be appreciative ” he said. The president specifically called out Mr. Pritzker at his news conference on Sunday  saying  “There’s a governor I hear complaining all the time.” Mr. Trump added  “He has not performed well.” The Trump administration said that its handling of the pandemic was “about saving lives ” rising above politics and acting forcefully in trying to curb the virus’s spread. “Every level of government needs to deliver solutions  and that is what we are doing in partnership ” Judd Deere  a White House spokesman  said in a statement on Sunday. “During these difficult times  Americans are receiving comfort  hope and resources from their president  as well as their local officials  because this is an all-of-America effort.” Ray Mabus  the Democratic governor of Mississippi from 1988 to 1992  said that it was a “moral imperative” for state officials to speak up about getting the supplies and support needed. “If you don’t speak out  if you are afraid of somehow incurring the wrath of this guy  then I think you’re failing in your duty to the people who elected you.” Still  emergencies have long created tensions between federal  state and local officials. Politicians and analysts said there were added challenges now given the scope of the pandemic and the depths of the nation’s political divides. “I’d say there’s always a dance between any governor and sitting administration in knowing that you have to draw between the lines and look for ways of working constructively with that administration regardless of your party ” said Mark Sanford  the former South Carolina governor and Republican congressman  who lost his seat in Congress after Mr. Trump endorsed his primary opponent. That said  he added: “This president’s a bit of an outlier as it relates to a perceived slight or the perception of loyalty  and who seems to think things in remarkably personal terms  whether slight was meant  or regardless of intent.” For now  facing the prospect of a brutal few weeks  many governors are arguing for a more aggressive national approach and doing what they can in their own states. Ms. Whitmer  the Michigan governor  contended that a more stringent response now could help contain the pandemic  even if it means sharper immediate economic pain. “The shorter we make it ” she said  “the better for our health and the better for our economy.” Mike Baker  Michael Crowley  Ana Swanson and Katie Thomas contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/05virus-governors-1/merlin_171075144_a44ec876-1d77-4adb-9565-1ea9a9392cc3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Lina Evans  the coroner in Shelby County  Ala.  said she is now suspicious about a surge in deaths in her county earlier this year  many of which involved severe pneumonias.Credit...Bob Miller for The New York Times Supported by By Sarah Kliff and Julie Bosman WASHINGTON — A coroner in Indiana wanted to know if the coronavirus had killed a man in early March  but said that her health department denied a test. Paramedics in New York City say that many patients who died at home were never tested for the coronavirus  even if they showed telltale signs of infection. In Virginia  a funeral director prepared the remains of three people after health workers cautioned her that they each had tested positive for the coronavirus. But only one of the three had the virus noted on the death certificate. Across the United States  even as coronavirus deaths are being recorded in terrifying numbers — many hundreds each day — the true death toll is likely much higher. More than 9 400 people with the coronavirus have been reported to have died in this country as of this weekend  but hospital officials  doctors  public health experts and medical examiners say that official counts have failed to capture the true number of Americans dying in this pandemic. The undercount is a result of inconsistent protocols  limited resources and a patchwork of decision making from one state or county to the next. In many rural areas  coroners say they don’t have the tests they need to detect the disease. Doctors now believe that some deaths in February and early March  before the coronavirus reached epidemic levels in the United States  were likely misidentified as influenza or only described as pneumonia. With no uniform system for reporting coronavirus-related deaths in the United States  and a continued shortage of tests  some states and counties have improvised  obfuscated and  at times  backtracked in counting the dead. “We definitely think there are deaths that we have not accounted for ” said Jennifer Nuzzo  a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security  which studies global health threats and is closely tracking the coronavirus pandemic. Late last week  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance for how to certify coronavirus deaths  underscoring the need for uniformity and reinforcing the sense by health care workers and others that deaths have not been consistently tracked. In its guidance  the C.D.C. instructed officials to report deaths where the patient has tested positive or  in an absence of testing  “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” In infectious outbreaks  public health experts say that under typical circumstances it takes months or years to compile data that is as accurate as possible on deaths. The reporting system during an epidemic of this scale is particularly strained. And while experts say they believe that virus-related deaths have been missed  the extent of the problem is not clear. But as mayors and governors hold daily news conferences reporting the latest figures of infections and deaths related to Covid-19  Americans have paid close attention to the locations and numbers of the sick and dead — one of the few metrics available for understanding the new and mysterious disease threatening their communities. Public health experts say that an accurate count of deaths is an essential tool to understand a disease outbreak as it unfolds: The more deadly a disease  the more aggressively the authorities are willing to disrupt normal life. Precise death counts can also inform the federal government on how to target resources  like ventilators from the national stockpile  to the areas of the country with the most desperate need. For families who have lost a loved one in the midst of this epidemic  there is an urge simply to know: Was it the coronavirus? As the coronavirus outbreak began sweeping across the country last month  Julio Ramirez  a 43-year-old salesman in San Gabriel  Calif.  came home from a business trip and began feeling unwell  suffering from a fever  cough and body aches. By the next day  he had lost his sense of taste and smell. His wife  Julie Murillo  took him to an urgent care clinic several days later  where he was so weak he had to be pushed in a wheelchair. Doctors prescribed antibiotics  a cough syrup and gave him a chest X-ray  but they did not test for the coronavirus  she said. Just over a week after he returned from his trip  Ms. Murillo found him dead in his bed. “I kept trying to get him tested from the beginning ” Ms. Murillo said. “They told me no.” Frustrated  Ms. Murillo enlisted friends to call the C.D.C. on her behalf  urging a post-mortem test. Then she hired a private company to conduct an autopsy; the owner pleaded for a coronavirus test from local and federal authorities. On Saturday afternoon  19 days after the death  Ms. Murillo received a call from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  she said. The health department had gone to the funeral home where her husband’s body was resting and taken a sample for a coronavirus test. He tested positive. In a statement  the health department said that post-mortem testing has been conducted on “a number of cases ” but did not provide specifics or comment on Mr. Ramirez’s case. The work of counting deaths related to the virus falls to an assortment of health care providers  medical examiners  coroners  funeral homes and local health departments that fill out America’s death certificates. The documents typically include information on the immediate cause of death  such as a heart attack or pneumonia  as well as on any underlying disease. In coronavirus cases  that would be Covid-19. The federal government does not expect to produce a final tally of coronavirus deaths until 2021  when it publishes an annual compilation of the country’s leading causes of death. A New York Times tally of known Covid-related deaths  based on reports from state and local officials  showed 9 470 deaths as of Sunday. On Friday  the National Center for Health Statistics  part of the C.D.C.  began publishing preliminary estimates of coronavirus deaths  although a spokesman said that information would have a “lag of 1-2 weeks.” Its first estimate noted 1 150 deaths  based on the number of death certificates that included Covid-19 as an underlying disease. “It is not a ‘real time’ count of Covid deaths  like what the states are currently reporting ” Jeff Lancashire  a spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics  said. But those who work with death certificates say they worry that relying only on those documents may leave out a significant number of cases in which coronavirus was confirmed by testing  but not written down in the section where doctors and coroners are asked to note relevant underlying diseases. Generally  certificates require an immediate cause  and encourage — but do not require — officials to take note of an underlying disease. Then there are the many suspected cases. Susan Perry  the funeral director from Virginia  said that she was informed by health workers and families that three recently deceased people had tested positive for the virus so that she and her staff could take necessary precautions with the bodies. Only one death certificate mentioned the virus. “This probably happens all the time with different diseases  but this is the first time I’m paying attention to it ” Ms. Perry said. “If we don’t know the numbers  how are we going to be able to prepare ourselves and protect ourselves?” Early in the U.S. outbreak  virus-linked deaths may have been overlooked  hospital officials said. A late start to coronavirus testing hampered hospitals’ ability to detect the infection among patients with flulike symptoms in February and early March. Doctors at several hospitals reported treating pneumonia patients who eventually died before testing was available. “When I was working before we had testing  we had a ton of patients with pneumonia ” said Geraldine Ménard  chief of general internal medicine at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans. “I remember thinking it was weird. I’m sure some of those patients did have it. But no one knew back then.” An emergency department physician in San Francisco recalled two deaths that were probably coronavirus but not identified as such. One patient died at home; a relative in the same home later tested positive for the disease. Another patient was an older man who came to the hospital with typical coronavirus symptoms  and who had been in contact with someone recently traveling to China  but arrived at the hospital before testing was available. In New York City  emergency medical workers say that infection and death rates are probably far higher than reported. Given a record number of calls  many ambulance crews have encouraged anyone not critically ill to stay home. The result  medics say  is that many presumed coronavirus patients may never know for sure if they had the virus  so any who later die at home may never be categorized as having had it. Across the country  coroners are going through a process of re-evaluation  reconsidering deaths that occurred before testing was widely available. Coroners and medical examiners generally investigate deaths that are considered unusual  or result from accidents or suicides  or occur at home. Joani Shields  the coroner in Monroe County  Ind.  said she wondered about a man diagnosed with pneumonia who died in early March. A coronavirus test was requested at the time  but the local health department denied it  Ms. Shields said  on the ground that the supply of tests was too limited. “I wish we could have tested him ” she said. In Shelby County  Ala.  Lina Evans  the coroner  said she was now suspicious of a surge in deaths in her county earlier this year  many of which involved severe pneumonia: “We had a lot of hospice deaths this year  and now it makes me go back and think  wow  did they have Covid? Did that accelerate their death?” Ms. Evans  who is also a nurse  is frustrated that she will never know. “When we go back to those deaths that occurred earlier this year  people who were negative for flu  now we’re having the ‘aha!’ moment ” she said. “They should have been tested for the coronavirus. As far as underreporting  I would say  definitely.” Even now  as testing is more widely available  there is a patchwork of standards about information being reported by state and local health officials on deaths in the United States. Around the world  keeping an accurate death toll has been a challenge for governments. Availability of testing and other resources have affected the official counts in some places  and significant questions have emerged about official government tallies in places such as China and Iran. In the U.S.  uncertainties and inconsistencies have emerged  and health departments have had to backtrack on cases of previously reported deaths. Florida officials rescinded an announcement of a Covid death in Pasco County. In Hawaii  the state’s first announced coronavirus death was later re-categorized as unrelated after officials admitted misreading test results. Los Angeles county officials announced that a child had died from the virus  then said they were unsure whether the virus caused the death  then declined to explain the confusion. Adding to the complications  different jurisdictions are using distinct standards for attributing a death to the coronavirus and  in some cases  are relying on techniques that would lower the overall count of fatalities. In Blaine County  Idaho  the local health authority requires a positive test to certify a death the result of coronavirus. But in Alabama  the state health department requires a physician to review a person’s medical records to determine whether the virus was actually the root cause of death. “This is in the interest of having the most accurate  and most transparent data that we can provide ” said Karen Landers  a district medical officer with the Alabama Department of Public Health. “We recognize that different sites might do it differently.” So far  the state has received reports of 45 people with the coronavirus dying  but has only certified 31 of those deaths as a result of the virus. Experts who study mortality statistics caution that it may take months for scientists to calculate a fatality rate for coronavirus in the United States that is as accurate as possible. Some researchers say there may never be a truly accurate  complete count of deaths. It has happened before. Experts believe that widespread news coverage in 1976 of a potential swine flu epidemic — one that never materialized — led to a rash of deaths recorded as influenza that  in years prior  would have been categorized as pneumonia. “We’re still debating the death toll of the Spanish flu” of 1918-19  said Stéphane Helleringer  associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It might take a long time. It’s not just that the data is messy  but because the effects of a pandemic disease are very complex.” Sarah Kliff reported from Washington  and Julie Bosman from Chicago.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/coronavirus-queen-elizabeth-speech.html, world europe, Boris Johnson Hospitalized as Queen Urges British Resolve in Face of Epidemic, Soon after Queen Elizabeth’s rare speech  the government said the prime minister  who is infected with coronavirus  had been admitted for tests., Supported by Soon after Queen Elizabeth’s rare speech  the government said the prime minister  who is infected with coronavirus  had been admitted for tests. By Mark Landler LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after 10 days of battling the coronavirus  unnerving a country that had gathered to watch Queen Elizabeth II rally fellow Britons to confront the pandemic and reassure them that when the crisis finally ebbed  “we will meet again.” The British government said that Mr. Johnson would be undergoing tests and that he would continue to carry out his duties. But the uncertainty generated by his persistent illness underscored the sense of crisis that led the queen to address the country in a rare televised speech that evoked the darkest days of World War II. “I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time ” the queen said. “A disruption that has brought grief to some  financial difficulties to many  and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.” Her remarks were taped at Windsor Castle  where she has sequestered herself against a virus that has infected at least 40 000 people in Britain  including her eldest son and heir  Prince Charles  and other senior British officials besides Mr. Johnson. Speaking in terms both personal and historical  the queen likened the enforced separation of Britain’s lockdown to the sacrifices families made during World War II  when parents sent away their children for their own safety. She urged a country that has approached these measures with some nonchalance to commit itself to the cause. “Today  once again  many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones ” the queen said. “But now  as then  we know  deep down  that it is the right thing to do.” Before being transferred to the hospital  Mr. Johnson  55  had been in isolation in his apartment next door to 10 Downing Street  where officials said he was running a high temperature. Early last week  Mr. Johnson’s aides said they expected him to end his self-isolation on Friday. But he still looked visibly weakened when he made a statement in a video late in the week. [Analysis: Peaks  testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion.] “On the advice of his doctor  the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests ” a spokesman said Sunday. “This is a precautionary step  as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.” The British foreign secretary  Dominic Raab  is expected to lead the daily cabinet meeting on the pandemic on Monday. Under the government’s succession plan  Mr. Raab would take up Mr. Johnson’s duties if he is incapacitated. Mr. Johnson’s hospitalization is a stark illustration of how deeply the virus has struck governments around the world  sickening officials from Britain to Brazil  killing a senior aide to the supreme leader of Iran  and sending the leaders of Germany and Canada into isolation. The queen’s speech was among only a handful of times in her 68-year reign in which she has addressed the British people  apart from her annual Christmas greeting — and it carried a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father  George VI  delivered in September 1939  as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany. Like the king eight decades ago  the queen appealed to the quintessential British traits of stoicism and solidarity  and explicitly linked the pandemic to the war as a defining moment for modern Britain. This time  she said  the country needs to come together to vanquish an enemy that brings death not in the terrifying bombing raids of the Blitz but in the ordinary encounters of people transmitting a dangerous pathogen. “I hope in the years to come  everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge ” the queen said  “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline  of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country.” Buckingham Palace took extraordinary measures to protect the queen  who turns 94 this month  from infection. She recorded the speech in a large room with only a single camera operator  according to a palace official. The operator wore a mask and gloves while a skeleton crew monitored from another room. Fears for the queen’s health grew after Prince Charles announced two weeks ago that he was suffering mild symptoms of the virus. He had met his mother on March 12  only a day before his medical advisers assessed that he might have been infectious. After isolating himself for seven days at Birkhall  his residence in Scotland  Charles re-emerged  via a video link from Scotland  to dedicate a new field hospital for coronavirus patients that was constructed in less than two weeks in a cavernous convention center in London’s Docklands. On Saturday  Mr. Johnson’s 32-year-old girlfriend  Carrie Symonds  disclosed that she  too  is suffering symptoms. Ms. Symonds is pregnant; the couple announced last month that they were engaged. Other senior officials  including the health secretary  Matt Hancock  and the chief medical officer  Chris Whitty  have also had to isolate themselves because of symptoms. With 41 903 confirmed cases  and 4 313 deaths  Britain appears to be following the same grim trajectory as other European countries. The British government  however  came late to the need for social distancing  with Mr. Johnson initially balking at ordering pubs and restaurants to close. He is now an ardent convert and recorded a video from his quarantine urging people — without much success — not to flock to London parks during a sun-kissed spring weekend. Britain’s response to the pandemic has improved since that shaky start. The government has vowed to conduct 100 000 virus tests a week by the end of April  a tenfold increase over the current rate. And worries that the National Health Service would be overwhelmed by the surge of patients have subsided somewhat. The queen herself has expressed no qualms about cutting social contacts. She canceled her public schedule and left Buckingham Palace on March 19  four days before Mr. Johnson ordered a lockdown across the country. Her 98-year-old husband  Prince Philip  was flown to Windsor Castle by helicopter from his residence on the grounds of Sandringham  another of the queen’s residences. After Prince Charles announced his illness  Buckingham Palace said the queen was healthy  and it has not issued any updates on her condition. But in her appearance on Sunday  seated next to a writing desk with a flowering plant  she looked alert and at ease. The palace did not comment on a recent report in a British tabloid  The Sun  that one of the queen’s footmen  who walks her dogs  had contracted the virus. Although the royal family has endured a litany of bad news in the last year — from the bitter departure of Prince Harry and his wife  Meghan  to the messy dealings of Prince Andrew with the disgraced financier and convicted sexual predator  Jeffrey Epstein — the queen remains a revered figure among many Britons. She has used her lofty stature sparingly outside of her official schedule of investitures  diplomatic receptions and regular meetings with the prime minister (she and Mr. Johnson conducted their most recent one by phone). Her speech included familiar touches  like an expression of thanks to the doctors and nurses of the National Health Service  something she has done in countless statements after natural disasters. She noted that at 8 p.m. every Thursday  people gather at their windows or doorways to applaud the health workers. By custom  the queen addresses the nation on Christmas Day. Her other televised addresses have included in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war  before the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997  after the death of the Queen Mother in 2002  and on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Reaction to her speech was close to rapturous  across the political spectrum. “What an inspiring  steadying  reassuring Address by the Queen. Not a false note ” declared Nicholas Soames  a Conservative former member of Parliament and grandson of Winston Churchill  on Twitter. Keir Starmer  the newly elected leader of the Labour Party  said  “The Queen speaks for the whole country  and our determination to beat the coronavirus.” Still  the demands of social distancing have prevented the queen from playing the kind of highly visible role that she and previous monarchs have played during national emergencies. Her father and mother  Elizabeth  toured neighborhoods that had been bombed by the Germans during the Blitz in 1940 and 1941. Elizabeth  who was known later as the Queen Mother  said after Buckingham Palace was bombed in September 1940 that she could “look the East End in the face ” referring to the working-class neighborhoods of East London. Princess Elizabeth  the future queen  worked in the auxiliary service as a driver and truck mechanic during World War II. That experience left a lasting imprint on her and makes her a living link to Britain’s wartime experience. In one of the most personal moments of her speech  the queen referred to her first radio address  recorded by her and her sister  Princess Margaret  in 1940 for children who had been evacuated from their homes for their safety. “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure  better days will return ” the queen said. “We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.” The last line referred to “We’ll Meet Again ” a 1939 song that became a wartime favorite in Britain. With its appeal to wartime solidarity and its blunt acknowledgment of the trials to come  the speech had many of the same themes of her father’s address  memorialized in the 2010 film  “The King’s Speech ” which starred Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist. “In this grave hour  perhaps the most fateful in our history ” the king said in halting cadences  “I send to every household of my peoples  both at home and overseas  this message.” The coming conflict  he said  “will be hard. There may be dark days ahead  and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.” Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.

Then Her 3 Close Relatives Were Brought In., After crippling New York City  the coronavirus outbreak is now enveloping New Jersey’s densely packed cities and suburbs., Supported by After crippling New York City  the coronavirus outbreak is now enveloping New Jersey’s densely packed cities and suburbs. By Tracey Tully Twelve doctors at her hospital and the chief executive were sickened with the coronavirus. A colleague had died. Patients as young as 19 were being placed on ventilators. But Michele Acito  the director of nursing at Holy Name Medical Center  in the hardest-hit town in New Jersey’s hardest-hit county  felt like she was holding up. Then her mother-in-law  sister-in-law and brother-in-law arrived. The disease that has crippled New York City is now enveloping New Jersey’s densely packed cities and suburbs. The state’s governor said on Friday that New Jersey was about a week behind New York  where scenes of panicked doctors have gripped the nation. Hospitals in the state are scrambling to convert cafeterias and pediatric wings into intensive care units. Ventilators are running low. One in three nursing homes has at least one resident with the virus. At Holy Name in Teaneck  just across the Hudson River from Manhattan  two doctors are among the 150 patients being treated for the virus. The ages of the 41 people on ventilators one day last week ranged from 19 to 90. Twenty patients died in 72 hours. One of them was Edna Acito  Ms. Acito’s mother-in-law. She had turned 89 on Thursday. It was a bittersweet day with a team of medical workers singing “Happy Birthday” from the hallway  just outside a modified door made from plastic sheathing and a zipper. No visitors were allowed in. But the older woman’s nine children expressed their love through an iPad as Ms. Acito held her hand. She died early Saturday. “You compartmentalize ” Ms. Acito  57  said. “You go home. You shower it off. But when you have a family member here  you can’t scrub that off.” As of Sunday  at least 917 people in New Jersey had died of the virus  and 37  505 had been infected. New Jersey has the nation’s second-highest number of cases after New York. “We’re eyeball deep inside the surge ” said Dr. Dan Varga  the chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health  which runs Hackensack University Medical Center and 16 other hospitals in New Jersey. On Friday  Gov. Philip D. Murphy ordered that all flags be flown at half-staff. “Behave as though you’ve got it ” he said  adding  “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” Two hospitals notified state officials last week that they had run out of ventilators  the lifesaving devices that do the lungs’ work. One reported that it was nearly out of a medicine used to sedate patients on ventilators. That same day  Mr. Murphy and New Jersey’s health commissioner explained the state’s provisional plans to move refrigerated trucks to some hospitals where the morgues were quickly filling with bodies. “The fact that we’re having this conversation  folks — this is real ” said Mr. Murphy  who enacted a statewide stay-at-home order just over two weeks ago. New Jersey’s fatality and infection rates are still dwarfed by New York’s  where  as of Sunday  more than 122 000 people had been infected and more than 4 100 had died. The virus appeared to be spreading fastest in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island  where there were more than 27 000 cases  only about 10 000 fewer than in all of New Jersey. The outbreak in New Jersey is most serious in Bergen County  the state’s most populous county. It has recorded 6 187 confirmed virus cases and at least 189 deaths. Teaneck  one of the county’s biggest townships  has reported 421 cases. Ms. Acito said she expected her sister-in-law and brother-in-law  who were not on ventilators  to fully recover. She said that she considered it a blessing to be able to visit with her relatives in person. “We know how fortunate we  as a family  are to have me on the inside ” she said in an interview on Thursday. With hospitals closed to most visitors  nurses are the lifelines connecting patients and their families. At Holy Name  iPads wrapped in clear plastic to shield germs offer some patients the ability to communicate face-to-face with loved ones. “Our role is not only to provide all this care  under these circumstances ” Ms. Acito said. “It’s to be their advocate  their family member  their provider.” She added  “There’s so much to do  but we don’t ever want to lose sight that it’s a person in that bed  and  yes  they happen to be sick.” Hackensack University Medical Center  about six miles to the west  reported the first virus-related death in the Northeast  on March 10. The man who died  John Brennan  is believed to have passed the virus to a relative of the Fusco family in Freehold  in Monmouth County. The virus soon claimed the lives of four members of the large Italian-American family: Grace Fusco  the 73-year-old matriarch  and three of her children. Doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center are bracing for a surge in patients that is expected to last for weeks. The hospital’s cafeteria has been outfitted as a makeshift intensive care unit for 74 noncritical virus patients. Governor Murphy  a Democrat who has spoken frequently of his willingness to work with President Trump to get supplies and funding needed to save lives during the outbreak  has stressed the state’s pressing need for more ventilators and personal protective equipment. About 650 ventilators have been sent to New Jersey from the national stockpile  but many more are needed if hospitalization rates in the state continue to climb. Fourteen of the devices had either missing or nonfunctioning parts  state officials said on Friday. Mr. Murphy has authorized the superintendent of the State Police to “commandeer” all available protective supplies — masks  ventilators  gowns and face shields — from private companies that may have stockpiles. Hackensack and Holy Name officials said they had enough ventilators for now  but that could change rapidly. Within Hackensack’s network of hospitals  anesthesia machines have been retrofitted to operate as ventilators for patients who do not need the highest levels of care  Dr. Varga said. Still  both Hackensack and Holy Name vitally need medical professionals who are trained in critical care. “We have beds ” Dr. Varga said  “but you have to be able to manage critically ill patients in those beds.” Dr. Adam D. Jarrett  Holy Name’s chief medical officer  said he had been calling medical personnel he knows around the country to come help. The hospital has begun preparing to treat as many as 100 critically ill patients at once in one of four new intensive-care areas it created in the past few weeks. New Jersey officials have also issued a plea for volunteers with medical training; as of Friday  7 539 people had offered to help. “Whenever you go to a busy hospital  the emergency department can go from busy to OK to frenetic ” said Dr. Jarrett. “We’re frenetic all the time now.” Before last month  Holy Name had 14 negative-pressure rooms — areas designed so that air is not released into common areas  protecting patients and caregivers. It quickly built 136 more with material bought at home-supply stores. Nursing homes throughout New Jersey are under their own particular strain. More than a third of the state’s long-term health facilities have had at least one patient infected with the virus  and 83 deaths have been linked to the homes. So many staff members and patients at St. Joseph’s Senior Home in Woodbridge got sick that the state temporarily closed it and moved nearly 100 patients to another long-term care center about a half-hour away. Judith M. Persichilli  the state’s health commissioner  has announced new rules that require nursing home staff members to wear surgical masks at all times. Patients with fevers or coughs must be outfitted with masks during direct care and kept isolated on separate wings or floors. Lisa Crowley  whose mother and stepfather live at the Paramus Veterans Memorial Home  said staff members had previously been told not to wear masks  to minimize fear among patients. Almost all of her parents’ regular caregivers  she said  were home sick. “Everyone we know isn’t here ” her mother  who is 82 and has Alzheimer’s  tells her each day  Ms. Crowley said. All long-term care facilities in New Jersey have been closed to visitors for more than two weeks. The exception is final farewells to patients as the end of life nears. The lockdown  the lack of information and the fear of the virus have made families feel helpless  said Laurie Facciarossa Brewer  who runs an organization that investigates claims of elder abuse and neglect in long-term care homes. “We’re getting calls from them saying  ‘I feed my mom every day  and she won’t eat unless I’m there ’” Ms. Facciarossa Brewer said. There are rays of hope. Dr. Varga said the rate of hospitalizations had shown signs of slowing. During the week that began March 22  the number of patients at Hackensack Meridian hospitals went from 550 patients to 1 400. Last week  it climbed by only 400  to 1 800. At Holy Name  Ashley Fitzpatrick  32  was transferred from her regular nursing assignment  in the cardiac-catheterization unit  to assist with I.C.U. patients. She has two small children  and she is self-distancing when she is not at work. “My 2-year-old  he doesn’t understand why Mommy can’t pick him up ” she said. Death surrounds the Holy Name nursing staff — as of Sunday morning  51 patients had died since the hospital had its first confirmed case — but the crisis has also deepened the sense of camaraderie. “We’re leaning on each other — hard ” Ms. Fitzpatrick said. Local restaurants and Girl Scout troops have continued to send meals and snacks. On Friday  three patients had been deemed healthy enough to be removed from ventilators  Dr. Jarrett said. “When there’s a victory  it’s incredible ” he said. “But it also means when someone doesn’t make it  it’s just devastating.” Maria Cramer contributed reporting  and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/coronavirus-aircraft-carrier-roosevelt-crozier.html, us politics, He Led a Top Navy Ship. Now He Sits in Quarantine  Fired and Infected., Colleagues say the downfall of Capt. Brett E. Crozier was charging headlong into the Trump administration’s narrative that it had everything in the coronavirus pandemic under control., Supported by Colleagues say the downfall of Capt. Brett E. Crozier was charging headlong into the Trump administration’s narrative that it had everything in the coronavirus pandemic under control. By Eric Schmitt and John Ismay WASHINGTON — For days  he fended off fears that the contagion would spread unchecked through his crew. Then last week  the captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt  who had appealed to his superiors for help  was fired. By Sunday  friends said  he had come down with the coronavirus himself. The military has long adhered to a rigid chain of command and tolerated no dissent expressed outside official channels. Capt. Brett E. Crozier  the skipper of the aircraft carrier  knew he was up against those imperatives when he asked for help for nearly 5 000 crew members trapped in a petri dish of a warship in the middle of a pandemic. But colleagues say the mistake that could cost Captain Crozier his career was charging headlong into the Trump administration’s narrative that it had everything under control. Pentagon officials said that although President Trump never ordered Captain Crozier dismissed  he was displeased with the captain’s actions and let the Navy know — a sentiment Mr. Trump made very public on Saturday when he lashed out at the captain. Even so  the Navy’s top brass clashed about what to do. Adm. Michael M. Gilday  the chief of naval operations  privately urged against dismissal and argued that  per usual Navy procedures  an investigation into what went wrong on the Roosevelt should be allowed to play out. But the acting Navy secretary  Thomas B. Modly  overruled the Navy’s top admiral  saying Captain Crozier had cracked under pressure. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said on Sunday that he supported Mr. Modly’s decision. The Washington Post first reported the differing opinions among Navy officials. Navy officials acknowledged on Sunday that tensions between Captain Crozier and his immediate boss  Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker  the commander of a multiship task force including the Roosevelt  most likely complicated the Navy’s response to the viral outbreak and prompted the captain to send a four-page letter pleading for help. Officials said the letter  sent as an unclassified email  went only to other Navy personnel  but it leaked to the news media last week. Indeed  the Navy hinted at such tensions in a statement on Sunday that the findings of the investigation into what happened aboard the Roosevelt and the chain of command in the Pacific  including its “command climate ” would be submitted to Admiral Gilday on Monday. According to those who have known Captain Crozier for more than three decades  the picture Mr. Modly paints of their friend and classmate is not one they recognize. Jeff Craig  who recently retired from the Navy after serving as a captain  including a tour as second in command of the Roosevelt  worked extensively with Captain Crozier after attending the Naval Academy with him. Captain Crozier became a helicopter pilot  Mr. Craig said  earning a nickname that he retained even after he transitioned to flying jets and ultimately to commanding a carrier: Chopper. “Chopper is one of the best people I have ever known  both professionally and personally ” Mr. Craig  who now works with Amazon’s air cargo division  said in an interview Sunday. On Sunday  Captain Crozier was in quarantine in Guam  the American territory in the Pacific  dealing with a dry  raspy cough  say people who know him. At least 400 sailors from the Roosevelt who have tested negative for the virus are expected to be sent from the ship to hotels  joining 625 other sailors who have already tested negative. It is not known when Captain Crozier’s diagnosis was made  or whether the Navy was aware of his infection when he was removed from command  if the medical results came before his punishment. Friends and colleagues say Captain Crozier  50  is at peace with a decision that most likely ended a career that vaulted him from the United States Naval Academy to the prestigious job as captain of one of the Navy’s 11 aircraft carriers. Captain Crozier  a native of Santa Rosa  Calif.  started his career flying helicopters. He was then accepted for an exceptionally rare transfer to fly fixed-wing jet aircraft  eventually rising to command an F/A-18 Hornet fighter squadron. From there  he began climbing the nearly decade-long pipeline to command an aircraft carrier. Captain Crozier entered the Navy’s academically daunting nuclear power school to learn how to run the twin nuclear plants at the heart of a Nimitz-class carrier like the Theodore Roosevelt. Then  he served as the second in command of the carrier Ronald Reagan  and later as the top officer of the Blue Ridge  an amphibious command ship  in Yokosuka  Japan. But little had prepared the captain  who assumed command of the Roosevelt in November  and his crew for what happened in March. The carrier was steaming in the western Pacific  ready to respond to any emergency involving North Korea  an emboldened Chinese Navy in the South China Sea or another emerging crisis. On March 24  two weeks after pulling out of a port call in Da Nang  Vietnam  two sailors aboard the Roosevelt tested positive for the coronavirus and were flown to Guam for treatment. Two days later  fearing the scourge of a fast-spreading virus aboard the aircraft carrier  with its cramped quarters for nearly 5 000 sailors  the ship steamed into a previously scheduled stop in Guam  which has a major Navy base and hospital. Captain Crozier appealed to his superiors for help and Navy officials began responding  but that apparently was not enough. The tipping point was a four-page letter dated March 30  first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday  in which Captain Crozier laid out the dire situation unfolding aboard the warship. He described what he said were the Navy’s failures to provide him with the proper resources to combat the virus by moving sailors off the vessel. “We are not at war ” Captain Crozier wrote. “Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now  we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our sailors.” Back at the Pentagon was a furious Mr. Modly  who had moved up from the Navy’s No. 2 job in November after Mr. Esper demanded the resignation of his boss over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL commando whom Mr. Trump had championed. The acting secretary told reporters last week that the Navy was rushing badly needed supplies to the Roosevelt well before the captain sent his letter to several officers in his chain of command over unclassified email. Mr. Modly said the captain had become “overwhelmed” by the crisis  and said he removed him over a loss of confidence — and not retribution for the letter. Navy officials say they do not know who leaked the letter. But in removing from command a captain who complained that the Navy was not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus  the Navy opened itself to criticism that it was insufficiently concerned about the health of its sailors. Even though Mr. Modly stressed that he welcomed blunt assessments from subordinate officers  the removal of Captain Crozier could have a chilling effect  several senior officers said. Online  members of Captain Crozier’s Naval Academy class of 1992 have rallied behind their classmate. Members of the class  most of whom have long since left the military  say their private Facebook group is overflowing with posts and comments in support of the captain. “The volume of posts was almost exponential ” one classmate  Mark Roppolo  said in a telephone interview. Mr. Craig  who served with Captain Crozier  said he sent his friend an email when the coronavirus started spreading in Asia this winter  wishing him well. He said he received a reply saying thank you  but had not spoken to him since he was relieved of command. The two men were picked for the Navy’s demanding nuclear power school together in 2012  and Captain Crozier clearly excelled. “Nuclear power school is a crucible ” Mr. Craig said. “It’s not for the faint of heart. Chopper would stay late  study on weekends  until he could not only pass the tests but had a deep understanding of the concepts behind them.” Mr. Craig said that during his time aboard the Roosevelt in 2015  the command regularly drilled to react to battle damage  fire and other catastrophes  but never practiced what they would do if infectious disease ravaged the tight quarters of the ship. “Chopper always had the best interests of his crew forefront. I’m sure that was the case here ” Mr. Craig said. “Chopper’s character is not prone to hasty or uneducated decision making. Anything he did was well thought out.” Dan Goldenberg  another Naval Academy classmate of Captain Crozier’s  said that “Modly is wrong no matter what.” “He either made the wrong call in firing Crozier  or if he made the right call  he did a terrible job of explaining it — it’s just illogical ” said Mr. Goldenberg  a retired Navy captain and special assistant to four secretaries of the Navy. On Sunday  friends say  Captain Crozier found himself sitting alone in the “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam  battling a coronavirus infection  with an unknown next step in a nearly 30-year military career. The evacuation Captain Crozier sought for his crew is now in motion — one following the rousing send-off they gave him as he left the ship last week. Hundreds of sailors who tested negative have been evacuated from the ship  which is being disinfected with a skeleton crew aboard to operate the nuclear reactors and other critical functions. Quarantined sailors are not allowed to leave their rooms. Their meals are placed on the floor outside their hotel doors three times a day  and alcohol and outside food are not allowed in. These sailors have not even been given keys to their rooms. If they try sneaking out  the doors will lock behind them and they will need a military police officer — one of whom is keeping watch on every floor — to let them back in. They do have access to Wi-Fi and cable television  and are allowed to smoke on their balconies  if their room has one. Twice a day  hospital corpsmen — the Navy’s medics — visit each room and take the sailors’ temperatures  to watch for potential fevers. It is not an ending any of Captain Crozier’s friends and academy classmates envisioned. “Can you imagine devoting your whole life to the Navy as Crozier has  and you make the right call to help your crew  and this happens?” Mr. Goldenberg said. “I’m floored.” Dave Philipps contributed reporting from Colorado Springs.

If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/politics/05dc-virus-military3/05dc-virus-military3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-john-ismay/author-john-ismay-thumbLarge.png 
05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/coronavirus-democrats-republicans-trump.html, us politics, Politics Through the Looking Glass: Virus Scrambles the Left-Right Lines, , Supported by  By Jim Rutenberg The 2020 edition of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill  Md.  in February offered a theme-park version of what was to be President Trump’s re-election message: Under the banner of “America vs. Socialism ” the convention featured anti-Marx branded popcorn  an RV emblazed with the words “Socialism Takes Capitalism Creates” and a children’s book promoting personal freedom and private-property rights. Speeches included tirades against big government and “Medicare for all.” “The virus is not going to sink the American economy ” the president’s chief economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  told a packed auditorium. “What is or could sink the American economy is the socialism coming from our friends on the other side of the aisle.” Mr. Trump  the keynote speaker  proclaimed  “We are defeating the radical  socialist Democrats” who “want total control.” Four weeks later  with the coronavirus sinking the American economy  the federal government was preparing to cut $1 200 checks to tens of millions of citizens  part of a $2 trillion economic stabilization package that was also providing businesses with no-interest loans — likely to be partly forgiven — to pay their employees while they are shuttered. The Trump administration was issuing guidance for Americans to stay inside their homes while weighing a New Deal-style infrastructure program to create jobs. And the CPAC message seemed a relic from a distant time. Such is life for the political warriors of the Covid-19 campaign  where  in this pre-peak stage of the crisis  the national political debate is inside out and upside down  sending both sides of the national divide scurrying to figure out where the new political and ideological lines will settle come the fall. As Republicans prepare for a re-election battle almost certain to hinge on perceptions of the Trump administration’s readiness and efficiency in performing its most solemn duty — to protect American lives — the decades-old debate over government’s role in American life has entered an unfamiliar phase of discombobulation. A president who leads a movement that was galvanized by Ronald Reagan’s motto that the four most terrifying words from the government were “I’m here to help” is now responsible for the largest federal disaster response since the Great Depression. “The era of limited-government  country-club Republicanism is over ” said Stephen K. Bannon  an ideological architect of Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory. At the same time  lingering conservative distrust of government and “experts ” combined with a red-and-blue fissure over the severity of the crisis  have surfaced dystopian national divisions: between those taking social-distancing measures seriously and those who view them as resulting from government overreach  between those who would support a prolonged economic shutdown and those who would be willing to trade additional casualties for a faster return to normalcy. “That ” said Matt Schlapp  chairman of the American Conservative Union  “is one of the questions our politics will solve in November.” In the middle of it all is the president  whose operatic inconsistency about his administration’s role was apparent on Saturday when he predicted “a lot of death” but raised the possibility of relaxed social-distancing guidelines for Easter services. It is so early in the crisis that both sides are navigating public opinion day to day  uncertain whether the fault lines have been truly scrambled or will re-emerge only hardened once the crisis abates  whenever that is. “We don’t know what it’s going to look like on the other side of this in terms of people’s attitudes — whether it’s going to have short-term effects or long-term effects ” said Anita Dunn  a senior adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  the likely Democratic presidential nominee. The sudden  unprecedented nature of the election cycle has made it impossible to strategize too far ahead: The party conventions  where nominees make their strongest cases  are in doubt; traditional retail politicking  necessary for exciting base voters and winning over converts  is impossible  and voting is facing a potential shift toward more mail-only balloting than ever before in a presidential election. With the death count mounting last week  the two sides were sparring over whether Mr. Trump’s early declarations that the virus was contained had cost lives. “He has some great vulnerabilities no matter how many proposals he puts out  and the single greatest one of them is the month of February ” Ms. Dunn said. “The number of people who are sick is significantly greater than it needed to be because this administration didn’t act when it could have — and that is not an issue that is going to go away.” For their part  Trump campaign aides were trying to go on offense  painting Mr. Biden and the Democrats as working to undermine Mr. Trump as he seeks to lead the country through the crisis as a “wartime president.” “In January  while the Democrats were entirely focused on impeachment  President Trump took the critical step of restricting travel from China in response to the coronavirus ” the campaign said in a statement. It criticized Mr. Biden for calling Mr. Trump’s response “xenophobic” and pointed to polls showing approval of Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic. (An ABC News/Ipsos poll on Friday showed his support dipping from an earlier uptick.) Beyond the back and forth is the question that has rested at the heart of American politics since the New Deal: What is the federal government’s appropriate place in managing public welfare and private behavior? Democrats view the crisis as vindicating their long-held belief in “the importance of government and the functions that only a government can do ” as Ms. Dunn put it. Conservatives ascended over the last decade with the anti-government  institutions-skeptical sentiment of the Tea Party  which was itself partly fueled by anger over the bank bailouts and the stimulus measures that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Trump took the White House embracing the movement’s resentment of elites and “experts ” and his administration moved quickly to cut back agencies — including a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program built to detect and manage potential viral outbreaks — as it vowed to end the Affordable Care Act. “Now we’re in a crisis where big government is the only thing that can save us  and elites — a combination of these two things that Republicans say they hate ” said Stuart Stevens  a Republican strategist for the George W. Bush and Mitt Romney campaigns who has soured on his party in the Trump era. So far  Mr. Trump  politically limber to begin with  has sought to have his $2 trillion federal response and eat it  too. He has shared billing on the front of the mailing for “The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America” with the Centers for Disease Control  an agency some of his supporters view as part of the so-called deep state. And he approved the C.D.C. recommendation that all Americans wear masks. Yet he said he would not wear a mask himself. He has praised the government’s lead infectious-disease official  Dr. Anthony Fauci  but dismissed Dr. Fauci’s call for a national stay-at-home order  as some Republican governors resist going along with the C.D.C. guidance. In a sign of the ideological fogginess of the moment  the Trump campaign on Friday argued in an email that Mr. Biden’s plan to add a government-run option to the Affordable Care Act “would end Obamacare as we know it ” as Mr. Trump continues to back a lawsuit seeking to do just that. Guy Cecil  chairman of the major Democratic super PAC Priorities USA  said the administration’s anti-Obamacare position would prove politically punishing as the pandemic wore on. “The fact that the administration is still seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act at a time when more people are being thrown off their health care is only going to become more important ” he said. It was only a few weeks ago that centrist Democrats were openly fretting that Senator Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for all plan and Andrew Yang’s call for a universal basic income would hurt the entire party with swing voters by feeding the Republicans’ “socialism” theme. Now  with the swift bipartisan passage of the $2 trillion stimulus  perhaps only the first of its kind  those fears are subsiding. “It makes it harder to label your opponent a socialist ” said Howard Wolfson  a top strategist for former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York  who ended his presidential bid last month. The moment is not without irony for Mr. Sanders  whose chances to win the nomination have faded as his signature proposals have appeared to gain greater acceptance. A Morning Consult/Politico poll released last week found that Medicare for all had support from 55 percent of registered voters  up nine percentage points from mid-February. “I’d love to see you tell me that you can’t campaign on free treatment now ” said Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager  Faiz Shakir. “Because all of our fates depend on everyone being tested and treated.” With a “Yangwasright” hashtag trending on Twitter  a Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters found nearly 80 percent generally approved of the government’s direct payments to individuals. Mr. Bannon  who left the Trump administration in 2017  saw evidence of a national coming together for measures  like a $15 federal minimum wage  to help “the heroes of this catastrophe” — whom he identified as “the truck drivers  the kids at the Amazon plants  police  doctors and nurses.” He predicted a pandemic-born political realignment in step with his own brand of “economic nationalism ” in which shared resentment over income inequality  corporate greed and global trade policies that gave China so much economic influence in the United States would create a new political coalition drawn from Sanders supporters  working-class Democrats and Republicans. “What we want is a better deal for the little guy — trade barrier protections  high wages and also entrepreneurialism  not corporate capitalism ” he said. Republicans close to the White House argued that the party’s primary tenets were unshakable  even in this crisis. For instance  where Mr. Trump has been hesitant in using the Defense Production Act to compel American factories to produce medical supplies  “Joe Biden and Democrats call for compulsion  which is markedly different ” said Tim Murtaugh  the Trump campaign communications director. Mr. Trump has likened government mandates for manufacturers to nationalization of industry  a line his supporters presumably would not want him to cross. Parts of his political base are chafing at government moves to control social interactions and shutter businesses to fight the virus. With that in mind  Mr. Schlapp  the chairman of the American Conservative Union  which runs CPAC  described the huge aid package as restitution  not socialism. “The conservative principle is when government takes your property and economic rights  they are obligated to come up with a financial settlement ” said Mr. Schlapp  whose wife  Mercedes Schlapp  is a Trump campaign adviser. Conservatives  he said  are less deferential to government than their liberal counterparts and are not likely to put up with it for long  presaging a potentially intense election-year conflict between left and right over when to end social distancing measures. “Eventually  we have to ask ourselves  what’s the appropriate level of risk to open it back up ” Mr. Schlapp said. “It will be a showdown  and I think that will tell us a lot about our country.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.

04/2020/interactive,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-new-orleans-social-distancing.html, 03 us, Portraits From New Orleans: A Close-Knit City Keeping a Safe Distance, , NEW ORLEANS — Since the city started sending text messages urging people to stay at home  I have been waking up around 6:00 each day as my neighbor Owen feeds his chickens. We sit at opposite ends of our shared backyard and drink coffee. Afterward  I wash my hands for 20 seconds  put on my helmet  hang a bandanna around my neck as a makeshift mask  and pack my bag with hand sanitizer and wipes. It has been 23 days since we were first told to practice social distancing  the now-familiar act of staying six feet away from each other to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In a city known for parades and saying hello to your neighbors  the change is stark. On day four  I decided to make portraits of the city from this now significant distance. With my camera over my shoulder  I bike down Canal Street to the French Quarter  passing the Joy Theater. The lettering on the marquee carries a message: “We Love you NOLA  Stay Safe & Wash Your Hands  Be Back Soon.” “Nobody’s ready for this ” Capt. Kenyon Hughes told me while he was working overtime at the fire station on the edge of the Quarter. On Thursday  the number of known coronavirus cases in Louisiana soared past 9 000. Individual sounds once muffled by the hum of the city now echo through deserted streets. I follow the echoes to their source. I hear Barry Botson’s broom sweeping up Basin Street outside the Saenger Theater. Sean Julian closing the door of his FedEx van. The clicking heels of three Tulane students as they walk down a boarded-up Bourbon Street to make graduation portraits. Then  camera in hand and standing six feet away  I introduce myself and ask to photograph those I encounter. Though we are beginning to understand how this disease spreads and what we can do to help prevent it  the isolation and uncertainty make a hard trade. Our daily routines have come to a standstill. Lives feel momentarily frozen. Once crowded  early evening streets now carry the air of dawn. In this new landscape  making portraits also feels changed. No one’s eyes are darting back and forth  conscious of being seen. No drunken revelers stumbling into frame  apologizing  then backing out. No urgency of scheduling (we all have time). There’s an ease to our interaction. This disruption clears the space to connect. After a few mornings in the Quarter  I head out in search of the absence. Where are the musicians? Bartenders? The people who make up this city? When income  along with agency and power  is taken away  what are we left with? Who do we lean on when physical touch is a luxury? At about 5:00 p.m.  Jasmine Araujo rides in the bed of a 1998 Chevy truck as it crisscrosses the Quarter. Beside her are 75 bagged meals and bottles of water that she has prepared for people living on the streets outside — a mutual-aid project like many surfacing across the country. “You need food?” she asks a man walking by. “Yes  please ” he says. “I’ll bring it to you ” she answers. With gloved hands  she places the meal on the ground and steps back. “We want to keep you safe ” she says. He picks it up. Fifteen minutes later  the meals are gone. Biking home down the center of Canal Street  I see a vacant streetcar glowing at dusk. I pass nurses leaving the hospital after a 12-hour shift  where each act of care carries risk. I look at them  wave as I go by. I remind myself that while this new distance prohibits touch  it still allows for eye contact. Brett Anderson contributed reporting.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/asia/nepal-himalayas-glacier-climate.html, world asia, As Himalayas Warm  Nepal’s Climate Migrants Struggle to Survive, Pushed out of their village by a drought and lack of food  a group of Nepalis are fighting to amplify the voices of those forced to relocate by the planet’s warming., Supported by Pushed out of their village by a drought and lack of food  a group of Nepalis are fighting to amplify the voices of those forced to relocate by the planet’s warming. By Bhadra Sharma and Kai Schultz Photographs by Rebecca Conway DHYE  Nepal — High in the Himalayas  on a rugged plateau dotted with empty mud huts  an exodus has begun. In the village of Dhye  crops are stubby  dead stalks. Water is scarce. The only school closed a few years ago. With dwindling food  most families have packed their belongings and left  driven out by a faceless  man-made enemy. They are Nepal’s climate-change migrants  and there will be more. “I love this village ” said Sonam Chhiring Gurung  76  one of the final holdouts  “but I can’t survive here much longer.” Climate change is remaking the Himalayan region  putting at risk millions of South Asians who depend on its water resources and pushing mountain dwellers in northern Nepal  home to the world’s highest peaks  to build new settlements at lower altitudes. Glacial melt has accelerated in the 1 500-mile-long Himalayas. Land once used for growing vegetables has become barren. Yak herders say they are struggling to find grazing patches for their animals. Scientists have found that rising temperatures could spread malaria and dengue to new areas of the Himalayas  where mosquitoes have started to appear in the highlands. Around the world  tens of millions of people have already been displaced as a result of a warming planet. Researchers estimate that the number of climate-change migrants — those fleeing natural disasters  droughts or other calamities — could reach a billion by the end of the century. South Asians are among the most vulnerable. Last year  after an unusually weak monsoon  water nearly ran out in Chennai  one of India’s biggest cities. In Bangladesh  up to 18 million people face displacement by 2050 from sea rise alone  according to the Environmental Justice Foundation. Extreme heat is making people sicker and poorer  and could sharply diminish the living standards of 800 million people in the region if goals for mitigating climate change are not met. Warmer Himalayas could have disastrous consequences for the subcontinent. Last year  in one of the most complete studies on mountain warming  scientists warned that even if the world’s most ambitious climate change targets were met  at least one-third of Himalayan glaciers would melt by the end of the century. If global warming and greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rates  the region could lose two-thirds of its glaciers by 2100  according to the report  the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment. “In the long term  the impacts will be profound for hundreds of millions of people in the plains ” said David Molden  the director general of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Kathmandu. “If we overlay significantly changed rain and river flow patterns  it will be a mess for people depending on Asia’s big rivers for irrigation and drinking water.” In a country where nearly 70 percent of people work in agriculture  an acceleration in extreme weather may “reverse and undermine decades of development gains and potentially undermine all our efforts to eradicate poverty ” said Ayshanie Medagangoda-Labé  the United Nations Development Program’s representative for Nepal. “Nepal is ground zero for the impacts of climate change ” she said. “As a country with one of the most fragile ecosystems — the Himalayas — and an economy that is heavily reliant on favorable climate conditions  Nepal is probably one of the most exposed.” Glimpses of a warmer future are everywhere. In 2016  Nepal’s army drained a lake near Mount Everest after rapid glacial melting threatened to cause a catastrophic flood downstream. A study released last year found that the size of ponds on top of glaciers in the region — which can both signal melting and accelerate it — had rapidly increased over the past three years  far outpacing the rate of change from the first decade and a half of the 2000s. HIMALAYAS CHINA TIBET Dhye MUSTANG MT. EVEREST NEPAL Kathmandu INDIA 100 miles By The New York Times The number of climate change migrants in Nepal’s Himalayas is unknown  though local officials in mountain towns estimate it to be in the thousands. Min Bahadur Shahi  a member of the government’s commission for development work  said officials planned to track the impact of warming temperatures for the first time through coming census questions. “Our first priority should be helping those displaced from the climate crisis ” he said. Take the case of Dhye  in the remote Mustang region of Nepal  about 12 000 feet above sea level. More than a decade ago  the village’s families gathered for a meeting to ponder a heavy question: Should they stay? They looked around their landscape  a brown  dehydrated expanse that could barely sustain barley anymore. They weighed soil degradation  newly erratic rainfall and fears of starvation against centuries of lived history — the huts they had built with their hands  the pockets of earth where parents had buried each newborn’s umbilical cord. By the end of the meeting  17 of 26 families  about 90 people  vowed to leave. “I couldn’t stay ” said Tsering Lamke Gurung  54  a village leader and father of eight  four of whom have died. “My children and I were not able to survive from crop failure.” The leavers have trickled out of Dhye in groups over the past few years. They strapped bundles of food and clothing to their backs and hiked nearly a mile down to the banks of a still-flowing stream. They called their new community Dhye Khola  a local name for the water body. There were some moments of triumph. One resident sent pictures of the uncultivated land to a French aid agency  which agreed to plant fruit trees in the village and help build sturdier concrete homes for families. But the longer-term settlement process was fraught  illustrating the challenges migrants face in procuring resources for unrecognized villages where residents have no legal right to the land. Mr. Gurung  who took the lead in building Dhye Khola  said he approached a former prime minister of Nepal for guidance and aid. He met prominent lawmakers  a Nepal-based leader of the World Wildlife Fund and representatives from foreign embassies. “They didn’t support us ” Mr. Gurung said. “They wouldn’t help us get a land ownership certificate.” When a government conservation group backed away from its promise of providing apple seedlings for Dhye Khola  Mr. Gurung said he marched into its office and threatened to burn it down. He said the group eventually relented and sent about 275 seedlings. “To those who say climate change is fake and criticize us for occupying public land  I ask them to come visit our village ” Mr. Gurung said. “I am a victim of climate change.” Some wondered how long it would take before their next move  pointing out that broader warming trends were impossible to escape. To protect against flooding during the summer monsoon  residents of Dhye Khola have started building embankments near the stream. They strategized about what to do if their apple orchards were marauded by locals from other struggling villages. Tsering Bitik Gurung  52  a farm laborer with a sun-creased face  said the stress was getting to her. Ms. Gurung  who is not related to Tsering Lamke Gurung  agonized over the recent death of her husband from cancer and her diminishing money. The well near her home has gone dry. She cursed local police officers who prevented her from selling wild herbs in one of the bigger cities — retribution  she said  for villagers’ persistent efforts to get Dhye Khola recognized. Sitting next to her stove  Ms. Gurung sighed. The apple orchards are bountiful for now  she said  but “our future is dark.” “We came here after hardship  not for fun ” she said. “I pray that God will save us.” Bhadra Sharma reported from Dhye  and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/us-china-military-funding-virus.html, us politics, U.S. Military Seeks More Funding for Pacific Region After Pandemic, A report delivered to Congress last week called for $20.1 billion in equipment  exercises and defense investments to counter China in 2021 and beyond., Supported by A report delivered to Congress last week called for $20.1 billion in equipment  exercises and defense investments to counter China in 2021 and beyond. By Julian E. Barnes WASHINGTON — United States military officials have outlined a spending request to bolster deterrence against China after the coronavirus pandemic ebbs  a sign of how national security leaders are already studying ways to shore up the country’s standing in the Asia-Pacific region once the outbreak ends. A report from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command  delivered to Congress last week  calls for $20.1 billion in additional spending between 2021 and 2026. The funds would be spent on new radar warning systems and cruise missiles  and would also pay for more exercises with allies  deployments of additional forces and new intelligence-sharing centers. The efforts would help improve the U.S. military’s ability to deter the People’s Liberation Army. The request  which was first reported by Breaking Defense and Defense News  shows that many in the military believe tensions between the United States and China are likely to grow amid the pandemic. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China cut an uneasy peace in late March  each promising to dial back accusations of who was at fault for the spread of the virus  which is believed to have originated late last year at a market in Wuhan. But U.S. intelligence officials have said they expect tensions to flare again  and China to restart its efforts to deflect blame for the virus and spread disinformation about the United States’ role in its origin. While Congress commissioned the report from the Indo-Pacific Command before the coronavirus plunged the world economy into chaos and heightened tensions between the United States and China  current and former national security officials said the spending request was more relevant now. China is sure to use the aftermath of the virus to try to strengthen its hold on the Pacific region  according to lawmakers. But the United States will also have an opportunity to shore up its traditional allies. The pandemic threatens to upend the status quo around the world  particularly in Asia  where the infections began  said Senator Josh Hawley  Republican of Missouri  who has advocated increased military funding for the Pacific region. “China understands that the global pandemic is an inflection point ” Mr. Hawley said. “They are trying to turn this to their advantage. Make no mistake  they are still pursuing their global strategic ambitions. The need for us to laser focus on China’s economic and military ambitions is going to be more urgent once we beat this pandemic  not less.” Some members of Congress and military strategists have long argued that the Pentagon needed to fund a deterrence initiative in Asia  akin to measures in Europe after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began its war with Ukraine. The European funding paid for new military exercises  the deployment of forces to the Baltic States and Poland  and upgrades to logistic facilities  like ports. Among the projects proposed in the report is a series of new intelligence-sharing centers. While the United States has close intelligence ties with New Zealand and Australia  its partnerships with allies in Southeast Asia are more anemic. The new money would create a counterterrorism center  an Oceania fusion center and other intelligence facilities. The spending plan also calls for the United States to build up its missile defenses in Guam and other parts of the so-called second island chain  which is farther east than the first island chain. It would fund radar installations in Hawaii  Palau and other locations to better track hypersonic missile threats. The proposal would fund more offensive weaponry such as Navy Tomahawk missiles. Intermediate-range land-based missiles were once banned by international treaties  but the Trump administration withdrew last year from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  in part to counter a growing threat from China. The move allows the United States to defend Taiwan and other parts of the first island chain. “In order to change the calculus of our adversary  we must deny them the ability to control the air and sea around the first island chain ” the report says. “U.S. forces must be capable of fighting in highly contested environments against technologically advanced opponents.” Members of Congress and military strategists have argued that the threat of missiles from China has shown that the United States needs to better disperse its forces in Asia  which are largely concentrated in South Korea and Japan. Representative Mike Gallagher  Republican of Wisconsin  said in an interview that Iran’s missile strikes on American troops at bases in Iraq show the potential vulnerability of forces fixed in a single location. The United States needed to better defend its outposts in the Pacific  like Guam  with new radar and other military equipment  he said. “This should provide a wake-up call for all Americans to increase defense investments in the Indo-Pacific ” Mr. Gallagher said. “Slogans that the Indo-Pacific is the Pentagon’s top priority will remain just that — slogans — until the Pentagon puts resources behind the command.” The economic destruction from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to put pressure on the defense budget. That will make creating a new pool of funding to build up the U.S. presence in Asia all the more urgent  said Eric Sayers  a former congressional staff member and a senior adviser to the Indo-Pacific Command. Mr. Sayers  who is now a vice president at Beacon Global Strategies  a Washington-based consultancy  has written about the need to increase short-term military spending in the Pacific given Chinese expansion and military activity in the region. “For all the change we should expect in a post-Covid world  the shifting military balance in Asia and the concern it has created for America’s allies will endure ” Mr. Sayers said. “This funding plan for Congress represents a road map for what the nation needs to do to address these operational shortfalls in the Pacific.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/politics/05dc-uschina/merlin_170685045_47aee980-b157-40ce-8505-859ad9f0f68e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-julian-barnes/author-julian-barnes-thumbLarge.png 
05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/coronavirus-elections-democrats.html, us politics, Progressives Built an Organizing Juggernaut for 2020. Then the Virus Hit., After a disappointing turn in the presidential race  grass-roots progressive groups focused on congressional races and down-ballot campaigns. In weeks  the coronavirus has destroyed their plans., Supported by After a disappointing turn in the presidential race  grass-roots progressive groups focused on congressional races and down-ballot campaigns. In weeks  the coronavirus has destroyed their plans. By Astead W. Herndon and Ian Prasad Philbrick When it became clear last month that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would almost certainly win the Democratic nomination  many of the progressive Democrats who supported other presidential candidates were disappointed but not deterred. They quickly shifted their electoral focus to candidates lower on the ballot. The plan was straightforward: They would donate to a slew of insurgent congressional candidates  and a stable of grass-roots groups would be ready and waiting to organize for the general election and beyond. But that was in a pre-pandemic America  before the spread of the coronavirus caused thousands of deaths  about 10 million new unemployment claims in two weeks  and the halting of public events in the presidential race. Now many progressive candidates and the organizations that support them are struggling to adapt to a bleak reality — dried up fund-raising  unclear election dates  and a moratorium on tried-and-true political tactics like in-person phone banks and door-to-door canvassing. “It’s an immediate effect on how we can plan  how we can grow  and even our month-to-month cash flow ” said Amanda Litman  the executive director of Run for Something  one of the many Democratic organizations founded after President Trump’s 2016 victory. “It’s really scary  because the candidates need more support than ever. And political fund-raising right now is plummeting  as is the rest of the economy.” Ms. Litman said her group had already been forced to cancel fund-raising that was expected to bring in nearly $500 000. The coronavirus  she said  has made basic operational questions — including Run for Something’s survival through the November general election — a more open question. There are also political challenges  said Waleed Shahid  a spokesman for Justice Democrats. Insurgent candidates are more likely to rely on door-to-door canvassing and rallies to show enthusiasm  activities that are functionally discontinued until further notice. Progressive candidates also tend to rely exclusively on small-dollar donations  which have experienced a downturn as people tighten their budgets. “Incumbents have certain advantages in a crisis  namely access to the media as a voice of authority ” Mr. Shahid said. The grim picture may have a profound political impact for the general election and beyond. Democrats were poised to have an organizing juggernaut ready for the 2020 election  with the goal of both reaching new voters and helping reverse the state and local losses they experienced during President Barack Obama’s years in power. Even more  liberal groups hoped this election cycle would formalize their political infrastructure  so the activism that erupted in response to Mr. Trump’s election could be harnessed going forward. That may still happen  but it will require creative financial and digital solutions  according to interviews with several leaders of progressive political organizations and left-wing candidates running for office in states like New York and Ohio. Optimists have called it a time for political innovation  while others worry the structural barriers could stymie the progressive movement at a critical crossroads. The outcome is of particular importance because the two most liberal presidential candidates  Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  were surpassed in the primary race by the more moderate Mr. Biden. Ms. Warren ended her presidential bid last month  and Mr. Sanders still says his campaign has a “narrow path” but is facing increased calls from allies to cede the nomination to Mr. Biden. The left-wing Working Families Party had to recall waves of canvassers who were collecting signatures for congressional  state and local candidates endorsed by the group. It has also scrapped multiple in-person initiatives: a volunteer training program that was to begin imminently and a two-day organization-wide convention in Milwaukee that was scheduled for May. On the campaign side  Ohio canceled its primary just one day before voters in the state’s Third Congressional District were set to vote in a Democratic primary between Morgan Harper  a community activist who had previous jobs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and as a corporate lawyer  and Representative Joyce Beatty  an incumbent with a long history in state politics. The state has rescheduled its primary to April 28  but has also mandated that nearly all voters submit ballots by mail  a move Ms. Harper said might depress turnout and give an advantage to candidates with higher name recognition. “People are very stressed about contracting an infectious disease that has the potential to kill you while also dealing with the disruption to financial life right now ” Ms. Harper said. “And in the midst of that  while experiencing extreme financial stress  we’re going to ask them to have the wherewithal to go to a website  request an application  print it out and mail it back in — just to get a ballot.” Suraj Patel  one of several challengers running in New York’s 12th Congressional District against the incumbent Democrat  Representative Carolyn B. Maloney  contracted the coronavirus in March  forcing him into quarantine. The situation disrupted his campaign schedule  though he has been trying to work from home. Mr. Patel said his small dollar fund-raising had dropped off by 80 percent by the end of March. “No doubt fund-raising is way  way  way down ” Mr. Patel said. “And it’s difficult to even ask people to give when most of them are either furloughed or at home or uncertain of what’s going to happen.” There have been some silver linings for progressive candidates. Ms. Harper and Mr. Patel have ramped up digital contact with voters and repurposed campaign tools to provide information about coronavirus safety. Jamaal Bowman  a progressive who is mounting a campaign against the stalwart incumbent Representative Eliot L. Engel in New York’s 16th Congressional District  pivoted to an online-only operation in a matter of days  said his campaign manager  Luke Hayes. “One of the things about having such a broad base of small donors is that while asking them for that recurring donation of 10 dollars a month  you cultivate a relationship with them ” Mr. Hayes said. “I think some incumbents  you know  they just expect kind of checks brought in just based on their stature.” Just as in the business world  where new digital tools have exploded in use  fresh political technology is also helping to fill gaps. Outvote  a political start-up in Boston that allows users to send voting and other political information to people in their social networks  has seen a rise in interest from progressive campaigns and causes as the pandemic spreads. Some have begun using Outvote to disseminate information about how to guard against the virus  said Naseem Makiya  the company’s founder. On Thursday  the Progressive Turnout Project  a political action committee that supports liberal candidates  announced a nearly $3 million investment in phone banking that aims to leverage up to 12 million calls from volunteers to lower-propensity Democratic voters before Election Day in November. “The more impersonal the mode  the less effective you’re going to get ” said Alex Morgan  the group’s executive director. “So while it is great that a bunch of groups are hopping onto text messages and digital  that’s more distant than you and I having a conversation right now.” But progressives are also hoping that their message of big ideas has a new resonance in this moment of crisis. In interviews  group leaders said they were confident the pandemic had strengthened their calls for systemic change by exposing cracks in the country’s economy and health care system. Ms. Litman said Run for Something  even with looming financial questions  had seen interest from prospective local candidates hold steady throughout March. Rahna Epting  the executive director of the progressive group MoveOn  said its membership had grown by more than one million in March. “What we’re seeing is that the energy that normally we would funnel into physical protests and physical action  the energy is there and it’s growing exponentially ” she said. On Sunday  the Working Families Party held its first digital rally  with appearances from the Rev. William J. Barber II and Stacey Abrams  who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia in 2018 and now leads the voting rights group Fair Fight Action. Working Families plans to hold its May convention remotely. “You know  it took me some time to get my parents FaceTiming with me in a way that made sense ” said Maurice Mitchell  the national director of Working Families. “And I think that’s happening on a broader level where people have different fluency with different types of technology. We’re all kind of learning together.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

He died of the coronavirus., Supported by those we’ve lost His and Gerhard Kallmann’s sculptural and public-minded design for Boston helped spur the cityscape’s revival in the late 1960s. He died of the coronavirus. By Joseph Giovannini This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Michael McKinnell  whose heroically sculptural and democratically open design for Boston City Hall catalyzed the city’s urban revival in the late 1960s and embodied the era’s idealism and civic activism  died on March 27 in Beverly  Mass. He was 84. His wife and architectural partner  Stephanie Mallis  said the cause was the coronavirus. In 1962  the British-born Mr. McKinnell was a 26-year-old graduate student in architecture at Columbia University working as a teaching assistant to the German-born architect Gerhard Kallmann when  almost on a lark  the two entered a competition to design a new Boston City Hall. Vying with 255 other submissions  they won. “They were as amazed as anyone that they prevailed ” Ms. Mallis said. Neither had ever built anything. Except for fellow architects  few Americans had seen anything quite like the winning proposal — certainly not the city’s mayor  John F. Collins  who reportedly exclaimed on first seeing the design  “What the [expletive] is that?” It wasn’t the proper government structure of Boston’s staid red-brick tradition; rather  it was a proudly monumental building that would command the vast plaza of the new Government Center complex with thunderous authority. What Mayor Collins saw was the exposed musculature of mighty concrete piers supporting a massive cornice line of offices. The building was to stand at the edge of a fanning plaza whose bricks entered the ground floor of the structure like a carpet  running up three flights to the City Council chambers. Spaces and forms interpenetrated. Sculptural concrete projections that housed the chambers and the mayor’s office protruded from a modular facade of offices. A brick amphitheater of stairs on the ground floor accommodated gatherings of citizens  even spontaneous sit-ins; the vast plaza in front  inspired by the Campo of Siena  Italy  anticipated the thousands of protesters of those riotous times. It was a benevolent structure that took the side of the people  guaranteeing citizens free access through porous perimeters in that cradle of American democracy. Twenty years Mr. McKinnell’s senior  Mr. Kallmann was best known for publishing an essay about two divergent trends in architecture: one in which buildings were composed rigorously within a controlling grid; the other  propelled by French and British Brutalists  in which designs in concrete embraced sometimes violent breakout forms. The Kallmann-McKinnell design synthesized the two approaches  the rational and the complex. Both men had been educated in British architecture schools that taught that architecture’s mission was to build well in the service of a moral and social purpose. And both had been imbued with the belief that concrete was  as one theorist said  “the stone of our time.” Built in concrete and brick  their robust City Hall design implicitly critiqued the thin commercial glass-and-steel buildings then chilling cities across America. It was a statement of protest against what Mr. McKinnell called the “degenerate frippery and surface concerns” of “cosmetic” architecture. Its deliberate monumentality expressed a generosity toward the public rather than a corporate idea of minimal expense  and its exposed concrete surfaces gave the building a sense of authenticity — an “all thoroughness ” Mr. McKinnell said in an interview  admitting that had they had their way  “we would have used concrete to make the light switches.” Like the Sydney Opera House  the structure landed on postcards  the two men’s design becoming a symbol of the new Boston. And though it proved controversial with some members of the public  who found the rugged materials and bold forms confrontational  it was  for most architects and critics  the masterpiece that would hover over the rest of Mr. McKinnell’s nearly 60-year career. The two architects quickly won a half-dozen commissions to design a series of buildings in and around Boston  all built in concrete. Both received appointments to the faculty of Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. Their careers were inextricably linked. They even sat opposite each other at a partners desk  passing drawings back and forth as they conceptualized and developed projects. Mr. Kallmann was more the theorist: He talked about architecture. Mr. McKinnell was interested in materials  in how parts fit: He talked about the building. He always carried a six-inch ruler in his pocket  explaining that architecture was about measure and scaling the building to the human body. Their emphasis on constructional rigor would earn Mr. Kallmann and Mr. McKinnell the sobriquet “Column and Mechanical” in one of their Harvard classes. But by 1974  as concrete grew unpopular and a national recession took hold  Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Kallmann found themselves out of work  waiting for the phone to ring in a garret office on Tremont Street overlooking Boston Common. They thought of returning to England. At the same time  the softer architectural blandishments of postmodernism  promising the comforts of architectural history and tradition  were challenging modernists. In 1978  the second act for Kallmann McKinnell & Wood  as their firm was then called  arrived in the form of a commission for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  to be built on a hill in residential Cambridge  Mass. Its directors told the architects  “Not one square inch of concrete  inside or out.” The commission was for a house for academics  a grove of academia  and having learned the lesson of survival — that they should design not for an audience of architects but for clients and the public — Mr. Kallmann and Mr. McKinnell embarked in a new direction that would last the rest of their careers. Mr. Kallmann died in 2012. They built the Academy with a sloping roof  like the houses around it  and they consulted history books to evoke the turn-of-the-20th-century architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright  the brothers Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene  and others who used natural materials like wood and stone. For the Academy  City Hall’s arresting vertical lines were tranquilized into calming horizontals. And Mr. McKinnell relaxed the interiors  realizing that a space for artists  philosophers and historians needed to have “talking places” — nooks and crannies for informal conversation. The critic Ada Louise Huxtable of The New York Times wrote approvingly of the project. “The architects have felt free to find their answers in terms of existing building types and historical precedents ” she wrote  “rather than through the invention of new forms. The design goes beyond modernism.” But it was a period of style wars in architecture  and modernists believed Mr. McKinnell and Mr. Kallmann had stepped onto a slippery architectural slope. Indeed  years of postmodernist buildings followed in their portfolio  designs that indulged historicism and traditions less probingly than in the Academy building. “Yes  it was possible to have the rigor and systematic nature of modernism together with some symbolic and representational elements ” Andrea Leers  a friend and teaching colleague of Mr. McKinnell’s  said in an interview. “But to most of us  it was a kind of capitulation.” If the firm lost the attention of modernists  it gained the support of a larger audience  and Kallmann McKinnell & Wood went on to add scores of employees and to attract commissions to design embassies  academic buildings and museums around the world. Noel Michael McKinnell was born on Dec. 25  1935  in Salford  Manchester  England  to Ronald and Marguerite McKinnell. His father was an accountant who had fought in both world wars; his mother was a homemaker. Mr. McKinnell’s marriage to Jane D’Espo in 1961 ended in divorce. Besides Ms. Mallis  whom he married in 2003  he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage  Caitlin McKinnell and Phoebe McKinnell; a sister  Sheila Sharman; and four grandchildren. After Mr. McKinnell left his firm several years ago and moved to Rockport  Mass.  he and Ms. Mallis continued to design buildings  completing institutional projects in Israel. They also both painted. He remained the dedicated architect and builder even on his deathbed. After he refused life support in the hospital in Beverly  he spoke by telephone with his wife  herself isolated at home because of the coronavirus. He described to her the design for a grave site  to be created in their backyard garden in Rockport overlooking the sea. It would be a simple square of white roses  his favorite flower  planted in a lower terrace on an axis with another flower bed on the upper one. As he described it  she drew the design. The gravestone itself  carved with both their names  would be granite  not concrete. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

He died of complications of the coronavirus., Supported by He was born without toes on his right foot  but spent 11 seasons in the N.F.L. and kicked 159 field goals. He died of complications of the coronavirus. By Richard Goldstein This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Tom Dempsey  who was born without toes on his right foot or fingers on his right hand but played for 11 N.F.L. seasons as a place-kicker and was remembered for his game-winning  63-yard field goal for the New Orleans Saints on Nov. 8  1970  a league record at the time  died on Saturday at an assisted living center in New Orleans. He was 73. His wife  Carlene  said the cause was complications of the coronavirus  which he contracted on March 25 at the Lambeth House center  where he had been treated for dementia that was diagnosed in 2010. At 6 feet 2 inches and 255 pounds  Dempsey relished running downfield to deliver hits to cover his kickoffs and had sustained several concussions  his family told The New York Times in 2013. The Saints’ opponents on the day Dempsey set the record  the Detroit Lions  were laughing on the sidelines at Tulane Stadium at the absurd notion that he could connect as he prepared for what became his astonishing kick. Seconds later the Lions had been defeated  19-17. “I was more concerned about kicking it straight because I felt I could handle the distance ” Dempsey told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans afterward. He said he had received a perfect snap and hold and “I hit it sweet.” Dempsey’s 63-yarder was later matched by three other kickers but wasn’t exceeded until the Denver Broncos’ Matt Prater kicked a 64-yarder in 2013 in the thin air of the Rocky Mountains  setting a mark that still stands. Dempsey hit 22 field goals in 41 attempts as a rookie in 1969  when he was voted to the Pro Bowl  and succeeded on 18 of 34 tries in 1970. But he was cut before the 1971 season after faring poorly in exhibition games. He went on to play with the Eagles  the Los Angeles Rams  the Houston Oilers and the Buffalo Bills  though he never regained the form he displayed with the Saints. He retired after the 1979 season with 159 field goals in 258 tries and 252 extra points on 282 attempts. Thomas John Dempsey was born on Jan. 12  1947  in Milwaukee and grew up in Southern California. His father  Huey  was a mechanic for a public utility company and joined with his mother  LaVerne (Sorce) Dempsey  in owning a jewelry store in Encinitas. He was a defensive lineman and kicker in high school  played briefly at Palomar College in San Diego County and was signed by the Saints as an undrafted player. After retiring from football  he worked as an oil field salesman in Louisiana until the late 1980s and ran a car dealership owned by the Saints’ owner  Tom Benson. In addition to his wife  Dempsey is survived by his daughters Ashley Dempsey and Meghan Dempsey Crosby; his son  Toby; his sister Janice MacArthur and three grandchildren.  Dempsey loved New Orleans nightlife. He and Carlene were dating at the time of the 63-yard kick. “He courted me mainly at the Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street ” she told The Times in 2013  recalling that she did not hear from him for days after his stunning field goal. “It was Thursday before he called me ” she said  adding that Tom explained that some New Orleans police officers had rewarded him with a couple of cases of cold Dixie beer in the locker room after the game  and it became a long night of celebrating. Carlene married him two months later. Dempsey had a custom shoe that featured a flattened and enlarged toe surface. The shoe he was wearing for his epic kick is held by the Saints at their Hall of Fame; another of his special shoes is at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton  Ohio. Dempsey’s 63-yard field goal came on a straight-on stance at a time when soccer-style kicking was arriving. At the time  Tex Schramm  then the president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys  complained that Dempsey’s misshapen foot with his special shoe gave him an unfair advantage in making contact with the ball. The N.F.L. added a rule in 1977 stating that “any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.” In response  Dempsey  as quoted on the Saints’ website  once said: “Unfair  eh? How about you try kicking a 63-yard field goal to win it with two seconds left and you’re wearing a square shoe. Oh yeah  and no toes either.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/technology/coronavirus-amazon-workers.html, technology, Gaps in Amazon’s Response as Virus Spreads to More Than 50 Warehouses, Shifting sick-leave policy and communication issues are causing employees to assert themselves after they stayed on the job., Supported by Shifting sick-leave policy and communication issues are causing employees to assert themselves after they stayed on the job. By Karen Weise and Kate Conger SEATTLE — Jonathan Bailey  a 30-year-old Amazon warehouse employee in Queens  has a system for protecting himself from the coronavirus at work. He wears a medical mask with a bandanna tied over it. When he returns to the apartment he shares with his wife  he dumps his mask  work gloves  neon green Amazon safety vest and other clothes into a plastic trash bag. He’s not certain it really works  but he figures it’s better than nothing. “We’re very careful ” Mr. Bailey said. “We’re in the epicenter of it all.” As millions of Americans heed government orders to hunker down  ordering food and medicines and books and puzzle boards for home delivery  many of Amazon’s 400 000 warehouse workers have stayed on the job  fulfilling the crushing demands of a country suddenly working and learning from home. Orders for Amazon groceries  for example  have been as much as 50 times higher than normal  according to a person with direct knowledge of the business. The challenge is keeping enough people on the job to fill those orders  according to more than 30 Amazon warehouse workers and current and former corporate employees who spoke with The New York Times. (Many requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly and feared losing their jobs.) For all of its high-tech sophistication  Amazon’s vast e-commerce business is dependent on an army of workers operating in warehouses they now fear are contaminated with the coronavirus. “None of this works without our employees ” said Jay Carney  the company’s senior vice president for corporate affairs. And the employees have been motivated to remind Amazon of their importance. The surge of orders is testing the limits of Amazon’s vaunted distribution system and forcing changes to the company’s relationship with its employees. While Amazon’s workers are not unionized  the crisis has given workplace organizers like Mr. Bailey unexpected leverage to demand better pay  better sick leave and more of a voice in how the company is run. By mid-March  attendance at Amazon warehouses had fallen as much as 30 percent  according to one corporate employee involved in the response. This week  small groups of employees protested working conditions in Michigan and on Staten Island. New York State and New York City officials also said they were investigating whether Amazon improperly retaliated against a worker it fired who had been involved in the protest. Amazon said that it did not fire employees for speaking out about their workplace conditions and that it had fired the worker because he was on paid quarantine and violated safety measures by going to the on-site protest. But in a leaked memo published Thursday by Vice  Amazon’s top lawyer called the fired worker inarticulate and discussed strategy for making him out to be the face of the worker movement. David Zapolsky  the general counsel  said he had been frustrated by what he called a safety violation. “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me ” he said. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker  both of New Jersey  recently wrote to Amazon’s chief executive  Jeff Bezos  to express concern about warehouse safety. The senators  all Democrats  condemned Mr. Zapolsky’s remarks in statements to The Times. “It’s troubling  racist and has no place in our country ” Mr. Menendez said. “Amazon should do everything it can to protect its workers instead of disparaging them.” Amazon said that at the time he made the comments  Mr. Zapolsky was not aware that the fired worker was black. Amazon’s response to the pandemic has differed from warehouse to warehouse. Over the years  that sort of autonomy has allowed Amazon to nimbly adjust to local market conditions. Now it is leading to distrust  as workers see some facilities close for cleaning while others remain open. Since the first worker in the Queens facility learned on March 18 that he had tested positive  the company has learned of cases in more than 50 other facilities  out of the more than 500 it operates across the country. In recent weeks  Amazon has raised wages and added quarantine leave  and it is offering overtime at double pay. It said it had tripled its janitorial staff. And it has added space between many workstations. But in private groups  conversations with their managers and public protests  some workers have expressed alarm about their safety. Mr. Carney said the company had been cautious about telling workers about cases out of privacy concerns and because one of its first likely cases  a corporate employee in Europe  turned out not to have the virus. He said Amazon was managing the needs of its workers and the public the best it could in a situation for which no company has a real playbook. “We’re pushing out these new rules as we decide on them ” Mr. Carney said. But some warehouses acted more rapidly on the policies than others. “Compliance has been unbelievably good but not perfect ” he said. On Thursday  Amazon announced that it would audit warehouses’ compliance with the rules. For Amazon  like many companies in America  the danger of the coronavirus started as a problem in its supply chain. The company was concerned about acquiring products that were made in China  and by mid-February  it was placing larger orders than normal to stockpile supplies. But on Feb. 27  Amazon learned that an employee in Europe who had traveled to Milan had contracted the virus. It immediately halted all nonessential travel  including within the United States  making it the first known major company to suspend domestic travel. In the first week of March  Amazon told its headquarters employees to work from home. Warehouse employees were later offered unlimited unpaid time off instead. Workers would normally be fired after missing too many shifts  so Mr. Carney said the message that executives hoped to convey with the new policy was: “You won’t lose your job  don’t worry.” Many workers did stay home  just as panic buying set in — first for masks and hand sanitizer  then toilet paper and eventually webcams. Eric Heller  a former Amazon senior manager who advises major brands at Wunderman Thompson Commerce  said his clients saw canned meat sales rise 700 percent. Pet food went up 300 percent. Companies began sending in products to restock Amazon’s warehouses. But with attendance down and more items coming in  workers could not replenish the supplies fast enough. Trucks backed up  waiting days to be unloaded. The company offered shift after extra shift  raised wages $2 an hour and paid double the hourly rate for overtime. It eventually announced that it would hire 100 000 new workers. In mid-March  Amazon stopped accepting new shipments into its warehouses that were not for priority products  like health care and baby supplies. On March 16  Jeysson Manrique  an employee of a delivery company that contracts with Amazon  woke up with a fever. His body ached. He called his supervisor to say he was sick. Mr. Manrique  29  was asked to text a picture of his temperature on a thermometer. He couldn’t find one  so he went in for his shift at an Amazon facility in Queens. Amazon said it was investigating the situation with the contracting company because its policy requires employees stay home if they feel sick. Two days later  Mr. Manrique’s father-in-law — they live together in a house with other members of the family — was sorting packages at the same facility when his doctor called to tell him that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. His father-in-law shared his test results with his supervisors and went home. When the warehouse closed for cleaning  he was the first publicly known case inside Amazon’s vast warehouse operations in the United States. Mr. Manrique joined his father-in-law and other members of the household in quarantine without venturing out for a test. On March 23  rumors circulated at the Queens facility that another employee had tested positive. Hours later  there were whispers of a third. The building was shut down March 24 and March 25 for deep cleaning. The company had also begun instructing warehouses to keep employees apart  staggering when they arrive and canceling group meetings at the start of shifts. Some workers said they were still handling products that were helpful but hardly critical. One warehouse employee posted a picture on social media of moving large boxes  including a Power Wheels Jeep that a child can ride  with the hashtags #SoManyPingPongTables and #TreadmillsAreEssentialProductsApparently. Ira Pollock  an employee in the Queens facility who has organized other workers  said having people show up to ship nonessential items endangered the community. “Amazon has to earn its right to call itself an essential service ” he said. “The priorities are the priorities ” Mr. Carney said. “We’re not going to ship a prom dress or a Ping-Pong table if that’s going to slow down in any way the intake or outflow of essential items.” When Amazon announced unlimited unpaid leave  it also said it would pay two weeks of sick time for “all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine.” On Friday  a day after it received questions from The Times about the situation  Amazon said it had issued a check for Mr. Manrique’s father-in-law  who is ending his second week of quarantine. Documents viewed by The Times show that workers around the country applied for leave without a formal diagnosis. The workers said they had compromised immune systems or had been ordered to stay home because of contact with someone who was sick  but did not have the paperwork required to qualify for paid time off. In a number of cases  employees continued to work after showing symptoms but before their tests came back positive — when they would be eligible for paid leave. One person in New York started having symptoms on March 18 but did not stop working until March 25  when she went into quarantine  the documents show. Amazon said workers could still use unlimited unpaid or regular paid sick time off  if they had accrued enough hours. “Paid leave is important ” said Dr. David Michaels  a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration who teaches at George Washington University  “because you need to do everything you can to ensure that potentially sick workers stay home in order not to infect co-workers and others in the public.” On March 25  the attorneys general in 14 states and Washington  D.C.  wrote a letter to Amazon saying the requirement for testing or a formal quarantine was “particularly insufficient given the realities of the public health crisis  where the lack of access to Covid-19 testing has been widely reported.” Two days later  Amazon expanded its policy. Mr. Carney said the leave policy had been developed at a time when Amazon expected testing to be widely available. “When it became clear that the complete scarcity of tests was an obstacle to people finding out whether or not they had Covid  we made it clear that the additional paid time off applied to people who had suspected they had Covid ” he said. But the message has not reached everyone. The internal website for warehouse employees has not been updated  and on Monday  a warehouse employee in the South asked for paid leave after her child tested positive. In an email viewed by The Times  the employee was told to take unpaid time off “as you wait for test results.” While Amazon said it could not confirm the situation  it added that that response did not reflect its policy and that any employee caring for someone with a doctor-diagnosed case of Covid-19 should receive up to two weeks of pay.

But Quibi is still going live., Supported by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman had to cancel a starry Hollywood party for their short-video platform because of the virus. But Quibi is still going live. By Nicole Sperling LOS ANGELES — They had to cancel the premiere party. But Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman have stuck with the April 6 start date of Quibi  the short-form video app for smartphones that they hope will attract millions of subscribers. After having led some of the nation’s top companies for decades  the two veteran executives have spent the last two years in start-up mode  prodding investors to kick in nearly $1.8 billion while courting producers and stars like Jennifer Lopez  LeBron James  Chance the Rapper  Idris Elba  Bill Murray  Steven Spielberg and Chrissy Teigen. Now Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman are ready to unveil their ambitious venture right in the middle of a pandemic. “This is either going to be a massive home run or a massive swing and miss ” said Michael Goodman  a media analyst at Strategy Analytics. Quibi  a portmanteau of “quick bites ” will offer movies  reality shows and news programs made for the smartphone  with no installment clocking in at more than 10 minutes. The offerings fall into three main categories: movies that will be released in chapters; documentaries and unscripted reality shows; and quick-hit news and sports reports from NBC  BBC  ESPN and others. Fifty shows will be available Monday. Before the spread of the coronavirus  whenever Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman made their Quibi pitch  they described it as an on-the-go diversion for anyone standing in line at Starbucks or riding the subway. The pandemic changed the context. With potential customers largely confined to their homes  it will now go up against established platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video that can be watched on any screen  including the living room TV. Quibi works only on the phone. Ms. Whitman said she wasn’t concerned about the crisis’s effect on the start-up’s chances. “Think about how often you use your phone when you’re homebound ” she said. “People who are home with their children would really like a 10-minute break.” There is also the question of how much people are willing to spend on streaming at a time when nearly 10 million are out of work. Entertainment options have also expanded while Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman were building their app with 267 employees in an open-floor office in Hollywood. The Walt Disney Company and Apple joined the streaming party in November  with Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus  and TikTok  filled with short homemade videos  had a spectacular rise  hypnotizing the young viewers Quibi hopes to attract. Under those circumstances  Quibi (rhymes with “libby”) announced last month that it would be free for its first three months. After that  the cost will be $5 a month with ads and $8 without. Shortly after the announcement of the introductory offer  the company canceled its premiere party  which was expected to draw 150 celebrities among its 1 500 guests  because of the pandemic. But delay the launch? No way. “Given the quality and quantity and convenience of Quibi  we think it comes at a time when people are looking for relief  looking for distraction and looking to escape ” Mr. Katzenberg said. “Those are all the things we are trying to deliver to them.” Mr. Katzenberg  69  and Ms. Whitman  63  have dived headlong into a challenging third act  creating a product geared to people half their age at a time when millennials and Gen Z-ers have taken to needling their elders (see “OK Boomer”). The head of Walt Disney Studios at the time of the original version of “The Lion King ” Mr. Katzenberg has often gone against the grain. Passed over for the No. 2 job at Disney in 1994  he built a rival conglomerate  DreamWorks SKG  with Mr. Spielberg and David Geffen. He also waged a legal battle against his former employer  saying he had deserved more compensation. The bitter  headline-generating fight concluded with Disney handing him a settlement estimated at $250 million. DreamWorks faded  but DreamWorks Animation  the spinoff run by Mr. Katzenberg  survived until 2016  when Comcast’s NBCUniversal bought it for $3.8 billion. As part of the deal  Mr. Katzenberg received a $420 million payout — and reluctantly stepped aside. In the back of his mind was a failed initiative similar to Quibi: Pop.com  a side venture he had started in 1999 with Mr. Spielberg  Brian Grazer and Ron Howard as a venue for video shorts. It went bust before it even launched. Quibi’s other leader  one of the country’s most powerful female executives  rose through the ranks of American business at Disney  DreamWorks and Hasbro before she took eBay from a shop with a staff of 30 to a global powerhouse with 15 000 workers and $8 billion in annual revenue. When she left  in 2008  she was a billionaire. She went on to spend more than $100 million of her fortune to run as a Republican for governor of California  only to lose the 2010 election to Jerry Brown. A return to business put her in charge of Hewlett-Packard  which she left in 2017. “I’ve been working straight for 35 years ” she said upon her departure. “I’m going to enjoy some downtime.” But she soon joined Mr. Katzenberg at what was then called New TV  and they started bringing in money from Hollywood studios  the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and other investors. “She doesn’t like this  but I keep saying we’re two old dogs who have a new trick ” Mr. Katzenberg said at the time. Ms. Whitman left her home in Northern California for a West Hollywood high-rise. Now she can see Mr. Katzenberg’s house in Beverly Hills from her bedroom window. Start-ups rarely run smoothly  and several prominent executives have left Quibi over the last year  including Janice Min  the former co-president of The Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group; Diane Nelson  a former Warner Bros. executive; and Tim Connolly  a former Hulu executive. Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman are known as exacting managers who keep an eye on the tiniest detail. The company has also had trouble getting the word out. Although Quibi spent millions on commercials that ran during the Super Bowl and the Oscars  68 percent of participants in a Morning Consult/Hollywood Reporter poll last month said they were not familiar with the brand. “Part of the reason awareness is so low is they are building a new name ” said Ross Benes  a video analyst at eMarketer. “Quibi takes time to explain. It’s not super clear that this will cost you $5 a month and you’ll get a lot of short videos.” Stay-at-home mandates have complicated the rollout  with meetings held via video conference. “Even though Zoom is great  I can’t really read the body language in the room ” Ms. Whitman said. “And that has always been an important part of how I gauge who is doing what to whom and how things are working.” Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman had an easy time making deals partly because of the terms they offer: The company pays for production costs and licensing rights  allowing the creators of Quibi programs to retain copyright  meaning they can sell their work to another platform or network after a set number of years. Nicole Clemens  the president of Paramount Television  received an offer from Quibi for “When the Streetlights Go On ” a script about the aftermath of the murder of a suburban teenager that had once been shot as a Hulu pilot. “It was an incoming call ” Ms. Clemens said  “which is always nice to get.” The Quibi version will be part of the Monday launch. Writers who sign on have to follow a rule of Mr. Katzenberg’s: They must end each installment with a cliffhanger. Nick Santora  the writer of “Most Dangerous Game ” an action film starring Liam Hemsworth and Christoph Waltz  described hitting those marks as “hard but exhilarating.” To pull it off  he refashioned his 48-page pilot script  initially written for NBC  into a 150-page screenplay with a climax every 10 pages. “When you’re writing a regular script  and you need a scene to tell a certain arc in your story  and it takes 12  13 pages  it’s no big deal ” he said. “You can’t do that in Quibi. Once you get to page 10  you’re done.” Quibi intends to set itself apart from YouTube  the leader in short-form digital video  because of its reliance on an old-fashioned Hollywood hallmark: production values. Quibi films cost up to $100 000 per minute. And Mr. Katzenberg’s long experience has taught him how to handle the talent  even as his reputation as a relentless boss holds firm. “You don’t always hear from the biggest exec at the company ” said Ryan Case  the director of “Flipped ” a comedy starring Will Forte and Kaitlin Olson. “But he called me  the writers and the cast members on a Saturday at our homes to say he was excited. It was both wonderful and classy.” Unlike Disney Plus  which gained subscribers on the strength of its “Star Wars” series  “The Mandalorian ” Quibi hopes to lure viewers with its overall lineup. “I think we have fantastic shows ” Ms. Whitman said  “but I also think it’s the sum total of what we are offering  as opposed to one ‘Mandalorian.’” The companies making a line of Quibi programming called Daily Essentials have faced the toughest challenge. Madeleine Haeringer  an NBC News executive producer  spent months assembling a 50-person team able to produce twice-daily 5- to 7-minute news programs. Her job got trickier when employees were forced to work from home. A week before the start date  she delivered test episodes remotely  with anchors on iPads. “It’s incredibly daunting ” Ms. Haeringer said. Quibi’s unscripted shows bring to mind cable fare and syndicated programs. Ms. Teigen’s “Chrissy’s Court” is the app’s answer to “Judge Judy ” and Ms. Lopez produces a show that follows celebrities as they give $100 000 to someone who meant a lot to them. Will Quibi be the next digital thing or a flop? That is the $1.8 billion question. “On the plus side  Quibi is like nothing else ” said Mr. Goodman  the media analyst. “On the other hand  while we know that there is a tremendous amount of video being consumed on phones  we also know that people don’t want to pay for video on their phones.” Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman say they will beat the odds. Noting Quibi’s debut slate of movies in chapters  Mr. Katzenberg said  “All five of those I think are great. Not good. Great.” Ms. Whitman sounded more circumspect. “This is very different from a movie launch ” she said. “We are building a new consumer product.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/business/00JPQUIBI-print/merlin_166845672_80de5497-9514-4a6f-9f3a-64c0b19ef4f6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/sports/basketball/terrace-house-rui-hachimura.html, sports basketball, For This N.B.A. Rookie  Reality TV Is an Escape That Feels Like Home, Rui Hachimura  a Washington Wizards forward  has found comfort and meaning in the hit Japanese reality show “Terrace House.”, Supported by Rui Hachimura  a Washington Wizards forward  has found comfort and meaning in the hit Japanese reality show “Terrace House.” By Scott Cacciola Long before he began feeding his obsession and even found himself sitting next to its hosts  Rui Hachimura didn’t understand all the fuss about the Japanese reality television show “Terrace House.” His high school teammates in Japan had tried hard to get him on board. “I was the only one who was like  ‘Nah ’” said Hachimura  a rookie forward for the Washington Wizards. “But then I started to watch it and it was like  ‘Oh  OK.’” Soon enough  Hachimura became infatuated with “Terrace House ” which chronicles the (often humdrum) day-to-day routines of several strangers who agree to live together. After Hachimura moved to the United States in 2016 to play basketball at Gonzaga  one of his tutors figured out how to motivate him to study: Let him watch an episode after he had completed his schoolwork. For a homesick teenager  the show was bliss. “When I’m watching the show ” Hachimura said  “I can forget everything.” That has never been as true as it is now. Stuck at home like so many others as the coronavirus pandemic continues its spread  Hachimura  22  has occupied himself by working out  playing video games  filming a public-service announcement for the World Health Organization and watching more “Terrace House” than even he thought was humanly possible. “It’s helping me relieve some stress ” he said  adding: “I’m ‘Terrace House’ for life.” In one sense  Hachimura’s own life had already turned into a reality show before the Wizards selected him with the ninth pick in last year’s N.B.A. draft. As the first Japanese-born player to go in the first round  Hachimura was trailed by about a dozen reporters from Japanese media outlets whenever he appeared in uniform before the N.B.A. suspended its season on March 11. For an athlete who has gotten used to operating as the focus of everyone else’s attention — “It feels like I always have cameras on me ” Hachimura said — “Terrace House” has long been a welcome reversal  offering him the chance to peek into other people’s lives for a change. Now  it is even more of a diversion — and a reminder of the way things were before the onset of the pandemic. There have been five seasons of “Terrace House ” which debuted on Japanese television in 2012 and now streams to a global audience on Netflix. Even before Hachimura’s rookie season came to an abrupt halt — he was averaging 13.4 points and six rebounds a game — he had watched each season of the show multiple times  including no fewer than six rewatches of all 36 episodes of his favorite season  “Terrace House: Aloha State ” which was based in Hawaii. That works out to more than 120 hours of watching other people eat their meals  clean their bathrooms and chat about their crushes. A group of widely known television and film personalities host the show  introducing each episode and providing occasional commentary from a set designed to look like a living room. “It’s so different than other reality shows ” Hachimura said. “It’s the one reality show where everything is actually real.” On certain American reality shows  cast members launch themselves into amorous adventures almost as soon as they unpack their bags. Hachimura acknowledged that he was an avid viewer of “Ex on the Beach ” an MTV series that features stars from other reality shows living together with their exes on — you guessed it — the beach. “On the shows over here  they want to be crazy ” Hachimura said. “Terrace House ” though  tends to have a different aesthetic — a slower  more contemplative unspooling of relationships that is reflective of Japanese society  Hachimura said. Consider that through the first 24 episodes of the current season  which is based in Tokyo  none of the cast members had so much as smooched. Entire episodes hinge on the communal anxiety of asking love interests on dinner dates. A carpenter will show up to do some work on the porch and offer sage advice to cast members about the “quest for self-improvement.” It was not until the ninth episode that anyone argued  and that exchange — while heated — was still more civil than a presidential debate. One cast member  a fitness instructor named Risako Tanabe  accused a housemate of having a “victim narrative.” At the end of the scene  one of the mortified hosts described the fight as ranking among the most explosive in the show’s history. (Spoiler alert: The housemates reconciled the next day when they agreed to spend more time trying to understand one another’s “point of view.”) “I usually get bored with shows ” Hachimura said. “But I can watch ‘Terrace House’ over and over.” Hachimura’s teammates are aware of his obsession  even if they do not share it. “We see him watching it on the plane all the time ” Wizards guard Troy Brown Jr. said. “But he doesn’t say much about it  probably because he knows we wouldn’t understand what he’s talking about.” That has not stopped Hachimura from introducing the show to friends  like Kenta Maeda  a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins. Hachimura had no idea how much Maeda had grown to love “Terrace House” until he settled in for a fresh episode last season — and saw Maeda on his TV screen as a guest commentator. Hachimura was floored  especially when Maeda told the show’s regular hosts that he had been a fan of the program “from the beginning.” “Yeah  I had to call him out on that ” Hachimura said. “And he was like  ‘OK  you got me.’ And I was like  ‘Yeah  I need to be real.’” Hachimura got his own opportunity to be on the show last July when he returned home to Japan following the draft. By then  he had seen his popularity in Japan soar to pop-star dimensions  with requests to appear on game shows  news programs  other reality shows — you name it. Hachimura turned them all down  except one: “Terrace House ” which asked his agents at Wasserman if he would fill in as a guest commentator for two episodes. Hachimura jumped at the chance. Yet for all his anticipation — “I was pretty nervous ” Hachimura said — he almost missed out. A few hours before the scheduled taping in Tokyo  he was in a different region of the country to watch one of his younger sisters play in a high school basketball tournament when a minor volcanic eruption forced the cancellation of his flight back to Tokyo. Hachimura scrambled back in time to take his spot on the studio set  then told the show’s hosts about the other offers he had declined. “Are you sure you’re making the most of your time?” the comedian Ryota Yamasato asked him. Hachimura went on to offer his observations about what was happening on the show  and even answered questions about his own love life. (He prefers “more mature” women.) But his appearance was about more than ticking an item off his bucket list  he said. He has spoken openly about his biracial background — his mother is Japanese  and his father is Beninese — and he viewed “Terrace House” as another opportunity to use his celebrity to help erase stigmas in Japan  where notions of racial purity persist. “It was a big deal for me ” he said. “And ‘Terrace House’ is a show where diversity has become really normal.” These days  even the show’s most trivial story lines — a drive to the shore  a tiff between housemates  a group outing to the new ramen restaurant — seem oddly reassuring. In an uncertain world  “Terrace House” now feels rooted to a bygone era as fans like Hachimura  and so many others  wait for their own lives to return to some sort of normalcy.

06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/ncaabasketball/sister-jean-ncaa-tournament-canceled.html, sports ncaabasketball, In a Time of Need  We Turn to Sister Jean, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt  the college basketball celebrity of 2018  has her own take on an N.C.A.A. tournament undone by calamity., Supported by Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt  the college basketball celebrity of 2018  has her own take on an N.C.A.A. tournament undone by calamity. By Jeff Arnold CHICAGO — The emails from Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt arrived as they always do after a game  one for each member of the Loyola-Chicago men’s basketball team. The Ramblers’ hopes for an N.C.A.A. tournament berth had been dashed by a 1-point loss to Valparaiso in overtime in the quarterfinals of last month’s Missouri Valley Conference tournament. Now Sister Jean  the team’s 100-year-old chaplain  had to help the players say goodbye to their season. She wrote that she knew that they had given their best effort  and she also gave them an assignment. Two years ago  during the N.C.A.A. tournament  Sister Jean became an international celebrity as Loyola made an exhilarating run to the Final Four. This year  she found a very different role as her team’s season ended without the possibility of a title. She asked the Loyola players to reflect on their childhood dreams  and to consider where their lives stood in relation to them. Less than a week after the Ramblers’ defeat  the coronavirus pandemic forced the N.C.A.A. to cancel its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments and the spring seasons of other sports. As the season ended without the possibility of a national championship for anyone  college athletes across the country faced questions very much like the ones Sister Jean had posed to the Ramblers. Where were their dreams now  as moments that they could have carried through their lives were snatched away in a heartbeat? “I think people will remember this year for the Final Four that never was ” Sister Jean said in a recent telephone interview. “I think people will remember this for a long time  and they’ll talk about it a lot.” She added: “This is a loss. It’s a big loss  and these kids that were supposed to be in the tournament  it’s not going to come back to them.” For weeks  Americans have grappled with life without sports  including the N.C.A.A men’s tournament  which would have culminated Monday with the championship game in Atlanta. Since the March 12 announcement that the tournament would not take place  coaches like Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski have been forced to adjust how they run their programs. Staff meetings now take place over Zoom  while interactions with players have shifted to FaceTime calls. The Sunday after the tournament was canceled  Krzyzewski held a final team meeting that included a version of “One Shining Moment ” the highlight montage regularly shown on TV after the men’s championship game. The Duke video was created by its athletic department as a substitute for a proper finale. Krzyzewski has found in the weeks since the cancellation that many athletes’ biggest concern is a lack of closure. “The reality really does not set in right away for them ” Krzyzewski  who has won five national championships at Duke  said in a recent telephone interview. He added: “It’s important for these youngsters  all of them — men and women  the basketball players — to have closure  and that closure does not end with showing them ‘One Shining Moment.’” Sister Jean often thinks back to 2018 and the string of dramatic victories that landed Loyola in a national semifinal against Michigan. Now she also considers how she and her beloved Ramblers would have felt if a global health crisis had erased the opportunity. Her personal collection of memorabilia from that tournament  including her Final Four ring  has become a part of a gallery at the Loyola University Museum of Art that is dedicated to her life’s work. For Sister Jean  a fan who has memories of watching the national tournament with fellow nuns in the 1940s  the cancellation meant an aching heart on behalf of the players and coaches who were set to experience the event  possibly for the first time. “Things had to be stopped ” she acknowledged  adding: “It was like the bottom of the bucket dropped out. It was like someone threw a bomb on us — there was not going to be anything.” The reality also abruptly hit home for Krzyzewski  who says there has been a noticeable void in American life since sports were put on hold to help slow the virus’s spread. “Not having sport — just not college basketball — but sport  you forget how inspirational it is for our country  and a diversion  too ” he said. “It’s inspiring  but it’s a diversion to things that happen to you in your life  your job. “You miss it. Inspiration across our country is needed ” Krzyzewski added. “I think what will come out of this is a greater appreciation for not just someone who hits a home run or dunks but for the normal great people in our country.” As the health crisis changes the way Americans live  Sister Jean  like many  is working from home. Her apartment sits almost eight miles from Loyola’s campus  where she still has an office in the university’s student center. Rather than maintaining the open-door policy that lets students seek her out  Sister Jean is now limited to communicating through emails  phone calls and video conferencing. Because the pandemic forced the campus to close  the end-of-season meetings Sister Jean scheduled with players became phone calls. The list of childhood dreams shared during those conversations ran the gamut. Some players looked forward to a life spent as a zookeeper or a medieval knight. Others imagined playing Division I basketball and reaching the N.B.A.  while others envisioned themselves  like Sister Jean  committing to a life serving God. Whether their dreams were realized or had changed  Sister Jean asked players to explore how their dreams had shaped them  leading up to such a life-altering period of time. After living through the Great Depression  the upheaval of World War II and the devastating terrorist attacks of Sept. 11  2001  Sister Jean now contemplates how the country will emerge from this crisis — which she says is unlike any she has experienced before. Sister Jean believes that over time  people will become kinder  more thoughtful and cautious. In a recent video  she encouraged people to stick together and to continue to work together. “Unless we do what we’re all supposed to do  we’re not going to survive ” she said  adding  “We’re going to win something out of this — we’ve already lost a lot  and people have suffered a lot  but I believe something good is going to come out of all of this.” In the meantime  Sister Jean will continue to begin her workday at 7:30 a.m.  when she tries to answer the emails she receives — sometimes 25 or 30 at a time. In her prayers  she says  she asks that the pandemic end. Sister Jean watches previous N.C.A.A. title games when she can find them  including Loyola’s 60-58 overtime victory over the two-time defending champion Cincinnati in 1963  and looks forward to the return of college basketball. But she also tries to find good in this season of life she admittedly sometimes struggles to understand. To do so  she says  requires some intentional thought. “When we go to bed  I think it’s good to think about all the good things that happened during the day ” Sister Jean said. “That way  we will go to sleep with less worry  and we will wake up joyful.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/sports/06ncaa-sisterjean1-print/merlin_135361308_07e4b1f4-8ecb-4f91-a70b-908f8c01752e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Jon Pareles The music of Bill Withers radiated a quality that’s rare in pop songs and  really  anywhere else: selflessness. It’s in the subjects that Withers  who died on Monday  chose to sing about: his grandmother’s hard-won wisdom in “Grandma’s Hands ” the suicidal regrets of a failed husband in “Better Off Dead ” and in one of his most indelible songs  “Lean on Me ” a churchy pledge of unconditional help and compassion. Perhaps it was because Withers was already a grown-up  in his early 30s  when his recording career started. He was raised in a large family in West Virginia coal country  served in the Navy and worked factory jobs before getting the chance to record. He hadn’t been sheltered from the everyday lives that he would write about. Withers’s most triumphant years  the early 1970s  were also an idealistic time for soul music. Marvin Gaye  Stevie Wonder  Curtis Mayfield  Earth  Wind & Fire and others were writing community-minded songs that melded urban realism and utopian aspiration. Withers could be every bit their peer  particularly in the ways he brought big issues down to personal stories  like his portrait of a badly wounded Vietnam veteran  “I Can’t Write Left-Handed.” And when he wasn’t observing outside characters  Withers could also depict the deepest jealousy  loneliness and melancholy  in songs like “Who Is He (And What Is He to You) ” “You ” and his despondent megahit  “Ain’t No Sunshine ” a model of profound simplicity. His voice was at the center of every song  reedy and gritty  strong enough for preacherly declamations and smooth enough to carry a lover’s endearments. Yet he chose to treat that utterly distinctive voice modestly — as a vehicle  not a centerpiece. He sang his stories with down-home fervor  but he was also more than willing to let the sense of the words dissolve into rhythm and incantation  into impulses and feelings. Withers made it seem — with deep-rooted knowledge and virtuoso skill — that each song was creating its own borderless style and groove on the spot  steeped in but never beholden to blues  gospel  country  jazz  folk  rock or any other defined idiom. Imagine Withers’s voice removed from songs like the defiant “Use Me ” and the grooves he devised (with his top-notch studio bands) nearly capture the mood on their own — though Withers’s vocals would also engage those grooves with every phrase. Withers was ill-used by a recording business that second-guessed his songwriting. In his acceptance speech at his long-belated 2015 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction  he defined A&R  record label jargon that stands for artists and repertoire  as “antagonistic and redundant.” After his 1974 album “+‘Justments ” filled with brooding songs about love gone wrong  Withers and his new label  Columbia  recast him as a more conventional romantic crooner. He had some suavely commercial moments: “Lovely Day” in 1977  which for its final minute flaunts one almost impossibly sustained note after another  and “Just the Two of Us ” which appeared on a 1980 album by the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. Withers’s musical ingenuity lingers on his later albums in some eccentric rhythm tracks and sly chord progressions — and he did manage to resist making disco. But the joyful  risky self-invention of his early albums had given way to professionalism. He made his last album in 1985  then earned a living from his publishing catalog  refusing offers to record again. The Withers album to savor is the one he recorded live at Carnegie Hall in 1972. He brought a band of first-call studio musicians and gathered all of his best early material  seasoned by serious touring. Songs that had been limited to three minutes in studio versions get a chance to groove longer and harder: “Use Me” rides a backbeat of audience handclaps to syncopated ecstasy  and tops that with a reprise. Withers’s voice had a rawer tone than his studio performances without sacrificing any improvisational subtleties. And the songs were populated not with one singer’s ego  but with friends  relatives  lovers  rivals and  in an all-out 13-minute  key-changing  wah-wah throwdown  a week in the life of an entire neighborhood  “Harlem.” It’s not about Withers; it’s about music where everybody lives.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/coronavirus-dilemmas-mourning.html, us, ‘We’re Going to See What Else the Word Funeral Can Mean’, As the coronavirus pandemic limits people’s ability to mourn  they are finding new ways to say goodbye., Supported by Dilemmas As the coronavirus pandemic limits people’s ability to mourn  they are finding new ways to say goodbye. By Jodi Kantor My father died of the coronavirus last week  and I’m not sure how to mourn. No visitors were allowed in the hospital  and my family did not get final goodbyes and I-love-yous  even over the phone. We think he died alone. My sister planned a service  but only a few people were there  and everyone had to remain six feet apart. I took the bus home  skipping the burial because I have no car and didn’t want to violate the six-feet rule. Afterward  we could not grieve together as a family or share a meal  stories  laughter and tears. In ordinary circumstances  I would have my retail job to go back to  which would help me regain a sense of normalcy. That option doesn’t exist now. How do I find closure? Maybe I can do a video conference  but it seems so impersonal and incomplete. THERESA SCHILIZZI  Brooklyn  N.Y. Dear Theresa  I couldn’t be sorrier about the loss of your father  or your quandary  which looms over us all. We may be about to confront death on a scale few of us have ever known  while being stripped of time-honored consolations: wakes  funerals  shivas. When the hour calls for togetherness  we will be apart. When I called you to learn more  you told me that two years ago  you took a course called “The Art of Dying ” about finding new ways to bring honor to the end of life. “It changed me  to view death in a sacred way ” you said. Instead  your father got an ending that defied everything you had learned about saying goodbye. To find answers  I turned to therapists and members of the clergy. Most of their advice was compassionate but resigned: Stay safe. Call friends. Even if a more extensive memorial is planned for later  don’t forgo the opportunity to mourn now. Give Zoom and Google Hangouts a try. “It’s the best that we can do under these circumstances ” said Rabbi Jesse Olitzky of Congregation Beth El in South Orange  N.J.  who has been leading funerals and shivas over Zoom. That did not seem like enough. Grasping for more  I contacted historians of death  seeking clues about how previous generations mourned amid pandemics. They offered some of the more hopeful answers  and a prediction: This crisis would transform the way we grieve. These kinds of catastrophes are what push us forward in our mourning rituals  and now we are poised to make another leap. “As gut-wrenching as these stories are going to be  we are going to find ways to innovate and adapt  to make meaning out of these separations ” said Gary Laderman  a professor of American religious history at Emory University. When disasters limit mourning  people invent new ways to say goodbye  Dr. Laderman and his peers said. It had happened many times before. The Black Death in Europe caused a high mortality rate among priests  so everyday people stepped in. During the Civil War  American families turned to embalming  to preserve the dead over time and distance  so they could be returned for burial at home. Those efforts helped give rise to the modern funeral industry. The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia left many of their victims in mass graves. So the bereaved switched to chanting over the possessions of the departed. Those shifts were poised to happen before the tragedies hit  the historians said. But the crises accelerated the changes  and they lasted because they filled some shared need. Based on what the historians said  Theresa  your “Art of Dying” class may be more relevant than ever. “In coming months  we’re going to see what else the word funeral can mean ” said Amy Cunningham  a funeral director in Brooklyn and a teacher of that course. Authority figures like funeral directors and clergy members may become less central to the grieving process. “I think we’ll see a radical shift in the democratization of authority  who has the right to officiate a funeral ” said Priya Parker  the host of a new podcast  called “Together Apart ” on how people can still connect during this crisis. Online funerals may dissolve the constraints of the form: size  location  cost. Eulogies could take on new shape. “We might imagine recorded remarks from loved ones  keeping their social distancing practices  filming words of remembrance at varied sites of significance to the deceased: a back porch rocking chair  a local fishing pond  a beloved hiking trail  the site of a first date ” wrote the Rev. Cody J. Sanders  an American Baptist chaplain at Harvard University. Mourners are likely to place less emphasis on the body of the deceased. “I fear that  in some instances  the only moment that the family will meet the body again is when those cremated remains arrive in the mail ” Ms. Cunningham said. Instead  the focus may be on memorializing that person’s life  and finding new ways to signal sorrow. In the 19th century  families had elaborate ways of telling the world they had lost a loved one  down to the texture of black fabric they wore  said Brandy Schillace  a medical historian. Windows were draped in black to mark a death in the home. “You could drive by a house  realize they were in grief and have solidarity with them ” she said. Many of those rituals were abandoned when medicine improved and fewer lives were lost  Dr. Schillace said. Now  as losses are beginning to mount  so is determination to forge new ways to comfort the bereaved. Volunteers are organizing donations of tablet computers to hospitals so that families in straits like yours will find it easier to share final moments. New grief groups are forming online. Prepare for more transformation in coming weeks  the historians predicted. Social media can turn a new practice into a tradition in 24 hours. Because no one is safe from the coronavirus  mortality is front and center for everyone. When this crisis is over  some of these changes are likely to endure. Even when it’s safe to travel again  many in-person funerals will start to include video conference options for those who are far away  Ms. Cunningham said. “I don’t know that the funeral will ever be the same ” she said. Theresa  you are in the vanguard  even if you never wanted to be. Because of the time you invested in your “Art of Dying” class  you may be better equipped than some. Is it any consolation to think of yourself as part of a historic shift  in a position to find your own solutions and then help others by sharing them? I hope so. With condolences  Jodi Kantor Dilemmas is a new column about dealing with the human quandaries presented by the coronavirus pandemic. Please send yours to dilemmas@nytimes.com. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.

Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/coronavirus-scams-fraud-price-gouging.html, us politics, Another Thing to Fear Out There: Coronavirus Scammers, The authorities say there has been a surge in fraud and cons seeking to capitalize on fears of the virus., Supported by The authorities say there has been a surge in fraud and cons seeking to capitalize on fears of the virus. By Sharon LaFraniere and Chris Hamby The white banner with images of red crosses had been hastily erected in front of two pop-up tents at a convenience store parking lot in central Louisville  Ky. “Covid-19 testing here ” it read. A clutch of workers in white hazmat suits swabbed the mouths of drivers  who had each forked over $240 to learn whether they had been infected with the coronavirus. “I have managed hospitals for years ” a man in charge told journalists and skeptical community activists at the scene on Wednesday. “We are doing things the right way.” But nothing about the venture was right  from the workers’ failure to change gloves between customers to a bogus claim on a sign that the operation was approved by “HIPPA ” a misspelled acronym for the federal law that restricts how health data can be shared. Instead  said David James  the president of the Louisville Metro Council  it was a flagrant attempt to con panicked citizens into handing over their money  along with social security numbers and credit card information that could be used for identity theft. “It was ridiculous ” Mr. James said. He estimated that more than 100 people were deceived before the leaders of the apparently fake testers threw their supplies into the back of a truck and fled north up the highway. Federal  state and local law enforcement authorities are reporting an explosion of such scams as fraudsters move to capitalize on public panic over the fast-moving pandemic and the flood of federal money making its way to most Americans to help address the economic fallout. “We are seeing fraud across the board  everything from low-tech to very sophisticated schemes ” said G. Zachary Terwilliger  the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The pandemic has affected so many people in so many different ways  he said  that “it just allows the fraudsters to have their buffet  as it were  to prey upon vulnerable people.” Seeking to stay ahead of the curve  the Justice Department has set up a task force to investigate price-gouging and prosecutors have been instructed to prioritize fraud cases. With more than $2 trillion in federal assistance pouring into the economy  the authorities are girding for both lone wolf operations and more complicated schemes akin to those that arose during the 2008 federal program to bail out financial institutions. Other agencies have followed suit. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to more than 15 companies peddling unproven treatments or diagnostic tests. State attorneys general are fighting the same practices by issuing cease-and-desist orders. The Environmental Protection Agency has threatened legal action against retailers that sell unregistered disinfectants and sanitizers that falsely claim to protect against the virus. And the Federal Trade Commission reported Tuesday that the number of coronavirus-related complaints it had received from consumers this year had doubled during the previous week  reaching more than 7 800. “Scams follow the headlines  and that’s certainly the case with this ” said Monica Vaca  a consumer protection lawyer for the agency. Last month  Dr. Alexander G. Salerno  an internist in East Orange  N.J.  was desperately searching for personal protective equipment for his fellow medical workers. “It is like trying to find spare change in your couch ” he said. His regular suppliers were out  but through similarly hard-pressed medical providers commiserating in a WhatsApp group chat  he was able to contact several sellers. A man who never revealed his name to Dr. Salerno — and who the authorities later said was operating out of an auto body shop — agreed to sell him 3 000 surgical masks and 2 800 sterile gowns for $12 000  a markup of about 700 percent. Dr. Salerno wired the money to a bank account. When he went to pick up some of the supplies on March 18  he said  the man led him to a warehouse packed with enough medical equipment to outfit an entire hospital. Inside  he saw pallet upon pallet of N95 protective masks  surgical gowns  Clorox wipes and hand sanitizers. “He had everything  right from the factory  certified real stuff ” Dr. Salerno said. The doctor said he tried and failed to alert the state attorney general’s office. But the morning after a local television station aired a story about his experience  F.B.I. agents appeared at his office. “We jumped all over it ” said Craig Carpenito  the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey who leads the task force from Newark. “It’s outrageous. If I was married to  or if I was a health care professional  I would be horrified right now that I can’t get the simple equipment I need for protection.” The seller  Baruch Feldheim of Brooklyn  ran a company called “Solo Supplies” that had compiled a vast stockpile on the open market  including from a source in Canada  of 192 000 N95 masks  598 000 pairs of surgical gloves and 130 000 other items like surgical masks  the authorities said. Mr. Feldheim was arrested on Monday and charged with false statements and — because agents said he deliberately coughed in their direction and said he was sick with the virus — assaulting a federal officer. Asked why he was not charged with the crime of hoarding essential materials  authorities said that the investigation was continuing. Using its authority under the Defense Production Act  the federal government bought Mr. Feldheim’s entire inventory — at standard prices — and shipped it to hard-pressed medical workers in New York and New Jersey. “It’s just about the most un-American thing that I have encountered in my life ” Mr. Carpenito said. “People are out there looking to profit  despicably  from the greatest national crisis we have seen since World War II.” The Newark case is one of a handful that federal prosecutors have brought over the past few weeks. In Austin  Texas  the F.B.I. shut down a website that promised consumers access to World Health Organization “vaccine kits” in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95  payable by credit card. No vaccine for the virus exists. In Georgia  F.B.I. agents arrested a 49-year-old man on charges of collecting kickbacks for Covid-19 tests and screenings for other respiratory illnesses in a scheme that aimed to submit $1.1 million in fraudulent Medicare claims. According to court documents  the man was upfront about his motives. “Everybody has been chasing the Covid dollar bird ” he said in a telephone conversation  according to court papers. “While there are people going through what they are going through  you can either go bankrupt or you can prosper.” That was apparently the view of another operator who promised a California union of nearly 100 000 health care workers that he could provide them 39 million N95 masks. But when health care providers like Kaiser Permanente sought to verify and inspect the man’s supply chain  he proved more and more elusive. Last week  a federal prosecutor contacted the union  the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West  for details about the seller. “As far as we know  no money changed hands ” said Steve Trossman  a spokesman for the union  which was trying to serve as an intermediary to hospitals. “The really bad thing was  the masks were desperately needed.” In Southern California  agents arrested a 53-year-old  small-time actor for seeking investments in a nonexistent company that he claimed was just days away from marketing pills that would ward off the virus and injections that would cure Covid-19. The authorities said his YouTube and Instagram videos  in which he displayed a syringe of clear liquid or nondescript white pills  had been viewed more than two million times. A self-described genius entrepreneur  the man claimed in a text to a cooperating witness that a Los Angeles patient stricken by Covid-19 rose from a sickbed and “walked out 51 hours after my injection ” the authorities said. He claimed he knew a doctor with White House ties who was on his way to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for an emergency order authorizing his drugs and promised a $300 000 investment in his company would yield a $30 million return. Law enforcement officials are warning consumers to be especially wary of cyberscams  including sophisticated emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the Red Cross or other health organizations. One study suggested 3 percent of coronavirus-related domain names registered since January were malicious  while another 5 percent were suspicious. State attorneys general  like Letitia James of New York  have been warning companies that register domain names to be more vigilant. Such frauds are only expected to multiply as the federal government doles out financial aid to individuals and businesses as part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package. Twelve years later  federal investigators are still pursuing bad actors who misused the $475 billion federal program intended to bail out banks and financial institutions after the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. More than 400 people have been prosecuted  including 76 bankers who went to prison. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

Some Fear Other Motives., Prime Minister Viktor Orban can now rule by decree. Doctors worry he won’t use that power to improve the country’s coronavirus response., Supported by Prime Minister Viktor Orban can now rule by decree. Doctors worry he won’t use that power to improve the country’s coronavirus response. By Benjamin Novak and Patrick Kingsley BUDAPEST — In the days since the Hungarian Parliament gave Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule indefinitely by decree  nominally in the name of combating the coronavirus pandemic  his government has been energized by much other than the disease. First  his deputy briefly toyed with a plan to strip powers from city mayors  many of whom represent opposition parties. Then he threw a cloak of secrecy over one of Hungary’s most expensive infrastructure projects  announcing a bill that would classify key information about a Chinese-funded railway for a decade. Next  he slashed bureaucratic obstacles to expedite a contentious construction project opposed by the opposition. Finally  he announced plans to scrap state recognition of gender transition. By comparison  Mr. Orban took a gentler approach to testing for the coronavirus. By Saturday  Hungarian officials had detected fewer than 700 cases  one of the lowest tallies in the European Union. The chief medical officer  Cecilia Muller  also said that the disease was still spreading only within clusters of people  rather than through the general population at large. On Sunday  reported cases grew to 733. But some doctors fear that the numbers are so low only because the government has tested so few people. By Saturday  officials had conducted fewer than 20 000 tests — also one of the lowest totals  as a proportion of the national population  in the European Union. “We do not have enough tests  so we do not know the realistic data ” said Balazs Rekassy  a former manager of a state health clinic who advises the Budapest mayor  an opponent of Mr. Orban  on medical matters. “Mr. Orban is very smart — he’s taking this special situation to his advantage ” said Dr. Rekassy. “He’s trying to strengthen his power and create long-term political advantages.” New restrictions on journalism that the government deems fake and harmful to the coronavirus response have made it harder to research the scale of the pandemic in Hungary. Many doctors are now reluctant to speak out publicly about specific problems  individual hospitals have been barred from releasing information and journalists are warier of publishing it. But beneath the veil of silence  there are indications that the situation may be graver than records show. The coronavirus may have begun to spread through the Hungarian population nearly a month ago  in a process technically known as community transmission  according to a secret readout written by a foreign diplomat who had been briefed in early March by the country director for the World Health Organization  Dr. Ledia Lazeri. The readout was later obtained by The New York Times. Dr. Muller  the chief medical officer  said on Friday that Hungary was still in the cluster-spreading phase. She hinted that the country was on the threshold of community transmission. But according to the diplomat’s secret readout  the W.H.O. privately believed that community transmission had begun by the second week of March  since the disease’s first known victims in Hungary moved freely through the country before being diagnosed and one even left for Serbia. The main facility used for testing at that time  St. Laszlo Hospital in Budapest  was also helping to spread the disease rather than contain it  because infected people were unwittingly mingling there with those yet to catch the disease  the readout stated. The W.H.O. also concluded that the Hungarian government’s data was unreliable  since so few people were being tested  the readout said. Asked to comment on the readout  Dr. Lazeri denied making these assessments. An independent epidemiologist currently advising the government  Gergely Roth  also said the country had not yet entered the community transmission phase  and said the term had a contested definition. But diplomats from other missions said they had heard troubling information from a W.H.O. official. The W.H.O. did not comment when asked three times whether the organization believed Hungary had entered the community transmission phase. But a spokesperson said on Saturday night that the W.H.O. was “working with countries to define their transmission status according to a new ranking system ” and noted that as of Saturday night the Hungarian government considered the country to be “entering community transmission.” As of Sunday  only 34 people are reported to have died from the virus in Hungary  but doctors worry that some deaths may have been attributed to other causes. A 99-year-old woman who died on March 11 in Budapest was reported to have died of pneumonia  even though her daughter  who visited her regularly and fell ill with similar symptoms at the same time  later tested positive for the virus. The government has also quietly closed parts of the St. Imre Hospital in Budapest  after the disease spread among staff  two senior state doctors said on condition of anonymity. The hospital declined to comment  referring reporters to a government spokesman  who did not reply to two requests. Some critics said the government had been slow to use the test facilities it already had at its disposal. Officials did not start testing at laboratories at the Semmelweis Medical School  which alone has the capacity to process at least 400 tests per day  until mid-March. Like many other countries  “Hungary did not respond in time ” said Andras Falus  a professor emeritus at the school. But other doctors praised the government as doing a good job in tough circumstances  at a time of profound economic upheaval in which no country has tested enough people  let alone perfected its response to the pandemic. “I do not see right now  for the time being  that there is a big turd in the crepe ” said Gabor Zacher  an emergency doctor with the Hungarian ambulance service. Dr. Zacher has criticized the government’s health measures in the past  but praised its recent social distancing measures. Hungary implemented social distancing measures earlier than several other European countries  said Gergely Rost  an epidemiologist whom the government recently enlisted to advise Mr. Orban on the likely spread of the virus. “As a consequence  we still don’t have too many ” said Dr. Rost  a lecturer at the University of Szeged  a college in southeastern Hungary. “At the moment  the epidemic is pretty much suppressed.” Because of a lack of tests  the real number of cases is likely to be up to nine times higher than the current tally of infections  Dr. Rost said. But “numbers are underestimated in every country  even those who have tested more.” For some  the problems with Mr. Orban’s response to the pandemic stem less from his actions since the start of the crisis  and more from his systemic neglect of Hungarian health care since re-entering office in 2010. Under Mr. Orban  his government’s health care budget dropped as a proportion of national economic output  even as state spending rose in other sectors. He also abolished the Health Ministry  assigning its responsibilities to a larger department. Around 10 percent of Hungarian doctors left the country in the first seven years of Mr. Orban’s current tenure in search of better-paid work  senior doctors estimated. The salary of a Hungarian general practitioner  as a proportion of the average national wage  is one of the lowest in Europe. Under Mr. Orban  the cancer death rate rose and is tied for the worst in the European Union. Even before the coronavirus outbreak  the government refused to disclose the number of infections contracted in state hospitals for fear of alarming the public. In the context of the coronavirus  his government’s most unhelpful action was the dismantling in 2017 of a state-run health authority that included a dedicated team of epidemiologists. Following the authority’s closing  these experts on pandemics either left government or were dispersed to other parts of the health system  undermining the government’s ability to react to a disease like the coronavirus. “The extremely well-functioning pandemic defense network was weakened in recent years ” says Erzsebet Pusztai  a health care expert. “The previous unified organization was taken apart and distributed under government offices  and many experts left. And this serious pandemic found it in a very weakened condition.” Years of low funding have left health facilities under-resourced  and contributed to a recent row about whether the government or health care workers should pay for their masks and visors. “Health care workers are going unarmed into battle — we hardly have any protective masks ” said Dr. Peter Lehoczky  the director of outpatient care in a district of Budapest. “The feeling is that we are trying to shoot down a rocket with a slingshot.” Benjamin Novak reported from Budapest  and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

The lawyer  Wang Quanzhang  was the last of hundreds of legal workers to face prosecution after a widespread crackdown by China on the field in 2015. He was not tried until December 2018  more than three years after his detention. During his trial  which was held in secret  he was sentenced to four and half years in prison for “subversion of state power ” a charge used to target people the authorities believe are attempting to organize challenges to the ruling Communist Party. Mr. Wang’s wife  Li Wenzu  wrote on Twitter that she received a call from him on Sunday morning saying he had been released from prison but she had said in recent days that she feared they would not be able to reunite. Mr. Wang  44  and his family have long lived in Beijing  the capital  but he was ordered to remain in Shandong Province  where he had been imprisoned and which is the site of his household registration  Ms. Li said. Ms. Li could not be immediately contacted. But in a video posted online she said that as a native of Hubei  where the coronavirus pandemic began late last year  she would not be allowed back into Beijing if she left because of quarantine rules. “We have been waiting for nearly five years  seeing this day approach ” she said in a video posted Tuesday. “But I can’t see him at that first moment  can’t bring him back home from prison. The more I think about this I become fidgety.” Legal rights organizations have warned that while Mr. Wang has been released from prison  he could remain far from truly free and possibly under some form of house arrest or strict surveillance. The China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group  a Hong Kong-based advocacy organization  said that similar restrictions had been placed on other released legal workers. Jiang Tianyong  who helped publicize the torture claims of another lawyer and was imprisoned for two years for inciting subversion  remains under house arrest in Henan Province after his release last year. He has been deprived access to medical care  the group said. The organization released a letter signed by a dozen legal and human rights groups calling on the Chinese government to not put Mr. Wang “under any form of house arrest  surveillance  or any other form of control over his personal freedom.” Ms. Li has helped draw attention to her husband’s case  even as the government has tried to hide it from public view. His trial was held behind closed doors because the court in Tianjin  where he was tried  determined the case involved state secrets. In 2018 Ms. Li and family members of other detained lawyers tried to march about 60 miles from Beijing to Tianjin  where her husband was then being held. She and the wives of other legal activists shaved their heads to protest the treatment of their husbands. In Mandarin the word for “hair” sounds like “law.” “In Chinese  having no hair sounds like having no law ” Ms. Li said in 2018. “We meant that we can do without our hair  but we can’t do without law.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/world/05china-lawyer/merlin_149925906_682ee3ce-5228-46b0-b33e-d7ca6e936b91-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-austin-ramzy/author-austin-ramzy-thumbLarge.png 
05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/germany-oberammergau-passion-play-coronavirus.html, world europe, Of Beards and Bubonic Plague: German Village Prays for a (2nd) Miracle, , In 1633 the Bavarian village of Oberammergau  ravaged by a pandemic  made a pledge to God. Now another pandemic has forced villagers to abandon their promise. The village of Oberammergau in Bavaria  Germany.Credit... Supported by By Katrin Bennhold Photographs by Laetitia Vancon OBERAMMERGAU  Germany — There is no doubt in the mind of the Rev. Thomas Gröner that what happened in his village was a miracle. He says he has proof  too. The pandemic had ravaged the village. One in four people are believed to have died. “Whole families  gone ” Father Gröner said. Then villagers stood before a cross and pledged to God that if he spared those who remained  they would perform the Passion Play — enacting Jesus’ life  death and resurrection — every 10th year forever after. It was 1633. The bubonic plague was still raging in Bavaria. But legend has it that after the pledge  no one else in the village died from it. Standing in his church underneath the cross where villagers had once made their promise  Father Gröner held out a battered leather-bound book. “Look ” he said  his fingers scanning a faded page with tightly packed handwriting that abruptly stops three quarters down. “They recorded dozens and dozens of deaths and then — none.” For nearly four centuries  the people of Oberammergau (pronounced oh-ber-AH-mer-gow) more or less kept their promise  celebrating their salvation from one pandemic — until another pandemic forced them to break it. This year’s Passion Play  scheduled to premiere in May and run through the summer  had to be abandoned because of the coronavirus. An epic production  cast with local residents as actors  the play would have brought half a million visitors to the village and 2 500 people  or half of Oberammergau  onto the world’s biggest open-air stage. The production would have been the 42nd since the play’s premiere in 1634. Canceled only twice — in 1770 during the enlightenment and in 1940 during World War II — the play has been performed once every decade and sometimes twice  for special anniversaries. It had to be postponed once before — after too many men had died in World War I to field a cast. Now  as Easter weekend approaches  Oberammergau is praying for another miracle. So far  the village does not have a single known case of Covid-19. Bad Kohlgrub 150 miles Berlin 2 Germany 23 95 Frankfurt Oberammergau France Oberammergau switz. germany austria Street data from OpenStreetMap 5 miles By The New York Times “Maybe the pledge still protects the village?” Susanne Eski  a dressmaker asked hopefully  as she was preparing to put costumes for the Passion Play into storage one recent afternoon. But outside Oberammergau the number of cases have been rising  and most fear it is just a matter of time. On Palm Sunday  there were more than 91 000 infections in Germany and more than 1 300 deaths. For centuries  kings and queens  leaders and celebrities  have flocked to this small village in the Bavarian Alps to be immersed in the story of salvation. Since the mid-1960s  the play has been criticized for its crude anti-Semitism  first by Jewish groups and later by the Roman Catholic Church itself. Hitler reportedly loved it and deemed it “important to the Reich.” Christian Stückl has directed the Passion Play for three decades  gradually ridding it of its most egregious anti-Semitic symbolism and opening the cast to Protestants  Muslims and married women. He welled up with emotion when he announced that this year’s performances would be postponed by two years. The village had been building up to this moment for a decade. For months  hotels and restaurants had staffed up to cope with the onslaught of visitors. Local craftsmen worked overtime to sculpt the stage props. Volunteers helped sew costumes. Rehearsals brought together all age groups in the village from toddlers to grandparents  sometimes daily. And  in keeping with an ancient village statute  many men had stopped shaving a year ago to allow hair to sprout freely  A.D.-30 style. But the rehearsals have stopped. The Passion Play theater  with its 4 500 seats  stands empty. Props and costumes are going into storage. Only the beards remain: Both village hairdressers are shut because of the coronavirus. “If you didn’t know this was Oberammergau  you’d think this village is full of hipsters or jihadis ” joked Cengiz Görür  20  a son of a local restaurant owner and the first Muslim to get a leading part in the Passion Play. He was cast as Judas  the play’s traditional villain  which  as the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung recently wrote  “some outside observers find very modern  others a little nasty.” The director said he got the role for his great acting talent. It has been more than two weeks since the postponement was announced  and a collective sense of gloom has given way to an anxious calm. Like elsewhere in Germany  Oberammergau is adapting to the new reality of life under a pandemic — but perhaps more than elsewhere  villagers are looking at their fate through the prism of their local history. The story of the plague profoundly shaped this village  remarked Eva Reiser  who was to play Mary. “How will the coronavirus change us and our world?” she wondered. “What will be the stories they tell about us?” Already  the coronavirus has given new significance to the words Frederik Mayet  who was to play Jesus  had been rehearsing. When Jesus addresses the people of Jerusalem  he talks about how “poverty and disease are carrying you off.” In two years time  when the pandemic has taken its toll and the Passion Play is resurrected  Mr. Mayet said  “that sentence will have a whole different meaning.” Mr. Stückl  the director  can trace his own family back to the days of the plague. Its first victim was one of his ancestors  the caretaker of the church. Wild-haired and chain-smoking  Mr. Stückl is a lifelong Catholic but he is not so sure that what happened in 1633 was a miracle. The pledge was made in October  he pointed out  just as winter set in. The plague bacterium does not do well in the cold. “There is probably a scientific explanation ” he said. In times like these  humans need stories of hope and redemption  he acknowledged  but they also need to trust in science. These days  under government orders  the streets of Oberammergau have emptied and the two village schools closed. The bakery and butcher are still open  but handwritten signs urge customers to enter only two at a time. All religious services are canceled  too. The economic fallout has been immediate and brutal  said Anton Preisinger  who was going to play Pilate  the Roman governor who orders Jesus’ crucifixion. His hotel  owned by his family since the 19th century  went from being fully booked to “zero bookings.” He’s already had to let 13 people go. “Social distancing hurts when social contact is your livelihood ” he said. But during a pandemic  social distancing is vital. And Oberammergau knows this first hand. “We’ve done it before ” Mr. Mayet said. In 1632 it looked as if the village might escape the plague. All surrounding villages had been devastated. In nearby Bad Kohlgrub only one married couple was said to have survived. But Oberammergau had been spared. It had  in modern parlance  gone into quarantine — a sort of self-imposed isolation meant to keep villagers in and visitors out. Guards patrolled village boundaries. They erected plague fires as a deterrence. “It was social distancing  17th-century style ” Mr. Mayet said. “The village went into lockdown. It closed its borders.” And for a while it worked. But one night  a villager who was working in a neighboring village was so desperate to see his family that he slipped past the guards. His name was Kaspar Schisler and he brought the plague with him. Everybody in the village knows his name. There is even a street named after him. “No one wants to be Kaspar Schisler ” Ms. Reiser said. “No one wants to be the person who brings the virus into the village.” Ms. Reiser  who works as a flight attendant when she is not playing the mother of God  has been aware of the coronavirus for longer than most in Oberammergau. In late January  a Chinese passenger on a flight from Munich to Lyon was suspected to have contracted the virus. It turned out to be a false alarm. But after that  Ms. Reiser started counting the days through the 14-day incubation period every time she found herself in a crowded place  obsessively washing her hands and keeping her distance from her grandmother  92. “She wants to live through one more Passion Play ” Ms. Reiser said. In Oberammergau a lifetime is often measured in Passion Plays. This would have been her grandmother’s 10th. An hour’s drive from Oberammergau  deep in the woods  there is a chapel dedicated to a little known saint who is only now being rediscovered — Saint Corona  patron saint of resisting epidemics  Father Gröner said. There are hard times ahead  he said. But everything has two sides. Perhaps something good will come of this crisis  he said. The return of solidarity and compassion for each other and the planet. “In a way ” Father Gröner said  “the story of suffering and salvation they have been rehearsing onstage is now playing out in real life.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

Its wooden hull  which is about 50 feet long  appeared in 1958 after a storm  and again in 1978  2007 and 2013  capturing the interest of local residents and visitors to Short Sands Beach. The last time waves exposed its frame was in March 2018. The Maine Historic Preservation Commission has said it believes the wreckage dates from the period between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. But the history and identity of the ship remained uncertain in York  a small resort town 45 miles south of Portland. Relying on historical records  archaeological work and wood samples from the ship  Stefan Claesson  the maritime researcher  told York town officials last month that he believed the remains most likely were from the Defiance  a sloop that was built in Massachusetts in 1754. Sloops were single-mast vessels used for transporting cargo. “This is one of a very few examples of a pre-Revolutionary War or Colonial-built ship from New England ” said Mr. Claesson  the owner of the aerial drone and archaeological surveying company in New Hampshire. “There is still a lot to learn about how exactly these ships were designed and built — ships that were the lifeline for early settlements  and were the main vehicles of trade and commerce in New England and the U.S.” Mr. Claesson  who grew up in Maine and spent his summers and early years in York  said he first became interested in the wreckage after a storm in 2007. “Like most everyone  I was completely unaware of the wreck under the beach until it was revealed by that Patriots’ Day storm in 2007 ” he said. The wreckage typically lies between 4 and 6 feet below the sand. About a month after it is exposed  it gets covered up naturally  but the town also trucks in sand to help the beach recover  he said. In 2018  after waves revealed the wreckage again  Mr. Claesson took wood samples from the hull plank and ship frame. The samples were tested at the Cornell University Tree-Ring Laboratory in Ithaca  N.Y.  to determine their age. The analysis suggested that the trees that were felled had a ring date of about 1753. “Of interest in this particular study was that three different species were used  two that are not commonly used in shipbuilding  that grow right here in New England and northeastern North America ” Carol B. Griggs  a senior research associate at the Tree-Ring Laboratory  said on Sunday. Whether the ship is the Defiance or another vessel  it was built in 1753 or soon after  and most likely somewhere along the New England coast  she said. After combing through historical and notary records  including a firsthand account he found at the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum in Rowley  Mass.  Mr. Claesson learned that there was a sloop called the Defiance that had been wrecked in York in 1769. He also found that a sloop with the same name “was coincidentally built in 1754 in Massachusetts  which fits well with our tree-ring dates of circa 1753 ” he said. Mr. Claesson said his research found that the Defiance was traveling from Salem and headed for Portland when it encountered a storm. “They took anchor  but in heavy seas the crew was forced to cut the anchor cables  and were pushed ashore onto York Beach ” Mr. Claesson said. “The ship was a total loss  but the crew survived.” Over the years  storm waves have occasionally uncovered the shipwreck. The weathered ruins have intrigued residents and visitors who come to marvel at the site and take photos. “It is a local oddity ” said Elizabeth D. Blanchard  a member of the York Board of Selectmen. She has seen the wreckage about three times. “It doesn’t appear very often ” she said. “It’s kind of neat.” In 2018  York’s Police Department posted photos of the wreckage on Facebook  drawing more than 2 000 shares and national headlines. Because of the attention at the time  town officials temporarily placed police tape around the ruins after reports that people were taking pieces of it  The Portland Press Herald reported. Mr. Claesson said he has presented his research to the York board and the Ellis Park Committee  which manages the beach. He said he hoped town officials could protect the wreckage. “Minimally  I hope there will be a local stewardship team assembled to keep an eye on the site during storm season  protect the site from looters  and inform visitors how to interact responsibly with the site when it is exposed ” he said. But Mr. Claesson added that there must be more archaeological research to confirm that the wreck is indeed the Defiance. “It would be great to have a chance to conduct a more detailed archaeological investigation to understand how the ship was designed and built  and confirm the identification as Defiance ” he said. “We may not have too many more opportunities to document marine architecture of this vintage  and tell the story of these early American seafarers.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/science/05xp-shipwreck/merlin_171264309_cf9fdc5c-e1c0-4140-8bd6-620fa5fc8a2c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/reader-center/author-johnny-diaz/author-johnny-diaz-thumbLarge.png 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/terrorist-label-white-supremacy-Russian-Imperial-Movement.html, us politics, U.S. Will Give Terrorist Label to White Supremacist Group for First Time, The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement reflects growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links., Supported by The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement reflects growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links. By Charlie Savage  Adam Goldman and Eric Schmitt WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expected to announce on Monday that it is designating an ultranationalist group based in Russia as a terrorist organization  according to officials. It is the first time the government will apply the label to a white supremacist group. While the label of specially designated global terrorist has been frequently used for Islamist extremists  there have been growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links over the past five years. In 2018  the White House added that threat to the government’s National Strategy for Counterterrorism. “These designations are unprecedented ” said Ambassador Nathan A. Sales  the State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator. “This is the first time the United States has ever designated white supremacists as terrorists  and this illustrates how seriously this administration takes the white supremacist terrorist threat. We are doing things no previous administration has done to counter this threat.” The State Department’s designation for the organization  the Russian Imperial Movement  sets up the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to block any American property or assets belonging to the group. It will also bar Americans from financial dealings with the organization and make it easier to ban its members from traveling to the United States. The United States is also designating three of the group’s leaders — Stanislav Anatolyevich Vorobyev  Denis Valliullovich Gariev and Nikolay Nikolayevich Trushchalov — as individual terrorists who will face similar sanctions  the officials said. The authority for either the Treasury Department or the State Department to deem a group or an individual a specially designated global terrorist traces back to an executive order issued by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11  2001  terrorist attacks. President Trump in September signed an executive order expanding that authority to cover groups that provide training for terrorists even if the groups are not directly linked to any attack. The system parallels in some ways but is different from when the government designates a group as a foreign terrorist organization  which has separate criteria and applies only to groups rather than individuals. The move could cut against criticism that the Trump administration has played down the threat of white nationalist violence for political reasons  based on the so-called alt-right’s support for Mr. Trump and his statement in 2017 that there were “very fine people on both sides” of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Va. The Russian Imperial Movement is not considered to be sponsored by the Russian government  officials said  although President Vladimir V. Putin has tolerated its activities and it has helped advance the Russian government’s external goals by recruiting Russian fighters to aid pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. The group has also helped support neo-Nazi organizations in Scandinavia  which dovetails with the Russian government’s broader pattern of trying to stoke internal divisions  including along racial lines  and sow chaos in Western democracies. In 2017  the Russian Imperial Movement came up at a trial in Sweden of three men who were accused of plotting bomb attacks targeting asylum seekers. Prosecutors said two of the defendants had traveled to St. Petersburg  Russia  to attend 11 days of paramilitary training at a camp operated by the group  fueling their radicalization. Mr. Sales said the group operated two facilities in St. Petersburg that offered paramilitary training to neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He said the United States had assessed that the camps were “likely being used for woodland and urban assault  tactical weapons and hand-to-hand combat training.” Mary McCord  a former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division  said that until now  the counterterrorism sanctions system had overwhelmingly been used against Islamist extremist groups. She called its expansion to a white supremacist group significant. “It is important ” she said. “Far-right extremist causes  in particular white supremacy and white nationalism  have become more international. It is appropriate for the State Department to have been scrutinizing whether there are organizations that meet the criteria for that designation because with it  the organization becomes poison in terms of doing business with it or providing funds  goods or services to it.” The move is also another example of the Trump administration expanding its use of the power Congress granted to the executive branch to impose sanctions on groups by designating them foreign terrorist organizations. Last year  under a separate authority  the United States designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps  an arm of the Iranian military  as a foreign terrorist group — the first time it gave that label to a nation-state entity. Concerns have been escalating for several years that there is a growing transnational white supremacist or alt-right movement  as illustrated by the 2019 mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand  by an Australian man who streamed the killings of 51 people on Facebook Live. Against that backdrop  national security officials are said to have been searching for a neo-Nazi-style group that the U.S. government could designate as a foreign terrorist organization. One challenge to finding an appropriate candidate was that designating a group with significant American ties would also raise major First Amendment issues  officials said. Although a Russian Imperial Movement member has visited the United States  the organization does not appear to have domestic members. It is not clear if the group has provided training to U.S.-based neo-Nazis. Fighting domestic terrorism  including violent white nationalists  has become a priority for the F.B.I. Federal and local authorities have made a wave of arrests in recent months  targeting members of two neo-Nazi groups called Atomwaffen Division and The Base. The F.B.I. has been investigating whether the leader of The Base  who lives in St. Petersburg  has any ties to the Russian government’s security or intelligence services  former law enforcement officials said. Mr. Sales said they were continuing to look for other white supremacist groups or individuals who met the criteria for sanctions  but declined to comment on any specifics. The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement would make it easier for the F.B.I. to open sanctions-evasion investigations into Americans who appear to have ties to the group  just as it can with Islamist groups like Al Qaeda  the Islamic State or Hezbollah. The Trump administration is preparing to unveil the move under the banner of combating “racially or ethnically motivated terrorism.” The F.B.I. refers to such groups as racially motivated violent extremists  which have committed the “most lethal incidents among domestic terrorists in recent years ” the F.B.I. said last year in congressional testimony.

02/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/theater/gerald-freedman-dead.html, theater, Gerald Freedman  Prolific Stage Director  Dies at 92, Among his credits were musicals  operas and the original production of “Hair.” He influenced numerous actors’ careers as an educator., Supported by Among his credits were musicals  operas and the original production of “Hair.” He influenced numerous actors’ careers as an educator. By Neil Genzlinger Gerald Freedman  who directed countless plays  operas and musicals  including the original “Hair” in 1967 and more than a dozen Broadway productions  died on March 17 at his home in Winston-Salem  N.C. He was 92. The cause was kidney failure  said Robert Beseda  who had been his caregiver for the past nine years. Mr. Freedman had been dean of the drama school at the University of North Carolina School of Arts for 21 years  and Mr. Beseda was the assistant dean. Mr. Freedman was a pivotal though somewhat under-the-radar figure in New York theater for decades. He was a trusted assistant to Jerome Robbins when Mr. Robbins was directing the Broadway hits “Bells Are Ringing ” “West Side Story ” and “Gypsy” in the 1950s. He worked for years as artistic director of Joseph Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival and inaugurated the performance space now known as the Public Theater with “Hair.” In the 1970s  he directed productions by the Acting Company  the troupe founded in 1972 by John Houseman and Margot Harley  and from 1966 to 1989 he directed New York City Opera productions. Mr. Freedman had dozens of regional opera and theater credits  including 28 at the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland  where he was artistic director from 1985 to 1997. And as both a director and a teacher  he imparted an abiding appreciation of how to approach a text. “His approach was unique ” said Debbie Allen  who played Anita in an acclaimed Broadway revival of “West Side Story” in 1980 that was jointly directed by Mr. Robbins and Mr. Freedman. Mr. Freedman  she said  “didn’t even think about blocking or staging until we sat at a table for at least two weeks  breaking down the dramatic narrative  the character  the need and the action.” Gerald Alan Freedman was born on June 25  1927  in Lorain  Ohio. His father  Barnie  was a dentist  and his mother  Fannie (Sepsenwol) Freedman  was a teacher. Both were Jewish immigrants from czarist Russia. They steeped their home in art and music. After graduating from Lorain High School  Mr. Freedman attended Northwestern University  earning a bachelor’s degree there in 1949 and a master’s degree the next year. In 1951 he took a train to New York with vague ideas about becoming a painter  a singer or an actor. An acquaintance told him that as a high tenor he could earn money by singing at religious services. “On Friday nights I could do two Jewish services at different temples ” he said in an interview for “The School of Doing: Lessons From Theater Master Gerald Freedman ” a 2017 book by Isaac Klein. “On Saturday morning  I could do another Jewish service. On Sunday  I could do usually two churches. An early Mass  Presbyterian or Episcopalian  and in late afternoon there would be another Mass. And with five services  I could live off that for the next week.” He was hired to design and paint scenery at a summer stock company in Massachusetts and then  in 1952  to direct “As You Like It” at Equity Library Theater in New York. Someone from Columbia Pictures saw it and gave him a contract that took him to Hollywood  where one of his first assignments was as dialogue director on “It Should Happen to You ” a George Cukor movie starring Judy Holliday. She became a friend. In 1956  when Ms. Holliday was hired for the musical “Bells Are Ringing” on Broadway  Jerome Robbins  the director  who Mr. Freedman said was intimidated by the star  hired him to assist on the production. “It was either to placate Judy or as insurance ” Mr. Freedman said. “I never knew which.” The partnership was Mr. Freedman’s big break. He was Mr. Robbins’s assistant again the next year on “West Side Story ” and in 1959 on “Gypsy.” He also served as a buffer between the actors and Mr. Robbins  who could be abrasive. “I went around repairing Jerry’s damage with actors ” Mr. Freedman was quoted as saying in “Dancing With Demons: The Life of Jerome Robbins” (2001)  by Greg Lawrence. “I don’t mean that in a negative way. It was just because he didn’t know how to talk with them.” By 1960  Mr. Freedman was working with Mr. Papp. He directed a well-received “The Taming of the Shrew” that year for the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park. In 1964  Mr. Papp named Mr. Freedman artistic director of the Shakespeare Festival and announced his intention to include contemporary fare. One result was the rock musical “Hair ” with a book by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and music by Galt MacDermot. Mr. Freedman was assigned to direct the premiere  which was to open in Mr. Papp’s new space on Lafayette Street in Manhattan. It was a rocky trip to opening night. “We recognized its great energy and exuberance of spirit ” Mr. Freedman said in a 2008 talk at the Kennedy Center in Washington. “The challenge was to give it structure without destroying its energy.” His efforts were partly successful. “The director  Gerald Freedman  has not been able to impose any unity on the show — this hair is strictly untrimmed — but he has helped to bring out the natural vitality of both the piece and the very young performers ” Clive Barnes wrote in his review in The New York Times. But the birthing process had opened rifts with the book writers; when the show went to Broadway the next year  Tom O’Horgan was the director. Mr. Freedman’s opera work included the world premiere of “Beatrix Cenci” by Alberto Ginastera  with a libretto by William Shand  at the Kennedy Center in 1971  part of the opening festivities for that complex. He directed the same work in 1973 at City Opera in New York. He continued to direct after taking the North Carolina post  staging more than 30 productions there. He leaves no immediate survivors. For a 2017 podcast for WFDD  a public radio station in Winston-Salem  Mr. Freedman was asked about his legacy. “I’m most proud of the way I’ve opened up so many actors to what acting really is ” he said. “They have talent  they have intelligence  they have imagination  but they have to add a reality. That’s the essence of anything they do. And that’s it  really. Reality. “It sounds very simple  but it’s very difficult.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/obituaries/01Freedman1/merlin_171151878_79b4ae11-7da0-4443-996a-8290ae337bbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-neil-genzlinger/author-neil-genzlinger-thumbLarge.jpg 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus.html, opinion, You Shouldn’t Have to Risk Your Life to Vote, Holding a primary election in a pandemic  as Wisconsin plans to do on Tuesday  will suppress turnout and endanger public health., Supported by Holding a primary election in a pandemic  as Wisconsin plans to do on Tuesday  will suppress turnout and endanger public health. By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. On Tuesday  hundreds of thousands of voters in Wisconsin will be forced to choose between exercising their constitutional right to vote and safeguarding their own lives  not to mention the lives of their loved ones  their neighbors and poll workers across the state. That’s the predicament in which Republican state lawmakers have placed Wisconsinites — who have been under a stay-at-home order since March 25 — by refusing to agree to postpone the state’s April 7 presidential primary or to give all voters the option to cast a ballot by mail. Republicans control both chambers of Wisconsin’s Legislature. The stay-at-home order  issued by Gov. Tony Evers  bars people from leaving their homes except for food or medical needs  or to care for a family member or other vulnerable person. When they do go out  they must stay six feet away from other people — a near-impossible task at the polls. “There is no way for us to abide by those guidelines and at the same time administer an in-person election ” said the mayor of Green Bay  Eric Genrich. As of Friday  1 730 Wisconsinites had tested positive for Covid-19  and 37 had died. Governor Evers  a Democrat  initially supported holding the election as scheduled. In late March  after the state’s coronavirus cases soared above 700  he called for absentee ballots to be mailed to all state residents. On Friday afternoon  he made a last-ditch effort  calling the Legislature to meet in a special session on Saturday to consider legislation that would switch the state to all-mail voting  with a May 26 deadline for returning ballots. Yet Republican lawmakers appear to be forging ahead with Tuesday’s vote  which includes many state and local races — and  crucially  a fight for a seat on the State Supreme Court  which already has a Republican majority. It’s no surprise that front-line election workers  who come face to face with hundreds if not thousands of voters  are balking. Roughly 7 000 poll workers have said they won’t show up for fear of being infected with the coronavirus. Who could blame them? Many are older and at increased risk from an infection. As a result of the walkout  however  more than 100 precincts will have no poll workers. In Milwaukee  which usually operates 180 polling sites  fewer than 12 may be open on Tuesday. Because Wisconsin law requires at least three election workers to be stationed at each polling site  Governor Evers said he would deploy National Guard troops to do the job if necessary. Meanwhile  poll workers who plan to be present on Tuesday are taking whatever protective measures they can. Some are fashioning sneeze guards by propping sheets of plexiglass between card tables. Others are considering wrapping voting booths in plastic. This is insane  and utterly unnecessary. Fifteen states  including four with primaries scheduled for this coming week  have already postponed their elections; several have canceled all in-person voting and are relying solely on mail-in ballots. On Thursday the Democratic National Committee pushed back its national convention  which is scheduled to be held in Milwaukee  from July to August. Republicans insist that widespread mail voting would be an “invitation for voter fraud ” even though evidence suggests fraud is actually lower in states with all-mail balloting. They also argue it would be logistically impossible to print and mail so many ballots before Tuesday. If so  then why not just push back the election  as Mr. Evers has proposed? The answer can only be that Republican legislators don’t want people to vote. These are the same Republicans  you might recall  who in 2011 gerrymandered Wisconsin’s legislative district maps so egregiously that they were able to win more than 60 percent of the seats while losing the statewide popular vote to Democrats. These are the same Republicans who  with that ill-gotten majority  passed a strict voter-ID law that denied ballot access to black and Latino Wisconsinites at far higher rates than whites. The law reduced turnout in 2016 by 200 000 votes from 2012  in a key battleground state that Donald Trump won by fewer than 23 000. And these are the same Republicans who  knowing that Wisconsin could be a decisive state in the 2020 election  are hoping to lock in a state judge’s recent purge of more than 230 000 voters  disproportionately from Democratic-voting areas. The judge’s ruling  which targeted voters believed to have moved  has been appealed to the State Supreme Court. On Thursday  a federal judge declined to delay the primary  but he extended the deadline for returning absentee ballots and loosened the requirement that ballots be signed by a witness. These fixes don’t come close to creating the conditions for a fair election  but they are both clearly necessary given the more than one million absentee ballots that have been requested — a number that is many times higher than average and is already overwhelming understaffed elections offices. Republican lawmakers immediately appealed the ruling. In their zeal to ram through this vote  Republicans are subjecting Wisconsinites to the worst of both worlds: a turnout that will be sharply reduced because so many voters will continue to do the right thing and abide by the stay-at-home order  and yet one that will still be large enough to inundate the few precincts that will be open  and expose untold numbers of people to potential infection. Turnout is likely to be especially lower in Democratic-leaning cities like Milwaukee  which holds a large majority of the state’s minority voters and which has been hit hardest by the pandemic. Wisconsin Republicans aren’t outliers in their attempts to make voting harder. Republicans across the country have known for years that they win when fewer people vote. But what they used to say quietly has now become a central element of the party’s platform. Last year  the Senate majority leader  Mitch McConnell  called a proposal to make Election Day a holiday a “power grab” by Democrats — essentially admitting that if voting were easier  Republicans would suffer at the polls. The point was made explicit this week by Georgia’s House speaker  David Ralston  who opposed a push for mail-in ballots to be sent to every registered voter on the ground that it would encourage more people to vote. “This will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia ” Mr. Ralston said in a local news interview. “This will certainly drive up turnout.” And there was President Trump himself  who functions as the Republican id  venting on “Fox & Friends” about voter-friendly provisions that House Democrats had included in a draft of the coronavirus stimulus package. “The things they had in there were crazy ” Mr. Trump said. “They had levels of voting  that if you ever agreed to it  you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” The only good that could come of this travesty would be the demonstration of what happens when huge numbers of voters can’t cast a ballot  either in person or by mail. If you are concerned about voter turnout becoming a nationwide problem in November’s general election — and you should be — pay attention to what happens in Wisconsin’s benighted primary. Republicans hope it will be a harbinger of our future. All Americans who care about democracy need to ensure that it isn’t. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html, opinion, Social Distancing Is a Privilege, The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed., Supported by The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist People like to say that the coronavirus is no respecter of race  class or country  that the disease Covid-19 is mindless and will infect anybody it can. In theory  that is true. But  in practice  in the real world  this virus behaves like others  screeching like a heat-seeking missile toward the most vulnerable in society. And this happens not because it prefers them  but because they are more exposed  more fragile and more ill. What the vulnerable portion of society looks like varies from country to country  but in America  that vulnerability is highly intersected with race and poverty. Early evidence from cities and states already shows that black people are disproportionately affected by the virus in devastating ways. As ProPublica reported  in Milwaukee County  Wis.  as of Friday morning  81 percent of the deaths were black people. Black people make up only 26 percent of that county. transcript I will be discussing today the disproportionate impact that the Coronavirus COVID. My team is having on the African-American community basically vulnerable populations  but after making use of those vulnerable populations. And that has been a subject. If you have been reading a subject my last two columns also such a lot of my social media content. I’m particularly frustrated by lack of data National data data in the major hotspots like New York. So we’re going to be talking about that today. I will confess this that if this is I don’t think that I’ve ever gone live on Twitter. So hopefully this goes well. So there’s that. And so what I’m going to do this. You get me questions. I will answer questions as they come up. There was some prepare. I didn’t I didn’t think there were great questions. So I’m just going to ask the questions live. So since I don’t have a question. Yeah  I will start with this comment  which is I do not understand the lack of race specific data being made available nationwide. I understand why it’s not available in New York. It should be there. And because what it does is that it informs people that you are not an exhilarating factor to your primary factor. I believe that that changes behavior. Could you say yes  that behavior should be changed anyway. There are national press conferences every day. You should have it. Maybe so but I think once you know that you are a primary target it changes a lot. So here we have questions that I miss that question. Sorry about that. I missed that  which I want to start with to start try to read some of these. I don’t have one coming up yet. In particular  I don’t understand New York state’s absence of this data. I understand your city’s axis theta tell people who’s most affected. I think it. I think it saves lives actually. Right now  I see people who say. Maybe start keeping the race specific. Do you do you think you killed 19 targets people of color coding 19 does not have a brain. It hasn’t happened. No moral no consciousness nothing. What I do believe is that viruses will settle onto the most vulnerable populations and have their largest impact on those populations. That means that if you have a society where there are built and inequities that have existed in this particular case for centuries and those cumulative inequities are what the virus finds then the virus will settle into that most vulnerable population that becomes the problem. So what you. So the question then becomes not one of targeting  but one of the virus finding a population that has been already targeted by negative social policy. That is what I believe that we are facing. What a solution. A lot of people are dying right. So that’s a bigger question. The first thing I believe is that you just need people need to know hearing people say sunlight is the best disinfectant just the that’s the mere knowledge that it’s me. This is not about  it used to be about everybody. But disproportionate it’s about me my dad  my brother  my sister. It changes people’s relationship to the virus. And what have now this is an incredible vacuum is a vacuum of data. It’s also a vacuum of imagery right. So There are no mass gatherings. There are no people who came. There are no funerals to film really. And I thought  wow can maybe just save southern states are primed for this. And I know what you’re saying is black people because everything they were describing was about black people. They just were saying black people. So I said  oh my god. So I’m not sure who was seeing who was seeing this coming. But it is you do know that your people are sicker. You do know that part of the reason they’re sick is because of you. I’m never going to let these southern governors off the hook for not expanding Obamacare when they could not expand not accepting Obamacare and thinking when they could have not expanding Medicaid  which wouldn’t cost them anything like the idea that these poor people if you were to say for legal reasons I’m not going to expand this unless you live. We’ll give you Medicaid  which will help you live. Which will we know is going to make more. Keep more of you sick. That is unforgivable to me right. So they knew that. Do you think mass testing will ever happen. I don’t know if we’ll ever get to mass testing. I’m not sure that they’re pushing hard enough to get the mass testing what sweeting what Sweden. I don’t know what that means anti-racism public health research. We’ve been screening disks for weeks. No one’s listening to us. I don’t know that it’s all right. That’s why Trump administration is lagging to send help to certain states like me or that could be I don’t know what the rationale is there. But I do believe politics is in intertwined in this epidemic. Absolutely They will get mass testing because they don’t it’s my glass. My glasses. By the way I’m concerned with exacerbation policing black people who have to work in the name of helping. Well  so there are a lot of people. So there a lot of factors that intersect here. So not only is your health poorer some of that is connected to race it doesn’t mean to get where there’s personal agency your choice is being made. But it is connected to health that really were this. There are very few accidents in America. People know that there are ghettos in America because America created ghettos by design people. There was people live in certain areas of cities primarily because that is where the cities find them to live. Great people didn’t wake up and say  oh  you know what. I really like to live in the poorest most dangerous part of the city. No that was by design health policy or the withholding of full inclusive health care is by design in economic inequities or historically by design. Everything from freeing slaves and refusing to give the reparation while at the same time by an act of Congress giving away millions of acres of land to peasants from Europe in the Midwest and the west. Right and it’s huge. You trace it from there all the way everything from  you know  to a minimum wage war the first federal minimum wage it was enacted they basically the compromise go through and exclude almost every field in which black people dominate. That’s what you get typically by the way. So did this economic inequity is a structural problem. You add on top of that lack of access to adequate health care  which is connected to economics but also in the post Obamacare era is connected to an overt political action you add to that suspicions around health care because you have the Tuskegee experiment that you have forced sterilization. And so there are reasons that people are leery. And you add on top of that  the fact that only one in five black people one in six Hispanic people have the option of working from home. So they have to go out into this craziness with all of those underlying conditions and bring whatever they touch interact with back into spaces where their relatives have those same underlying conditions. It is a recipe for disaster. It is exacerbating existing issues. OK Do. How do we put pressure on public officials to force them to test in the vulnerable communities. We keep yelling. I don’t I don’t even know what else to do. First of all  I’m just not I’m not understanding why liberal politicians foreigners are not screaming this at the top of their lungs what where what is that like  OK  what else we have here. Remember the pass Chaves remember the past change the future  though Trump blocked it. OK I don’t really have a zeal for life anymore anyways. Well  OK. Anyway  I take this too  because what is AI don’t know that sir with this PTSD can possibly where do you think American journalism is failing at this moment. Let me tell you something. I am. I want to say this in as clear away as possible. We in journalism could see this. I’m really happy for ondaatje early saying this. I’m sure other people said things like this. But if you look at the major journalistic outlets in the country only in the last couple of days had they said  oh  there’s a alarming put a pro publica serious story a week ago  which is amazing. I think it’s about a week ago  I just need to see it. This is what’s happening. This idea that you have a television news network and cable and you see almost no representation of this. You see the only people talking. Don’t look like  what the early data suggests might be the most impacted populations you hear the subjects that they’re talking around are not this specific subject. The idea that that even when victims are shown barely are those people the survivors of people of color. What OK. I am I’m incensed by that. I’m shocked by that because  again  I will go back to this. I believe that once you show people that their primary targets behavior changes. If you report this in ways that are more representative of what is actually happening on the ground. You will actually help to save lives. If you do not do that. You are contributing to the loss of life. We need facts and data. Yes  we do. We need all the data that they have. And they are collecting all sorts of data. Well  it’s gotten way too fast for me. Let me see. Why have you been on CNN discussing this. Well TV works like this. You go on television  when you’re invited. I don’t have a show. And I have a network. So whenever anybody who’s in danger who is at risk everyone’s in danger vulnerable people are more at risk. Come on Charles. Organize and lead. Get the criminal Trump junta out of. OK  listen. This is writing is an action. So I believe that I am. This is my calling and this. I’m doing what I’m supposed to do. They’re different people who have different functions in the world. This is mine is to bear witness. So that’s what I’m good. Thanks for bringing the awareness OK. Is more television stuff media doesn’t think minorities face faces. I don’t. I’m really having a hard time. We need to nationalize the supply chain to make things easier on all production. Absolutely I think that is absolutely true. Do you think they meant to hide data. I don’t know what the rationale for not giving all this data in a this is a data world that we live in and that when those people die. They collect every bit of data when they’re in when you’re admitted they collect a zillion points of data. So the FBI knew that you wouldn’t have. Of course  you have it. It would take one little one team of people inputting this and you’d have the results in a day. So the idea that we in the public do not have these data presents for us to analyze is insane. So yes  on that level  it is intentional. I know you have these data. Why can’t we feed them you know I’m not a conspiracy type of person. But I know you have it. So now you have to explain to me why we don’t see it. All right data. Let me see if I can slow this. OK  audience listening now. Here we go. You can tell him a novice here. All right. Should we stay away from black people since you’re telling being black is what they’re getting coded. OK kind of not smart question. However  it’s not that they’re getting coded because they’re black. Is that the inequities make them more vulnerable to any disease or disaster. This is why I took the question stumped. All right. Why do you feel they aren’t released. I have no idea whether or not releasing those data is baffling to me. Should journalism go after Trump in real time when he disrespects it. OK So let me just say this. The people who get the audience with Trump are in those press conferences you see those are reporters right. Their mission is very different than ours. You need to be able to go back there. I mean  it’s just complicated now. That’s why I appreciate them so much. That’s why I could never be a White House correspondent because that would be the day that I would lose my job. Like I’m just you know what I could handle. They would go. So I can win to sort of scrolling. I stopped it when all heart conditions are being treated as coded positive here in Kings County Seattle. Well  not something that I have someone had alerted me to is that a lot of people that heart conditions are a problem for when you get the virus  but also that people who get the virus because of lack of oxygen can have heart attack. So I’m a doctor. So I don’t want to get too deep into that. But I think all of the that was and it did not. It blanked off. So we’re starting all over. So if you have questions  I will be reading questions that we’ll be answering questions. I guess we’ll do this for the next 10 minutes or so  we think we’ve already done it for about 30 minutes. What about people who don’t have symptoms and not getting tested. That’s why is getting back the idea that what we need to have is vastly more testing improved testing available to everyone. The idea of only testing people who presents sentence is actually not sufficient. Any more questions we’ll get to those. I don’t know where it was when this thing cut off. If I can remember where that was. We’ll get back to it. Would you discuss social distancing being a function of privilege. So that was my last column. And that column was about the idea that people keep saying  you know  that the most potent tool we now have a social listening that is absolutely true. But then they follow up with that is the one thing that’s under your control. But that is actually not completely true. There are a lot of people who cannot do this is a privilege to be able to work at home is a privilege to be able to be in your home away for everyone else. And also have to be there and be comfortable there. And the life. Those are all positions. One study that I put in the last columns is that one in five African-Americans one in six Hispanics cannot work from home. And yet once you think about it  it’s obvious if you touch people for a living in any way you cut their hair you make you do their hair. If you massage therapist if you are someone who takes care of children or in eldercare you can’t do that from home. If you are a person who is a Gardener or a person who built houses or maintain house to clean house. You can’t do that from your house. You should just go down the line. Most of these service kind of industries you can’t do it from home. And these people if you’re living right on the margin are kind of underwater on a good day and you have maybe yourself. But also maybe children in your home and you still have to put food on the table. You have to make a real choice I can’t go home. I don’t go in May lose his little job. I need to cook food for these kids. It becomes a problem. So you see people in these pictures on these crowded subways and buses stop being judgmental because person’s story maybe they’re making the toughest decision they can make. I go out. Get exposed to the virus and may bring it home or I go out and make this our stay home. Don’t go out. Make this money and my kids are hungry. So it’s an impossible thing and people’s we passed this stimulus package and people on the low end of the income spectrum are supposed to get you up to $500. Yeah but it’s don’t come yet. And by one estimate  if you are unbanked meaning you do not have a bank account. It could take up to four months for you to get your money. 25  I think that 25% of people who make less than $50 000 a year don’t have bank though twice as many black people as white people. The danger. What are you up to waiting for a check and the kids are hungry today. Right So it is it’s very difficult. Let’s see if we can reach some of these your wise hard decision. OK What else we have here. Depending on your job decisions. But staying at home  get food from churches and various food. OK What does that mean. I’m going to stay at home  get food for churches. That’s not a system that somebody can depend on. How does that work. If you live in bed sty or Harlem what. Are there enough churches delivering meals for every day that doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t make sense. And also we shouldn’t have to worry depend on a church to have food for your kids. If you’re a working person in America. What’s lost. I’m not sure where Joe Biden is right now. What is this not only by November. Probably not going to be over by November. I think the impacts for the election are severe. Not only in terms of if we reach the minimum that the most optimistic models show 100 000 to 200 000 people dead the other. But I’m sure a million people. I mean  like  who know right. So that’s just actual deaths. Right and if you’re saying that most of the people who die or are older people that is the group that is that votes most regularly. If the early data hold up in across the country. But they’re already happening in big states  including swing states right. And 40% to 70% of those dead are black people those people most regularly most passionately vote Democratic. So huge in terms of number dead. But now think about kind of sociological impact how many older you’re going to want to struggle out to a polling place if you’ve been stuck inside and been scared to go on not being near people is going to kill you. OK That’s huge. In addition  if it goes out to the election you could see the federal gun. I Trump doing what this somebody’s state legislatures the states have done  which is push back elections that would be enormous. Right So some of the primaries have already been could they change the date. Push it back a month or two. That’s huge. That’s huge. So I don’t know what’s going to happen in November. Also  I don’t know what’s going to happen with the cities. How do you take a census. How do you have a census in a year in which everybody’s being told to stay home. And if to death and nobody is really functioning in the way society normally functions. OK there is that what does we have here. Because we are a large percentage of cases become Guinea pigs for experimental drugs and treatments. I don’t know how it’s going to work. But they’re going to have to do the studies on somebody and it scares me to death. To be honest distance learning doesn’t work formularies. I don’t know what the data are on that. What we have here. Somebody says not no. No church is delivering hard. I don’t know if that’s true or not. But that’s a comedy. Talk about how food has come into play. This is a big thing for me because I’ve seen so much changing of people in minority communities who were at eating establishments right. Either it was a local fast food chicken place or a fish market or whatever. And people say  oh my god  this is why you’re not behaving you’re not doing anything. OK could be. And if some people who there who should be throwing caution to the wind. I think that’s the law. People regardless of race are doing it. But I would you just think about this scenario. All right. You don’t make enough money. You live in a place that is too small with too many people. Your food storage system exists consist of a refrigerator if you’re lucky and the freezer portion is about this big right. You can’t afford to do what a lot of people are doing. We’re sheltering in place. A lot of groceries go inside stay in there can afford you that even if you could afford it. Where would you store the meats and the fresh vegetables. Second in this food desert areas you may not have access to great fresh meat or fresh fish. And so fresh fruit and vegetables. So the idea is like you could just get enough of the packages stored away whatever income doesn’t exist for you. And so you do you have a space where have enough of it fresh fruit and vegetables or they’re incredibly expensive which they’re relatively expensive anyway. But you’re surrounded by nutrient deficient junk food that is incredibly cheap and you because of that  because human beings will not starve themselves on foot. I mean  you know  you’re not going to starve to death on purpose. So you’re going to try to eat. So very often just make do just the path of least resistance is just grab something and go. And so people do that. And that are the function of poverty. So I just I it just really irks me when I see people being so just mental about how poor people are eating to stay alive. So that’s just what it is. I have back the questions. All right. It’s getting real in New Orleans I’ve heard multiple ambulance sirens this morning. You know this is a very interesting topic. So I saw my neighborhood in new in New York. It got super gentrified. I moved there 20 years ago. This is like little interesting mixed bohemian place mixed race. Now it’s hard to find people of color in my neighborhood. That’s true. I was there. This past weekend. I’m in Atlanta now. I know. I didn’t hear a single analyst endless in my place in it in Atlanta and in midtown. I don’t hear a single ambulance. When I talk to my friends who live in Harlem the best died Fort Greene Brooklyn. They report. I hear ambulances all day long. Right as part of the antidote then the anecdote of black and brown people being more effective. And this is a crisis there that people in Midtown Atlanta Park Slope  Brooklyn just don’t even see it invisible to you that there’s a crisis happening in those neighborhoods. OK somebody said  but the census is online. Do you understand you do understand that there are a lot of poor people who still have subpar access to digital access that when you are struggling to survive and pay the bills and put food on the table filling out the census form may not be top of your list. You do understand that the impact. This is having even if the census is online. I think that should be top of mind. Comcast and horizon are offering the internet. Low income households. That’s a great thing. Still you know hopefully more people take advantage of what I’ve seen over years is that even when you offer things when people are in distress they don’t always take advantage because they’re so focused on the existential threat that everything else seems to follow the don’t know. I don’t know the truth of these questions. Some of these have statements and a measure of truth. So I just want to get to things that Do you expect high crime rates because people have to eat right now crime is down. And in all these places where people are having to shelter in place. I think that that holds. But what we’re seeing is that people not only in America. There was great report on CNN. I think it was online that this was happening in people across the world. New Delhi Mexico Citi  you name a city with a large poor population. People were starting to reject the shelter in place and just going out because they needed to survive. If the survival is the need to survive is exacerbated dramatically to the point where people feel desperate. I don’t know what happens with us. We have the means  I’m not the only I don’t know what that means. It’s some of these I don’t know these questions the veracity of the statements examines questions. I live in midtown New York City confirm no sirens. That’s what I’ve been noticing loathing that I wanted to say about their city because I just I’ve said this once on an Instagram lot. I want to see this broadcast. I can understand the placement of field hospitals in the beginning when people thought that this was going to be primarily  I guess either a jet setting population impact at first a cruise population impacted first a spring breaking population impact at first all of which would be privileged economically impacted first skewing towards probably more white people right or thought that it was you know an 18 But that’s Trump. I was this Chinese virus whatever. But now that we have data. And it seems and we you know we don’t even have the data that says that racial data. But if you look at just the that what New York has published is zip code data. And it is in the borough’s most heavily looks like Hispanic and black community. And you look at where the field hospitals are. And it just makes you upset. So the USS comfort is a pure 90. That’s Hell’s Kitchen that’s in Manhattan. Muhammad is majority white only 6% and the people in Hell’s Kitchen are black. The  the Jacob Javits Center Hell’s Kitchen literally. They’re both on both of these hospitals or on the West Side Highway the comfort is in the dark on one side and the two because I’ve seen it on the side of st. And even though Manhattan is the kind of cultural economic center of the city. It is not the geographic center of the city. It is on the far west side or city. It is. But it’s far away. If you think about New York City like this. This is Manhattan. This is where the cases are. This is where the case end up in the Bronx. This is Brooklyn Queens. It is about as far away as you can get. From where this is hitting hardest in a white neighborhood in a white Barrio the median income in Hell’s Kitchen is about $100 000 a year. In the blackest parts of Brooklyn like bits dies half that if I have a heart attack. I have to go to the hospital nurse me. I can’t wait to have that be called it. And it would take me an hour to get from my part of Brooklyn or wherever. Deep in Brooklyn to Western highway the other field hospital in the heart is being built in Central Park  which is ringed by Uber wealthy white. These are not difficult. I can say half of them are already vacated the Hamptons or some other summer home that they have not even met. Why is it. Why is there a field hospital in Central Park. Why is there not a field hospital in one of the major parks like Prospect Park or in the Bronx or a Queens. All right let me to this morning’s questions. No sirens and Tribeca OK. The digital divide is real. That is true. Yes Now do people not have computers. But also many libraries are closed. The COVID 19 lot of people who report who need internet service go to the library domestic violence is up. That’s an important thing. Also the few services that they haven’t been shrink to a few locations. I had a friend who had this weird crazy thing with his neighbor some homophobic thing and the guys followed him and like bank. He escaped into a restaurant in Harlem. Guy banging on the door  I’m going to all the threats and things. So they call the cops. Police told him caught clothes you can’t get a restraining order. Nothing we can do. I subsequently found out that wasn’t true. You know cops come on. You gotta be better than this guys. But that there were limited locations where this could have is kind of an emergency thing that you have to you know. So it becomes harder to get a restraining order. I mean  all of that is compounded. So anyway have you seen that since. Georgia is my new home. Do you think Georgia your new home. Do you think 20 times in November. It’s possible. But on this Colbert thing I just I do believe that I’m seeing a lot less urgency here. This just anecdotally  I people I’m talking to. There just is not the same urgency as in New York. So I hope that people wake up a little bit too like this is going. It is coming everywhere. It’s a virus. There’s no until you have a vaccine. No stopping it. It’s in the population. It’s in the communities. It’s spread. You tamp it down. You You let about the break is going to come back because it is not thinking. It just is looking for bodies is looking for places that it can live. And it will jump and job and job and job until there is no one else to jump. So until there is a vaccine. It’s you know even if you have. But that’s treating it after you have it. So I think way. I think it’s getting late. So I’m going to take just one more question  and then we’re going to be done. does this report. I think the blog you know that. I’m just saying where New York City’s resources are may not have made sense in the beginning. It’s just that as we get data it seems like they make less and less sense. And it seems like you may have to move something like the ship. I don’t know what you know that the underwater terrain and but can be Parkway. But there are docks in Brooklyn. So I don’t know if it’s possible. But you know  last time I checked her what the number is now last time I checked  it was a 22 patients on the comfort and hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens where they have refrigerator trucks are back because the bodies are piling up. So fast they can’t get them up to the mortuaries or wherever something is not looking right. The optics of this are awful awful anyway. So I’ve done my part. And you please tune in to all this week here other of my colleagues discussing I guess part of their work in the columns and maybe something about this outbreak been really fun and see you guys later. As for Chicago  WBEZ reported Sunday that “70 percent of Covid-19 deaths are black ” and pointed out about surrounding Cook County  “While black residents make up only 23 percent of the population in the county  they account for 58 percent of the Covid-19 deaths.” The Detroit News reported last week  “At least 40 percent of those killed by the novel coronavirus in Michigan so far are black  a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of African-Americans in the Detroit region and state.” If this pattern holds true across other states and cities  this virus could have a catastrophic impact on black people in this country. And yet  we are still not seeing an abundance of news coverage or national governmental response that center on these racial disparities. Many states haven’t even released race-specific data on cases and deaths. The federal government hasn’t either. Partly for this reason  we are left with deceptive and deadly misinformation. The perception that this is a jet-setters’ disease  or a spring breakers’ disease  or a “Chinese virus” as President Trump likes to say  must be laid to rest. The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed. And  we must dispense with the callous message that the best defense we have against the disease is something that each of us can control: We can all just stay home and keep social distance. As a report last month by the Economic Policy Institute pointed out  “less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six Hispanic workers are able to work from home.” As the report pointed out  “Only 9.2 percent of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework  compared with 61.5 percent of workers in the highest quartile.” If you touch people for a living  in elder care or child care  if you cut or fix their hair  if you clean their spaces or cook their food  if you drive their cars or build their houses  you can’t do that from home. Staying at home is a privilege. Social distancing is a privilege. The people who can’t must make terrible choices: Stay home and risk starvation or go to work and risk contagion. And  this isn’t just happening here  it is happening with poor people around the world  from New Delhi to Mexico City. If they go to work  they must often use crowded mass transportation  because low-wage workers can’t necessarily afford to own a car or call a cab. Such is the life of the working poor  or those slightly above poverty  but still struggling. Our entire discussion around this virus is stained with economic elitism. In social media commentary about images of packed buses and crowds of delivery workers outside restaurants  people chastise black and brown people for not always being inside  but many of those doing the chastising do so from comfortable homes with sufficient money and food. People can’t empathize with what it truly means to be poor in this country  to live in a too-small space with too many people  to not have enough money to buy food for a long duration or anywhere to store it if they did. People don’t know what it’s like to live in a food desert where fresh fruit and vegetables are unavailable and nutrient-deficient junk food is cheap and exists in abundance. People are quick to criticize these people for crowding into local fast food restaurants to grab something to eat. Not everyone can afford to order GrubHub or FreshDirect. Furthermore  in a nation where too many black people have been made to feel that their lives are constantly under threat  the existence of yet another produces less of a panic. The ability to panic becomes a privilege existing among those who rarely have to do it. I wholeheartedly encourage everyone who can to stay home  but I’m also aware enough to know that not everyone can or will  and that it is not simply a pathological disregard for the common good. If you are sheltering in place in an ivory tower  or even a comfortable cul-de-sac or a smartly well-appointed apartment  and your greatest concern is boredom and leftover food  please stop scolding those scratching to survive.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html, opinion, This Is What Happens When a Narcissist Runs a Crisis, Trump’s catastrophic performance has as much to do with psychology as ideology., Supported by Trump’s catastrophic performance has as much to do with psychology as ideology. By Jennifer Senior Opinion columnist Since the early days of the Trump administration  an impassioned group of mental health professionals have warned the public about the president’s cramped and disordered mind  a darkened attic of fluttering bats. Their assessments have been controversial. The American Psychiatric Association’s code of ethics expressly forbids its members from diagnosing a public figure from afar. Enough is enough. As I’ve argued before  an in-person analysis of Donald J. Trump would not reveal any hidden depths — his internal sonar could barely fathom the bottom of a sink — and these are exceptional  urgent times. Back in October  George T. Conway III  the conservative lawyer and husband of Kellyanne  wrote a long  devastating essay for The Atlantic  noting that Trump has all the hallmarks of narcissistic personality disorder. That disorder was dangerous enough during times of prosperity  jeopardizing the moral and institutional foundations of our country. But now we’re in the midst of a global pandemic. The president’s pathology is endangering not just institutions  but lives. transcript So I’m the latest columnist to be joining the rotation of colonists over it opinion and it’s obviously a really peculiar time to join. OK And I used to be a daily book critic. I appear. Now  every Monday. I’ve written. I wrote a column today because it’s my day. Even though we lose track in quarantine and I wrote one last Monday to when I was here. And I’m going to be here to discuss them both. Thank you  everybody  for putting up for what was a really unbearable clumsily low tech snafu on my part. This is my second time using Periscope  and I’m at age appropriately dreadful at it anyway. So again  my name is Jennifer Senior let me. Let’s get right into it because I wrote two columns today that I’m eager to write two columns. This past week that I’m eager to discuss the first. So the one that came out  it  I ended up getting a lot of responses to it. And I have a lot to say in response to those responses. But let’s start with this. I am absolutely 100% preoccupied with the idea that Donald J Trump fits perfectly like heat maps perfectly onto the personality traits of someone with narcissistic personality disorder. And it would be one thing if it were a margin call or if from the menu of 10 things that one could choose to look at. You know he fed only three of the four. I’m sorry he’s not. I’m sorry seven of the 10 or 5 of the 10. He hits all of them and psychologists have been talking about this for a while. It was a controversial opinion initially to even come out and say  this because psychiatrist I have a rule that you shouldn’t actually diagnose someone that you haven’t personally evaluated. The trouble with that is that people who have narcissistic personality when you’re face to face with them. It’s not that they present all that differently. They don’t have any capacity herself. You know reflection or introspection. So my theory is that in a  if you saw Trump in a one on one clinical setting you’re just going to get more Trump. He’s basically just a Patricia doll of nesting hollow Trump sees the same person. And I think over the years  this taboo has kind of gone away. I think more and more psychiatrists are perfectly willing to say that he every personality trait he has is sort of consistent with narcissistic Melissa also been writing it for a while most notably George Conway Kellyanne Conway’s husband. He is a never Trumper her and a lawyer and he writes for The Atlantic and he was sort of the definitive decisive piece last October talking about the fact  it looks this is what this man has. Let’s call it what it is. And you. Let’s if it walks like a duck let’s do the definitive what’s it walks like a duck piece. And he did. So what I wrote about today was all right. Well  we’ve sent somebody with a narcissistic personality to the White House and now he’s running a crisis. So what does that look like. Ana’s is this camp capable really of actually managing a crisis. And here are the obstacles  I think I mean  there. And by the way  just as an aside  this is something that didn’t make it into my column. But I wish I’d had space for it celebrities already are as you might imagine inclined toward narcissism. They tend to be more narcissistic just as a rule. It makes sense. They think that attention functions as a narcotic so many of them. It is also people who crave attention obviously enjoy being famous. But there was a study done in 2006 that showed that the kinds of celebrities who were the most narcissistic were not surprisingly reality TV celebrities make sense. So OK  here we have like a perfect storm. We’ve got Donald Trump. He was a reality television star. And he has been sent to the White House and narcissists are not very well equipped to handle crises. This is  in fact  the problem right. So here is  I think  a few of the reasons why. First of all  they are highly delusional about their own capabilities and what that means is that they are very threatened by expertise. They’re not they’re highly disinclined to trust anyone who may indeed know more about the problem at hand. The crisis that they’re facing. So what it means is that if you think about it  right now  Donald Trump could assemble the finest minds in America  the most imaginative minds in America we’re facing an enormous economic crisis. It’s looming it’s already upon us. 6.6 million unemployment claims just filed right. This is going to be formidable formidable and scary. He could enlist anyone he had to call Larry Summers or Bob Rubin who ran the Treasury Department during two previous recessions. Right they have a lot of experience. Does he do this. No disaster preparedness. You could speak to virtually anyone who’s handled any kind of natural disaster before in the past. And who does he farm out most of the disaster preparedness responsibilities too. Jared Kushner I mean Jared Kushner doesn’t hold any portfolio for anything. So I think my point is that he hands it. He is doling out responsibility to people who don’t threaten him. What tends to happen to narcissists is they surround themselves with a gallery of sycophants that’s they surround themselves with people who wouldn’t dare contradict them. And this is dangerous when what you need right now are the smartest people in the room not the people who are afraid and who are there to mollify a president. So what you have is this very awkward situation where you have a few experts who are kind of you’ve got Dr. g you’ve that Dr. Burke. Yes  I know. I need to brush my hair just to all the trolls out there. I just want to say  you know what a lot of us are going to emerge without or without perfect hair without perfect highlights anyway. And he is a narcissist and a sadist combined. Yes unfortunately  I think that there is a great deal. And there is an element of sadism in what he does anyhow. And I wouldn’t focus on people’s looks. It’s a bad look  whoever you are  you know  this is not a time to care. Ignore trolls. Yes Always true. One should anyhow. I might give myself  my own haircut. And dye my hair pink because why not. Who’s going to see my kid can do it. That would be lovely. Right you get probably gratified about to cut my hair anyway. So I think the point is what you really want is lock them and their sex. Love the love. I’m getting back you. They’re all women of course  we’re saying. Who cares about your hair. So I think let’s go back to what’s important  which is that right now  Trump needs to be listening to experts. They are the most important people to be listening to. He’s got two on hand. We know incontrovertibly that Anthony she knows a lot. Thank you for loving my hair. It looks nice usually. Anyway thank you. Anthony she is exactly who you want in this crisis and it’s interesting about him. This is fascinating. He knows that you’re doing great. Please keep going. Thank you so Anthony 4G as he is. It’s an interesting exercise in minefield walking right when you were managing a narcissist. The paradox here that all of us are all reckoning with all of us are reckoning with is that Trump’s advisors are trying to and all the governors right who are managing this crisis they are all trying to create a safe space for the president when he needs to create a safe nation for all of us. Right So you’ve got somebody like Anthony valjean who knows very well  what the data looks like and he actually understand something about infectious diseases and contagion right. He’s an infectious disease expert and he understands the way that you know kind of the vectors and paths that all of these things take. So have any power to be president. I mean  at this moment why. Why ever not. You know I mean  certainly he should be answering the questions at the press conferences. I think that is definitely true. And I always choke a little when he starts to speak. And then President Trump cuts him off because the productive thinking and the only useful information we can really get from the epidemiologists and the doctors. So what’s interesting about Fortune’s approach to Trump in my view  is that the way that he actually still manages to disseminate informal information  which is critical. We all need to hear it is not by humiliating Trump because that’s the best strategy you never want to humiliate a narcissist because narcissists secretly don’t actually have skyscraper only high self-esteem the way we think of it narcissists secretly are. They live in fear of being exposed. They are very anxious about people realizing what they don’t know. Their egos are kind of frail as foam. They’re very easy to burst. So what do they do. They Yeah  no  I vote Democrat. It’s true. I absolutely. What are the chances the chances are good. It is absolutely true. However  I would never say any of this. I would point out about George w bush who was conscientious after September 11 in the immediate aftermath I didn’t think he should we should I I don’t understand the Iraq war is another story. But I do believe that his public handling of September 11 was actually quite conscientious and responsible. Giuliani was extremely responsible in the aftermath of September 11. There are all sorts of Republican governors right now who are stepping up in beautiful and marvelous ways and Republican local officials. This is not a partisan point of view. This is all about how you manage giving truthful information. So to go back to the Fantasy what I think is fascinating about him is rather than correct Donald Trump  which he wouldn’t respond well to what fat he does is he says the fact. That’s it. That’s it. And in sticking with this just the facts  ma’am kind of approach every time Trump says something  and it’s exaggerated. He exaggerates the potential for new therapies. He says that there are more tests available than in fact  are. What that does is he jumps in and he starts to speak. And he just he doesn’t say  no  you’re wrong. He just says  well  here’s what we know so far about these therapies. They’re still untested. We’re looking we’re waiting. We hope he comes out and says  well  the tests they’re enroute we can’t do them in bulk in the way that we’d like. But they’re another positive development. Whenever Trump says that he thinks that the fact that the coronavirus will kind of evaporate that there’ll be some kind of seasonal cure that he jumps in and says  I wish that were the case too. But I don’t think so. So I think that he is providing a national model for how you handle misinformation and wishful thinking coming from the Oval Office right. Because that’s what we’re getting right now is a lot of wishful thinking and misinformation can narcissist feel empathy. The short answer is no. The whole world is a reflecting pool. That’s the problem with narcissists. Right And it makes it hard because of what your job is to be is in part to disseminate information that is in part to kind of shore up that to mollify the nerves of an anxious public. Theoretically Cuomo is very good at this right  Andrew Cuomo does a very good job of kind of coming out and saying  look  I suffer too. My brother is suffering. He’s covered positive lots leaders net you know all over the globe. We’re very good at doing this. The queen did a marvelous job of this yesterday. Angela Merkel did a marvelous job of it yesterday. Why is it wrong to hope that these drugs are working when other countries other countries are not necessarily having great success. There’s a lot. We have to wait for a real body of data to know whether these drugs are working. Actually  that’s not true yet the efficacy of these drugs is not yet proven. It’s anecdotal and that’s what’s upsetting. So what you don’t want is people touting these drugs and giving everyone false hope. You don’t want people hoarding them. And let’s see what personality types are these leaders. So thank you. It is my second time in Periscope. I’m being told welcome by people young. It’s probably obvious that I’m a newbie anyway. So I think that what we have to just be careful about when you’ve got somebody because here’s the other thing narcissists are quite prone to exaggeration. Right So they’re going to be speaking with great invalidity and great enthusiasm about the things that they’ve done and the things that await without actually restraining themselves and hewing strictly to the facts. And that  of course  is everything. It matters a huge a great deal. So these are some things that I think that we ought to be highly mindful of anyway. OK So if you’re just joining us  I’m Jennifer Senior. I am one of the newest I am I think the newest kind of columnist at The New York Times to be thrown into the rotation at an awfully peculiar time I appear on Monday’s also now just sort of look at some of the lost my comments. I’m going to look at some people had some wonderful kind of responses and some heartbreaking responses to the last column that I did not. This Monday. But the previous one that talked about something that’s very near and dear to my heart called moral injury. I just want to speak to something somebody is saying this. And I know that they’re being kind of troll ish but I think this is actually a matter of public importance saying that the media is trying to sow panic. We’re not. I think you should listen to the doctors on this. I think the doctors are the ones who have the real answers and we are listening to the doctors. And we took what Deborah parks are following the data the projections is right now is that if we behave ourselves as a nation 100 000 people in the United States will die  which rivals you know cancer rates and cancer fatality rates. And it’s not good. It will make coronavirus one of the leading killers in the United States. That’s if we behave ourselves and lots of states were not behaving themselves. They were behaving poorly. And what’s happening in New York is a harbinger. It’s not an exception. This is going to for better or for worse sweep across the country. And it’s going to happen at different rates at different times. Hopefully we will be prepared or medical professionals will be prepared. We’ll have more masks. We’ll have more ventilators because this is happening in kind of you know in this syncopated way. It’s not happening. It’s happening kind of in waves and a sine curve across the country. But I don’t think to accuse us of spreading this information. I think is itself. It’s grotesquely irresponsible. And I wish that people would stop. I wish they would desist to call this a hoax. I mean  I think that in the aftermath when historians are watching Fox newsreels of people saying that this is now worse than the flu  it’s a nothing doctor  you know  Trump saying that this is just going to go away. There’s going to be a real archival there’s going to be a real of people saying things that are just so kind of flat flawed Lee incorrect. So I don’t think that any of us are sowing panic and we are trying to report how many are recovered instead of only deaths. The problem is that the deaths are actually still imminent and the recovery rates right now are deeply unimpressive. You know the coronavirus actually lingers for a while. And also  if we have better data out there. If we had had more aggressive testing and more tests in place we’d have a much better sense of who’s had the virus and for how long  and how many have recovered. But we were very  very far behind on this question. So unfortunately  it’s hard to know we’re rates. It’s hard to even know penetration rates. We can’t actually know how how widespread coronavirus is at the moment. So we are actually doing the best. I think reporting on the data that’s available to us and believe it or not  the doctors are in the same position they are as hungry for data  especially about the United States as we are. If you want to hear more damage about the. We want to hear more about the damage that a narcissistic leader can cause. Well  I think that the tools are many. Misinformation is a big one. I think turning the conversation toward himself is another one when really the car everybody wants to hear that the world is going to return to normal and be OK. What he does is talk about how he’s number one on Facebook and isn’t that fantastic. And he gives himself a 10 out of 10 for handling this crisis. And isn’t that wonderful. And those are  I think the last thing that people want to hear during a crisis. I think people are sort of alarmed when they hear leaders talk about themselves and not about the citizenry in general life. That’s their job. So anyway now I just want to go back and talk about the column that I did last week  which I’m very invested in. And that’s about the mental health of our health care professionals. They’re already in a lot of physical danger. Thank you. Who is ever giving me the shout out of love. Oh my goodness. Thank you. And how can reporters address his mental health in the context of a Presser. That’s a great question. All right. I’ll go back and answer that. The answer is we shouldn’t carry them live narcissists aren’t inclined to give the truth. They’re inclined to exaggerate they’re inclined to give falsehoods they are inclined to speak in temporarily and to pick fights they sow division. He picks fights with the press corps and he picks fights with governors. So one of the things that we can do strategically is just robbed him of his oxygen supply  which is attention. There’s definitely one way to do this. And then you send people into the room to cover it. But they come away and they just summarize what the main news points are which will be given by foul be given by Burke’s be given possibly by the Veterans Affairs director or the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I mean  there are people who can actually give you materially useful goods. You just don’t need to carry it live because what you’re essentially getting is an infomercial that’s filled with spotty information anyway. And I don’t know where the times broadcast them lives. It’s a great question. I don’t know. That’s the newsrooms. It’s a call from the newsroom. And I’m befuddled diet myself  I understand why c-span doesn’t because they’ve got kind of a historical and archival obligation. I don’t know why the networks doesn’t do it. I don’t know why the networks do it. And I’m not sure why we do. Going back to. So again  Jennifer Senior net latest columnist I just got to tell you the story that I did that. I’m invested in  which is the health care the mental health of our health care professionals. Let’s start with the fact that they are inhaling a greater viral load. So doctors are going to get sicker at a faster rate than the rest of us because it turns out there is a direct relationship to how much of this disease  you are exposed to and how sick you get. And a lot of these doctors and EMTs a nurses a lot of first responders are on are overwhelmed by virus in spite of even if they’ve got the best PPE in the world. If you’re intimidating someone they are just obviously coughing up a huge amount of virus. So I fear no one for their physical safety. I fear it. So much. And they’re short on supply. So they are often wearing the same goggles. The same face shields the same N95 masks all day long. They are already marching into a battle without sufficient ammunition. So the equivalent of dropping our show soldiers on Utah Beach without bullets. I mean  it’s really frightening stuff. What’s going on right now. And so here is you know what I fear next. It’s not just their physical health. I mean  in Italy. We’ve already got some data about how like this. You know doctors are something like 14% of the infected. What I’m nervous about next is our mental health because if indeed  we do face this ventilator shortage  which everyone is anticipating the New England Journal of Medicine just had a piece talking about this  that it’s inevitable basically by their estimate. Best case scenario  we have 1.4 ventilators per person who needs them. Worst case scenario  we have 31 people per one ventilator. So sorry. Sorry we have 1.4 people per ventilator. Worst case scenario. 31 people per ventilator. Those are numbers that I just they’re goose pimples only awful. They are terrible numbers. And they were I think trying to work out in this particular piece  which I found so transfixing they were trying to figure out a protocol. OK So who gets them. Right if you’ve got to be in the position of rationing ventilators and then what do you do. Wait I’m sorry. Somebody just had a very interesting was a retired firefighter  you spoke to. Tell me about that. Oh  and that the firefighters aren’t going to get any PPE. That’s such an amazing point because they’re being called to all of these. See you’re right. And I think that a lot of people. I mean bus drivers are getting them. I mean  they should have more protection. They’re performing a valuable service. And they’re utterly exposed. It’s terrifying. Anyway  so there was this very moving kind of testimony from a bus driver that I’m sure you saw that went viral in Detroit who you know got sick anyway. And then subsequently passed away. So it’s true. There are shortages everywhere. It’s very complicated. We don’t have. And because Donald Trump has been very reluctant to make full  robust use of the Defense Production Act. We’re not getting it out to the people who really want it. I’m sorry to the people who really require it. We’re not making it at the speed that we need it. You know I mean  Trump could be much more bullish about insisting that private companies manufacture this stuff. And he’s not he’s not being insistent about them making ventilators. I mean  it’s. And you know not enough are making masks. It’s very  very complicated. And it’s not being distributed through kind of rational distribution trains. Anyway I’m going to go back to what I wrote about last week. All of our first responders are already putting themselves in harm’s way. They are already feeling they’re already getting sicker. But my next fear for them is that they’re going to have to make really tough rationing decisions. And these are decisions that state with you forever in the military. There is a term was coined actually by a psychiatrist who was looking at Vietnam soldiers and he called this moral injury. It is when you do something that you never ever would consider right. It violates your every impulse your every instinct your religious training your religious beliefs your everything. And I think that doctors and nurses when they are asked to form triage committees when they are asked to be disconnecting ventilators even from patients with whom they have made even the weakest most tenuous connections. But they’ve met their families they’ve interacted with their families. This is going to be heartbreaking stuff. And in ordinary circumstances. These are people who they could have saved because in normal times  you can keep people on ventilators in perpetuity. There are enough of them to go around. But that’s not what’s going on at this moment. And I think that the kind of trauma that comes from having to make this decision about who gets a ventilator and who doesn’t get a ventilator is going to live with all of us all of our mental health. I’m sorry. All of our health professionals for a long time to come. It’s the kind of choice that they shouldn’t ever have to make. It’s a devil’s kit of options. There’s no good options here. And so I think that I’m just very deeply moved by that. And I was going to read some of the comments that I got in response to that from people who just said some beautiful things about oh in fact  here. Let me just find. There is one who is married. Here we are. This was a beautiful comment I got in response to this years ago  I opened the door to a stockroom in the hospital. I worked in and I found a weeping nurse. Her patient’s bone marrow transplant had failed and the woman was going to die. Never underestimate how much these people care they may hide their tears in closets because they don’t want patients to see their fear and their distress  but most choose this work because lives matter. People’s lives matter to them. And they know death. But every preventable death is a knife to the heart. I mean  I can barely read that without wanting to cry. I mean  I think this is the point. Under ordinary circumstances. These are preventable deaths. Right and right now these men and women are facing a plague of what would have been preventable deaths and what awaits them. I fear our decisions about who gets to live. I mean  who on earth should have to make that choice. And there are all sorts of extremely delicate ethical questions that go that go into this ethical calculations. So here’s another beautiful sign a beautiful note that I got. I think my son needs to go. This is clarinets life with a zoom group. I’m going to read one more thing. And then I’m going to sign off because my son needs to use the computer. Here is just this is it. This gave me the chills but this was a response to something that I got in response to my Jennifer Senior from the New York Times. I’m the latest columnist to join. Thank you. And for those who are accusing me of it. It’s very interesting the dedicated army out there and people who want to see them spreading fake tears. I hope that’s right. I hope I’m wrong about everything. Let me just say that I hope everything I say today is 100% wrong. I hope the dad is wrong. I hope the doctors are wrong. I hope the epidemiologists are wrong. I hope every bit of health data I’ve been looking at is dead is wrong. That’s all I can say. From your mouth to God’s ears may I be wrong. May I be spreading falsehoods in saying that I think too many are going to die needlessly anyway. So here is the note that I got. I live alone. And I have a big sign posted on my door. Do not call an ambulance. No ventilator no code blue to not resuscitate. Just let me die. I have an advance directive. I am sorry. I have an advanced care directive a will and a notebook with instructions. My doctor is now six. So I don’t know who I will end up being my doctor anyway  if I am found and still alive. I want to make sure that I do not get into a situation of being trapped in a hospital alone and unable to make my wishes known. Let someone else who needs and wants a ventilator to have it. I’ve lived a long enough life. And I’m willing to let go. Of course  I’d rather not die right now. But if I get sick. I don’t want the medical care when other people want it and need it more  especially when the doctors and nurses would be putting their own lives at risk. I love this person. He just goes by initials s.f. to a happy day on our website. I want to leave it at that. Anyway thanks so much. Be safe stay home be responsible. My thanks to all of you who’ve been sending me these really beautiful notes of support that are what I’ll ever do about my hair. Here and I’m going to let my kid use the computer now tell everyone. It’s nice to meet. Let’s start with the basics. First: Narcissistic personalities like Trump harbor skyscraping delusions about their own capabilities. They exaggerate their accomplishments  focus obsessively on projecting power  and wish desperately to win. What that means  during this pandemic: Trump says we’ve got plenty of tests available  when we don’t. He declares that Google is building a comprehensive drive-thru testing website  when it isn’t. He sends a Navy hospital ship to New York and it proves little more than an excuse for a campaign commercial  arriving and sitting almost empty in the Hudson. A New York hospital executive calls it a joke. Second: The grandiosity of narcissistic personalities belies an extreme fragility  their egos as delicate as foam. They live in terror of being upstaged. They’re too thin skinned to be told they’re wrong. What that means  during this pandemic: Narcissistic leaders never have  as Trump likes to say  the best people. They have galleries of sycophants. With the exceptions of Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx  Trump has surrounded himself with a Z-team of dangerously inexperienced toadies and flunkies — the bargain-bin rejects from Filene’s Basement — at a time when we require the brightest and most imaginative minds in the country. Faced with a historic public health crisis  Trump could have assembled a first-rate company of disaster preparedness experts. Instead he gave the job to his son-in-law  a man-child of breathtaking vapidity. Faced with a historic economic crisis  Trump could have assembled a team of Nobel-prize winning economists or previous treasury secretaries. Instead he talks to Larry Kudlow  a former CNBC host. Meanwhile  Fauci and Birx measure every word they say like old-time apothecaries  hoping not to humiliate the narcissist — never humiliate a narcissist — while discreetly correcting his false hopes and falsehoods. They are desperately attempting to create a safe space for our president  when the president should be creating a safer nation for all of us. Third: Narcissistic personalities love nothing more than engineering conflict and sowing division. It destabilizes everyone  keeps them in control. What that means  during this pandemic: Trump is pitting state against state for precious resources  rather than coordinating a national response. (“It’s like being on eBay ” complained Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York last week.) His White House is a petty palace of competing power centers. He picks fights with Democratic officials and members of the press  when all the public craves is comfort. Narcissistic personalities don’t do comfort. They cannot fathom the needs of other hearts. Fourth: Narcissistic personalities are vindictive. On a clear day  you can see their grudges forever. What that means  during this pandemic: Trump is playing favorites with governors who praise him and punishing those who fail to give him the respect he believes he deserves. “If they don’t treat you right  don’t call ” he told Vice President Mike Pence. His grudge match with New York is now especially lethal. When asked on Friday whether New York will have enough ventilators  Trump bluntly answered “No ” and then blamed the state. And most relevant  as far as history is concerned: Narcissistic personalities are weak. What that means  during this pandemic: Trump is genuinely afraid to lead. He can’t bring himself to make robust use of the Defense Production Act  because the buck would stop with him. (To this day  he insists states should be acquiring their own ventilators.) When asked about delays in testing  he said  “I don’t take responsibility at all.” During Friday’s news conference  he added the tests “we inherited were “broken  were obsolete ” when this form of coronavirus didn’t even exist under his predecessor. This sounds an awful lot like one of the three sentences that Homer Simpson swears will get you through life: “It was like that when I got here.” Most people  even the most hotheaded and difficult ones  have enough space in their souls to set aside their anger in times of crisis. Think of Rudolph Giuliani during Sept. 11. Think of Andrew Cuomo now. But every aspect of Trump’s crisis management has been annexed by his psychopathology. As Americans die  he boasts about his television ratings. As Americans die  he crows that he’s No. 1 on Facebook  which isn’t close to true. But it is true that all eyes are on him. He’s got a captive audience  an attention-addict’s dream come to life. It’s just that he  like all narcissistic personalities  has no clue how disgracefully — how shamefully  how deplorably — he’ll be enshrined in memory.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/business/media/brothers-cuomo-andrew-chris.html, business media, Americans Don’t Trust the Media Anymore. So Why Do They Trust the Cuomos?, CNN once prevented Chris Cuomo from interviewing his brother on the air. But that all changed with the arrival of the coronavirus  and now it’s changing television  too., Supported by the media equation CNN once prevented Chris Cuomo from interviewing his brother on the air. But that all changed with the arrival of the coronavirus  and now it’s changing television  too. By Ben Smith At the end of 2013  CNN executives sent word to Chris Cuomo: No more interviewing your brother on television. The CNN host had taken a little heat when he addressed his older brother  Andrew Cuomo  deferentially as “governor” in an interview about a train accident in New York. Can you really cover your brother fairly? critics asked on Twitter. So for six years  Chris Cuomo sat by silently while the governor appeared on his morning show “New Day ” but was interviewed by other CNN personalities. The elder Mr. Cuomo used those occasions to mock his little brother so brutally that Jon Stewart made a montage of it. Andrew Cuomo at one point suggested that Chris Cuomo “go into a prison and maybe stay there for about a year or so and then do an exposé on prison life.” All that changed on Wednesday  March 11. Andrew Cuomo had become too central to the coronavirus story to ignore  and Chris Cuomo’s bosses at CNN gave him the green light. So in a series of four riveting interviews  Andrew Cuomo  62  delivered the scary reality of the pandemic to his brother’s audience. He also bragged that he is their mother’s favorite and that Chris — Christopher  he calls him — was the family “meatball.” When the governor’s audio finally dropped  Chris delivered an aside: “This is a great chance for me to say some things to him.” The Cuomo brothers’ show became a deeper drama last week when Chris Cuomo  49  revealed his coronavirus diagnosis. He had lost 13 pounds in three days. He chipped a tooth one night when he was in terrible pain. On Thursday  he called into his brother’s daily news conference. “You came to me in a dream  you had on a very interesting ballet outfit  and you were dancing in the dream  and you were waving a wand and saying  ‘I wish I could wave my wand and make this go away ’” Chris Cuomo told the governor. The sick guy in his basement roasting his brother is not exactly high-minded journalism. Imagine the reaction  if  say  a Trump family member interviewed the president on Fox News. But it is moving television. And more than anything  it reflects the instincts and inclinations of Jeff Zucker  the morning show producer-turned-corporate executive who now runs CNN. “It flies against every preconceived notion of normal CNN standards and practices ” Piers Morgan  the former CNN host who is now a co-presenter of “Good Morning Britain ” said in an interview. “But ” Mr. Morgan added  “the corona governor talking to his victim brother is incredible to watch.” Both Cuomos declined to speak about their on-screen relationship. But on his SiriusXM radio show last Tuesday  the younger Cuomo acknowledged that  when interviewing the governor  he’s not an ordinary journalist questioning a public official. He’s offering insight into a man he is close to and hopes his audience can understand more deeply. “I wanted people to see that he’s not just super-intense on this all the time — that he’s living it with you ” Chris Cuomo said. “He gets it. He’s not a general. He’s a man in full  and he’s worried.” He acknowledged the obvious conflict of interest. “There will come a time when there’s an accountability measure where it will no longer make sense for it to be me” interviewing the governor  he said. Even without the almost cinematic story line  the coronavirus moment seemed tailor-made for Chris Cuomo. He’s a high-wattage  emotional journeyman who arrived at CNN to revive its morning show in 2013. His unpredictable  in-your-face style — on camera and off — didn’t always work in an ensemble. So in 2018  Mr. Zucker moved him to a 9 p.m. slot  opposite MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity of Fox News  two ideologically driven powerhouses who typically — and easily — bested CNN in the ratings. For two years  Mr. Cuomo delivered a solid audience — it is CNN’s top-rated show — but never broke out. His mad-as-hell attacks on government failures lacked the explanatory clarity offered by Ms. Maddow and her MSNBC colleague Chris Hayes. His celebrity quality — taut T-shirts and bulging biceps bared during Hurricane Irma in 2017 and workout videos on Instagram — didn’t connect to the political moment. His most compelling viral moment occurred last year  when he erupted angrily at a guy who called him “Fredo” at a bar on Shelter Island. But the new crisis plays to his strengths. It is about Mr. Cuomo’s go-to topic: government failure. Audiences are eager for accountability and information. But they are also responding to love  Noah Oppenheim  the president of NBC News who keeps an eye on the competition  said in an interview. “Love between people — whether it’s brothers in high-profile positions  or doctors and patients.” That is one thing the Cuomos do: They love one another. On March 30  the day a Navy hospital ship arrived in New York  they said “I love you” twice each  in quick succession. The affection  the combat — this is  friends say  how they are. “I was a little shocked at how open they’re being about this but people seem to really enjoy it ” said a close friend of Chris Cuomo’s  Chris Vlasto  an ABC News executive producer. (I’ve noticed that I’m quoting a lot of men in this column; the Cuomos’ world is very male.) The boys and their three sisters grew up at the feet of Gov. Mario Cuomo  who served as a counterpoint in the 1980s to the Republican president  Ronald Reagan. Mario Cuomo was the intellectual keeper of the Democratic flame  much as his elder son provides Democrats with their clearest contrast to President Trump today. The governor was a demanding father who bred intense competitiveness among his children. Andrew was a gear head and his father’s right hand; Chris was the pudgy youngest of five  who worshiped his big brother. “The relationship between Andrew and Chris when they were younger was much more a father and son type relationship ” said John Marino  an aide to Mario Cuomo  who recalled driving to New Jersey with Andrew days before the 1986 New York election to check out a used sports car that Chris wanted. “Mario was governor  he was busy  and Andrew remained very  very close to Chris.” Their relationship has stayed close  and complex. Andrew is a solitary figure  Chris is an extrovert. Andrew is a behind-the-scenes player  Chris is a performer. Chris has also been an adviser to his brother  people who have worked for Andrew told me  sometimes extending his advice to the governor’s staff. He’s encouraged his brother’s boldness; he has also encouraged the governor’s prickliness about media coverage  a shared “Cuomo gene ” one friend said. And now  suddenly  “my brother is this fulcrum point of where we are  and what’s going on  and now all of you are watching CNN for perspective on this and I’m right in the middle of it ” Chris Cuomo said on his radio show. “And now I have coronavirus. So weird.” He added: “The fact that you think Andrew is sexy is so weird to me.” CNN’s audience more than doubled from March 9 to April 2  according to Nielsen  outpacing its rivals in audience growth. “Cuomo Prime Time” is up even more  118 percent. The most-read story on CNN’s website on Thursday — even as news broke that 6.6 million people had filed unemployment claims — was about Mr. Cuomo’s personal battle with the virus. It’s easy  in this strange moment  to forget how far even outside the stretched norms of television news this is. But the critics have started to raise eyebrows. The Washington Post’s media columnist  Margaret Sullivan  asked Saturday whether the “journalism ethics police” shouldn’t shut down the whole thing. Fabian Reinbold  a German foreign correspondent based in Washington  was also puzzled. “It would be considered highly inappropriate and corrupt back home  but here it is getting applause on Twitter by a lot of colleagues ” Mr. Reinbold said. “Needless to say  there are plenty of such problems in the Fox News/Trump corner as well  but this surprised much more.” Crises often transform the broadly accepted rules of media. And for a century they’ve pulled news toward emotion and connection. Edward R. Murrow opened a new kind of broadcast news theater when he spoke from a London roof in 1940  and made his audience feel the terror of the Blitz. On Sept. 11  2001  the business reporter Ron Insana  who witnessed the collapse of the World Trade Center  showed up on “The Today Show” his suit still dusty with ash. The coronavirus crisis has accelerated trends in American TV. There’s a technological shift; executives are already thinking about how much money they will save by sticking to Skype and Zoom (or  in CNN’s case  Cisco Webex  which struck perhaps the year’s luckiest marketing deal to put its logo on the screen of now-ubiquitous remote interviews). There’s the new experience of seeing reporters and anchors at home — which manages to feel both informal and staged at the same time. But the biggest shift may be the one Mr. Zucker and the Cuomos are now leading. They are  in their way  answering the endlessly debated question of how to restore trust in media. Do you strive to project an impossible ideal of total objectivity? Or do you reveal more of yourself  on Twitter or on Instagram and in your home? The old model for authority in public affairs  of course  is a man in a suit and a tie behind a desk. It was appropriated with particular success by Donald Trump on “The Apprentice ” another Zucker creation. Today  daily White House news briefings often feel like clumsily produced episodes of reality television  a kind of parody of old-fashioned TV seriousness. Meanwhile  Mr. Zucker’s CNN is taking TV news in the other direction  toward reality television and Instagram  winning trust through the projection of a rough-cut realness. The Cuomos aren’t just feeling your pain. You’re feeling theirs. News organizations invest heavily to build belief in their brands. That’s why CNN calls itself “The Most Trusted Name in News.” But at a moment when celebrities and social media figures seem to be connecting with Americans better than faceless brands  two brothers who share corny jokes and coronavirus fears are turning the “Cuomo” name into its own source of trust. “You get trust from authenticity and relatability and vulnerability ” Mr. Zucker told me. “That’s what the brothers Cuomo are giving us right now.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.

And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense.

Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/business/0405JPBENSMITH-print/0405JPBENSMITH-print-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
06/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/business/european-banks-coronavirus.html, business, European Banks Prepared for a Crisis. But Not This One., The financial impact of the coronavirus surpasses the old worst-case scenarios  threatening a credit crunch or even a new financial crisis., Supported by The financial impact of the coronavirus surpasses the old worst-case scenarios  threatening a credit crunch or even a new financial crisis. By Jack Ewing FRANKFURT — It was supposed to be a drill. Government overseers would test whether European banks could survive a hypothetical perfect storm that included a steep economic downturn  plunging stock prices and a collapse in consumer spending. But before bank regulators could begin their planned stress test this year  they were confronted with the real thing. The financial impact of the coronavirus — visible in shuttered factories  empty airports and desolate downtowns — makes their worst-case scenario  a 4.3 decline in European Union economic output by the end of 2022  seem mild by comparison. Some economists expect the European economy to decline by more than 10 percent in the first half of this year because of the pandemic  threatening an explosion of bad loans  deteriorating assets and plummeting share prices. The question that regulators and central bankers are asking themselves now is whether the measures they took in recent years to crisis-proof the banking system will be enough to prevent a credit crunch  bank failures and a financial meltdown with global ramifications. Andrea Enria  who oversees bank regulation at the European Central Bank  said that the damage has been manageable so far. But  he said from his home office in Frankfurt  “We still have to understand how long this will last and how deep it will become.” Banks are under pressure anywhere on the planet that the virus has spread  which is virtually everywhere. The problem is particularly acute in Europe because many banks there never really recovered from the last financial crisis  which began in 2008 with toxic real estate debt  spread to eurozone government debt and took at least seven years to tame. Lenders like Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt are plagued by meager profitability  inefficient operations and the continuing cost of cleaning up old messes. More than the United States  the European economy depends on banks to function. European companies get more than two-thirds of their credit in the form of bank loans  while American firms get less than one third directly from banks. They raise the rest by selling corporate bonds or shares. There is no sign yet of bank failures  in part because the European Central Bank quickly flooded the financial system with cash. “There may be some smaller banks that have to be bailed out  but I don’t think any of the big ones ” said Richard Portes  professor of economics at London Business School. But Mr. Portes  who is also chairman of a committee that advises the European Central Bank and European regulators on financial risk  cautioned that things are happening so fast it’s impossible to say what the future may bring. “In a worst-case scenario  it could trigger another financial crisis ” Marcel Fratzscher  president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin  told reporters on Thursday. “The banking system in Europe and in Germany is not as robust and resilient as one would wish.” When it’s all over  European banks could be even more diminished on the global stage than they already are. After the 2008 financial crisis  American giants like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs bounced back more quickly than their European rivals and pushed them to the sidelines. Deutsche Bank is the last eurozone lender among the top 10 investment banks globally  based on revenue. (Outside the European Union  Barclays in Britain and Credit Suisse in Switzerland also belong to the top 10.) As European citizens retreat indoors  and restaurants  hair salons and airport lobbies stand empty  the sudden halt of economic activity will expose banks’ hidden weaknesses. Regulators are worried  for example  about how much banks are vulnerable to debt rated just above junk. If  as expected  the crisis leads to widespread downgrades of this debt by rating agencies  investment funds run by banks would be forced to dump the assets at fire sale prices because they are not allowed to own junk bonds. Banks are also struggling to serve big corporate customers like airlines or carmakers that are suddenly drawing down existing lines of credit to compensate for plunging sales. Lenders are required to devote a certain amount of capital to every loan they make. The sudden demand for credit eats away at their reserves. “Losses from big corporate borrowers are the big concern at the moment ” said Nicolas Véron  a senior fellow at Bruegel  a research organization in Brussels. Banks that have lent heavily to the aviation industry  like Natixis in France  or to the oil and gas industry  like ING in the Netherlands  could be particularly exposed  according to analysts at Berenberg Bank. A spokesman for ING said that only about 4 billion euros  or $4.3 billion  of the 38 billion euros the bank has lent to oil and gas companies is at risk because of recent declines in energy prices. Natixis declined to comment. The crisis has been especially harsh for Italian banks. Italy has the highest death toll from the virus in Europe  and its economy was already on the verge of recession. Germany and other northern European countries have balked at proposals to share the financial burden of the crisis. That could fuel political resentment in Italy if any of its banks need government bailouts. The country’s debt is already dangerously high. “If you want to have this crisis followed by populist governments  right-wing governments ” Mr. Portes said  “that’s one way of getting it.” German banks are also weak  even though the country’s economy is much healthier. The country has more banks than it needs  and many are barely profitable. In late March  the ratings agency Fitch revised its assessments of numerous German lenders downward  including the two biggest  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Banks also face a threat that no one thought of before. Call it the work-from-home risk. With so many traders  loan officers and technology specialists working remotely  there is greater danger of data breaches or cyberattacks. There are some grounds for optimism. Major policymakers like Christine Lagarde  the president of the European Central Bank  are veterans of the debt crisis that began in 2010 and nearly destroyed the eurozone. Philip Lane  the central bank’s chief economist  was previously governor of the Central Bank of Ireland  and witnessed firsthand the meltdown of Irish banks that followed the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. With those bitter experiences in mind  European leaders moved quickly to head off a financial crisis that would multiply the economic damage caused by shutdowns and quarantines. The European Central Bank will buy up to 1 trillion euros  or $1.1 trillion  of government and corporate bonds  which helps hold down interest rates and makes it easier for banks to extend loans. The central bank’s regulatory arm has allowed banks to deploy capital they had set aside for just such an emergency. Countries including Italy and Germany are providing credit guarantees so that struggling businesses can still get loans. Mr. Enria  the top regulator  has eased some of the regulatory requirements on banks. The stress test scheduled to be completed by the end of July  a major administrative burden for banks  was postponed. In return  Mr. Enria insisted that banks put a hold on dividends and cap bonuses to managers. “At this moment the key point is to preserve capital ” Mr. Enria said. The European financial system is stronger than it was during the last crisis. Political leaders centralized oversight of lenders at the European Central Bank. That has helped prevent the bickering and political jockeying among national bank supervisors that hampered crisis management in the past. New rules forced banks to reduce their reliance on borrowed money and build up their capital reserves. Now  Mr. Enria said  “they have quite a lot of resources to burn before they hit the wire.” But the longer the crisis lasts  the greater the risk that those resources will run low. “We can hold out at least for some time ” said Wim Mijs  chief executive of the European Banking Federation  an industry group. “If you bring the whole economy to a stop for six months  well  then we will have to see.” Melissa Eddy in Berlin contributed reporting.

Then the coronavirus pandemic led to closed casinos and the cancellation of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments., Supported by Sports betting was poised for a big moment. Then the coronavirus pandemic led to closed casinos and the cancellation of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments. By Alan Blinder and Kevin Draper COUNCIL BLUFFS  Iowa — The Horseshoe Council Bluffs Casino had planned an advertising campaign  looking to beckon visiting college basketball fans to its sports book. A rival  Ameristar  spent about $750 000 to renovate a space for sports enthusiasts it hoped would crowd into its property along the Missouri River and bet on March Madness  the Masters golf tournament and many offerings in between. This spring was supposed to be a showcase for Iowa’s nearly eight-month-old experiment with sports betting. The coronavirus pandemic  though  shuttered nearly every casino in the United States and prompted the N.C.A.A. to cancel its hallmark men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. The three-week bonanza — 130 games across both tournaments  attracting casual fans with office pools and buzzer-beaters — would have ended Monday night with the men’s championship game. But gambling companies missed out on the surge in visitors and wagers they were counting on. “March Madness is sort of the epitome of sports betting ” said Yaniv Sherman  the top U.S. executive at 888 Holdings  which offers sports betting in three states  though not Iowa. “It is a unique combination of a large number of unpredictable events in a short time frame.” Casinos have been decimated in the economic reckoning brought on by the outbreak. According to the American Gaming Association  a trade group  987 of the country’s 989 casinos were closed by early April  as efforts to stop the virus from spreading picked up. The stock prices for many gaming companies are down 60 percent or more  reflecting investor pessimism about their futures. Not long after strapped state governments looked to sports gambling as a new source of revenue  betting operators and casinos that are normally eager to grow are suddenly straining just to keep the lights on at the properties they already have. All told  the shutdown of sports and so much of leisure spending has been a striking turnabout for an industry less than two years removed from the Supreme Court decision that cleared a path for sports wagers across the country and  gambling executives hoped  a new generation of bettors. This year  they felt  had particular promise. More sports books were open  California could vote as soon as November on whether to allow horse tracks and tribal casinos to offer sports betting  and even before the specter of a recession loomed  even more states were considering allowing wagers on games and players. Even the N.C.A.A.  which had long opposed the sports betting it then litigated all the way to the Supreme Court  had begrudgingly accepted that the wagers would be a part of American life in one form or another. A dozen games in this year’s men’s tournament were to be played within 25 miles of a brick-and-mortar sports book; last season  not one of the spectacle’s 67 games was so near legal sports betting. The N.C.A.A.  whose offices in Indianapolis now stand about a mile from a sports book  had already rescinded a policy that banned championship competitions from states that allowed wagers on single games. The evolving landscape — Iowa decided last year to legalize sports betting  beginning in August — had positioned Council Bluffs and its casinos to reap something of a windfall from March Madness despite not hosting any games. That was because Omaha  not even a 10-minute drive away  was poised to have six games. To place a legal bet on college basketball  all a fan would have to do was cross the Missouri. “While there’s been a separation of church and state  so to speak  it’s the first time we’re getting it blended ” Samir Mowad  the general manager of two Caesars Entertainment properties in Council Bluffs  said in February. Trends in other casino markets clearly suggested that the tournament and its matchups in Omaha were a chance for the Council Bluffs casinos to draw people who might have otherwise stayed in Nebraska  and to appeal to younger people who often avoid table games and slot machines. Although sports betting only made up 3 percent of gambling revenue in Nevada last year  it was an important driver of visits to casinos in the first place  prompting people to spend money on hotel rooms  meals and entertainment. And while the heaviest betting in Nevada was on football in 2019  the most bet on a single sport in a single month was on basketball in March  driven largely by college basketball. In Iowa  where sports bettors have wagered at least $327 million since August  casino executives declined to discuss their forecasts for tournament-related wagers except to say that they had anticipated millions of dollars in bets would course through the Council Bluffs properties alone. In Nebraska  which has had a lottery since 1993  hospitality executives and critics of sports betting had accepted that the state would cede some hoops-related dollars to Iowa. But some of them were still hesitant about bringing gambling across the Missouri River. “It’s certainly very attractive to state legislatures to say  ‘We can tax this and we can get some money ’ but sometimes they don’t always count the bankruptcies and the social costs of gambling ” said Tom Osborne  the Republican former congressman who led Nebraska’s football team for 25 seasons and who has long opposed gambling in his home state. Osborne also suggested that sports betting would undercut the culture of college athletics. “It really detracts from the overall appreciation of the game  for the game itself ” he said. Now  there are no games to appreciate at all. Along with losing the tournament  Omaha also lost the College World Series  which the city was again poised to host this year. A spokeswoman declined to make Mowad available for an interview in the wake of the N.C.A.A.’s decision and the shutdowns of casinos. In a statement on its website  Caesars said it would “work with local officials to establish a reopening date as soon as it is appropriate to do so.” And the N.C.A.A.  which has long resisted gambling and continues to bar many people connected to college athletics from sports wagering  will have to wait another year to see how an expansion of betting will affect its signature event. N.C.A.A. officials expected many states to pursue legalized sports gambling after the Supreme Court’s ruling  but some officials were surprised by the speed with which governments approved new laws and regulations. Fourteen states allow some form of sports betting  while another six are setting it up  according to Legal Sports Report. The pressure on states to collect more taxes by expanding sports betting or loosening regulations for online betting and casinos may intensify as the pandemic leads to more economic pain. But sports betting operators first have to last long enough. “We regret the dire choices we have had to make ” the chief executive of MGM Resorts International wrote in a March email announcing that all MGM properties nationwide had been closed. Casino operators have joined numerous other industries in asking for federal aid for their beleaguered operations. “I don’t think that any form of gaming is uniquely isolated from the pressure of economic hardship ” said Chris Grove  an analyst at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. Belarusian soccer provides a few of the last games to bet on  and some operators have gotten permission to offer odds on e-sports and other less common competitions. Sherman  the executive at 888 Holdings  laughed when asked if action-starved bettors would flock to new wagers. Betting in some obscure sports was up 1 000 percent  he said  “but the base they started from is negligible. They do not make up for the slack.” As painful as losing March Madness is for the sports betting industry  it is not the apocalypse scenario. That scenario  of course  is if football — America’s most popular sport and by far its most popular to bet on — doesn’t resume in the fall as scheduled. “The industry right now  as much as anyone is willing to commit to a plan  is acting as if the world is one where the N.F.L. continues ” Grove said.

Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.

05/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/sports/autoracing/coronavirus-nascar-racing-earnhardt.html, sports autoracing, The Best Thing About NASCAR’s Virtual Races Might Be the Real Competition, The sport’s drivers compete from home  the announcers call it like a real race  Fox Sports broadcasts it on TV and nobody gets hurt., Supported by The sport’s drivers compete from home  the announcers call it like a real race  Fox Sports broadcasts it on TV and nobody gets hurt. By Jeff Arnold When Denny Hamlin’s No. 11 Toyota sped across the finish line at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida last month  the victory was unlike any he had experienced. Trailing Dale Earnhardt Jr. on the race’s final lap  Hamlin  the 2006 NASCAR Cup Series rookie of the year  made a final push coming out of Turn 4 and surged past Earnhardt to win a race he had led for only 14 of the 150 laps. Why so unusual? He was driving barefoot  for one  and was competing from a race simulator at his home outside Charlotte  N.C. For Hamlin  who has 38 Cup victories  including wins at the Daytona 500 in 2016  2019 and 2020  his triumph at the virtual Homestead track on March 22 came in the inaugural race of the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series  an event created as a diversion for racing fans during the coronavirus pandemic. NASCAR postponed its real-life race in Atlanta on March 13  two days before its start. Then on March 16  all races through May 3 were postponed. As drivers contemplated a long layoff  Tim Clark  NASCAR’s chief digital officer  started to brainstorm. He realized that his organization’s partnership with iRacing  a motor sports racing simulation software company  might be a solution. Thus was born the eNASCAR series  a virtual racing experience involving the sport’s biggest names. It has been broadcast over the past three weekends on Fox Sports  attracting 903 000 viewers in its first week and 1.3 million in its second  according to Nielsen. Sunday’s race  which took place at a virtual version of Tennessee’s Bristol Motor Speedway  included 11 caution flags before William Byron crossed the finish line first  delivering a win for Hendrick Motorsports. The actress Rita Wilson  who along with her husband  the actor Tom Hanks  had been quarantined because of the virus  sang the national anthem. Clark said he did not anticipate that the series  or the broadcasts  which include in-race interviews with drivers  would be so popular. “With the way it is happening right now in the world  I think everyone is looking for a distraction and is looking for some entertainment ” Clark said. That feeling has carried over to the drivers. Unlike on actual race weekends  when certain cars are faster than others  these drivers operate on a technologically level playing field. Everyone is tied to the same iRacing software  so it is left to the individual to be the fastest driver in the field. That hasn’t stopped drivers from tinkering. Timmy Hill used a $300 steering wheel to win on March 29 at virtual Texas Motor Speedway  and Hamlin said he spent about $40 000 on his race simulator in 2016. Hamlin’s setup includes a hydraulic system that tilts the simulator from side to side as he navigates the virtual tracks’ banked curves  putting him in a familiar position. “It’s as close as you can possibly get ” Hamlin said in a telephone interview last week  “without the actual motion and the G-forces. Everything else is the same.” He added: “With iRacing  you’re using the exact same skill sets. It’s exactly the same. It’s the inputs from your brain to your feet to your hands. Everything is the same.” When Steve Myers  an executive vice president at iRacing  and his colleagues developed the programming for race simulation in 2004 that is now available to the public for about $7 a month  they realized authenticity was critical. Since then  iRacing has gone to great lengths to recreate every aspect of the experience — from the feel of the tires as the rubber begins to wear down to how drivers react to the bumps on different tracks. While N.F.L. players who dabble in Madden video games aren’t really playing football and N.B.A. players who compete at N.B.A. 2K aren’t really playing basketball  iRacing puts physical driving skills to the test. On television broadcasts  Myers said  viewers are given the perspective of how difficult it is to compete — Hamlin says there are about a dozen drivers who are in a position to finish first on any given weekend. The televised series has proved to be a hit with drivers who are competing for nothing more than bragging rights  unlike the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series  which is played by gamers and offers a $300 000 prize pool  $100 000 to the top finisher. Clark  the NASCAR executive  is among those who have become captivated by the simulated races  which include everything an actual race would  including high-speed collisions. “There have been times I have watched the broadcast  and you certainly would have to pay very close attention to tell whether or not you’re watching a real race broadcast ” he said  adding that the participation of the sport’s premier drivers increases the appeal to fans. Hamlin  who finished fourth in Sunday’s race  said that the crashes were actually the least realistic part of the broadcast  but that the software developers were working on them. Drivers are not compensated  unless you count ego boosts. But Hamlin knows that if the televised races can draw first-time fans — Nielsen reported that 225 000 viewers said they had never watched a NASCAR event before tuning in to his Week 1 victory — the experiment will be a success. The key  he said  is keeping drivers engaged as they promote their sport to a passionate fan base that will tune in no matter what they are racing. For Hamlin  who never had time for video games because he tinkered with go-karts as a child  the virtual reality is one he is willing to live with — at least for now  at least in this strange  sad  challenging time. “It’s something I’ve never seen and hopefully will never see again ” he said  “but we’re trying to make the most of it right now.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.

By Tom Mashberg For all its stated good intentions  when the Museum of the Bible in Washington was first envisioned a decade ago  skeptics worried it would favor religious proselytizing over neutral scholarship and buttoned-down collecting practices. Part of that caution grew from the fact that the museum’s guiding spirit was 78-year-old David Green  an evangelical Christian who founded the multi-billion-dollar Hobby Lobby chain in 1972 and who had written of the Bible: “This isn’t just some book that someone made up. It’s God  it’s history  and we want to show that.” So it was far from good news for the museum last month when it disclosed  just days apart  that thousands of its Middle Eastern antiquities had tainted provenances and that its vaunted collection of Dead Sea Scrolls was fake. But in a dozen interviews in recent days  some of the institution’s toughest critics said the transparency with which the museum has handled the disclosures was a positive step toward converting those who had questioned its methods and principles. “The museum did come clean here ” said Christopher A. Rollston  an associate professor of Near Eastern languages and civilizations at George Washington University who reviewed the findings about the scrolls. “But the museum will need to continue to engage in this sort of openness if they are to demonstrate that they are fair brokers of the public trust.” The Museum of the Bible’s mission statement says its goal is to give visitors “an immersive and personalized experience with the Bible and its ongoing impact on the world around us.” To that end  David Green and his son  Steve  56  have dedicated more than a decade and an estimated $50 million to amassing an eclectic assemblage of 50 000 artifacts related to the Old and New Testaments. As newcomers to the museum and antiquities fields  the Greens’ initial efforts at building a lavish and theologically significant repository gave some experts pause. Gary Vikan  a longtime museum director and provenance expert  spoke to the Green family and their initial museum staff in 2013 and said he saw trouble coming. “Broadly speaking  the Green folks had too much money and too little experience ” he said. “They seemed like evangelical history-of-religion types from an academic parallel universe that I had never before encountered.” Many of the objects they collected were printed bibles  biblical artifacts  illuminated manuscripts  artworks and ephemera  most of which date from the 1500s to the present. Exhibits today include Elvis Presley’s bible and letters on theology signed by Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther. They are now housed in a $450 million  eight-story  430 000-square-foot building  a soaring  ark-like structure that features 14-foot-tall bronze panels inscribed with Hebrew verses from the Book of Genesis and a “biblical roof garden” with expansive views of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall. But most of the museum’s older items  those that stretched back to ancient times  quickly led to problems. They included 4 000-year-old cuneiform tablets  slivers of papyrus  cylinder seals and clay bullae — all relics from ancient Mesopotamia that showcased some of the earliest forms of written communication. One of the items was inscribed in Sumerian with passages from the Epic of Gilgamesh  one of mankind’s earliest sagas of gods  floods  beasts and prophecies. In July 2017  just four months before the museum was set to open  federal prosecutors in New York announced that Hobby Lobby and the Greens had acquired  in 2010  at least 5 500 artifacts “fraught with red flags” from a dubious dealer in the United Arab Emirates. They had also allowed the objects to be shipped to the company’s headquarters in Oklahoma City “misleadingly described as ceramic tile samples ” according to prosecutors. Hobby Lobby relinquished those items and paid a $3 million fine. In a statement  Steve Green  who is president of Hobby Lobby and chairman of the Bible Museum  said: “The company was new to the world of acquiring these items and did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process. This resulted in some regrettable mistakes.” When the museum later opened on Nov. 17  2017  the Greens seemed confident their troubles were behind them. Steve Green spoke of the museum as “nonsectarian” and said of the Bible  “Let it have an impact in your life as it has my life or our family’s life and so many people all over the world.” “We don’t have any concerns about our collection ” Steven Bickley  the museum’s vice president of marketing  told The Atlantic just before the museum opened. Indeed  a year earlier  in 2016  the museum had even put out a scholarly ebook  now discredited  that touted the so-called Dead Sea scroll fragments as “an especially important addition to known material.” Since then  the museum has been a hit with visitors  and attendance last year reached one million despite an adult admission fee of $20 to $25. (It is closed during the coronavirus outbreak.) But the legacy of its original collecting practices remained and became the focus of an inquiry by a team of investigators hired by the museum to analyze its 16 scroll fragments. The scrolls were seen as a centerpiece of the museum’s permanent exhibition  so enlisting a team of scientists and conservators  assembled by Colette Loll  the founder of Art Fraud Insights  was an effort to demonstrate the museum’s good faith and its adherence to reputable scholarship. Hired under the proviso that it could act with full independence and present its findings free of interference  the team published its results on March 13. It found  as first reported by National Geographic  that not only were the fragments fake  they were “deliberate forgeries created in the 20th century.” Two weeks later  Steve Green announced another embarrassing gaffe. The museum  as first reported by The Wall Street Journal  would be sending another 11 500 artifacts — 5 000 papyri fragments and 6 500 clay objects — back to Iraq and Egypt because of “insufficient provenance.” In a long statement  Mr. Green admitted that he had “trusted the wrong people to guide me  and unwittingly dealt with unscrupulous dealers” when buying the items. “These early mistakes resulted in Museum of the Bible receiving a great deal of criticism over the years ” he added. “The criticism resulting from my mistakes was justified.” Of the scroll fragments  Ms. Loll said they struck her team as dubious from the moment they got them under a 3-D microscope. “We concluded that the forgers had added lines of ‘scripture’ to scraps of archaeological leather rather than to parchment ” she said. “In a nutshell  ‘old leather  new ink.’” But Ms. Loll is among several experts who say the Bible Museum’s failings are as much a learning opportunity as they are a sign that irresponsibility persists in the antiquities trade. “I have been incredibly impressed with the museum staff ” she said. “They understand and accept that transparency  although painful in the short term  is necessary for establishing credibility in the long term.” Jeffrey Kloha  the museum’s chief curatorial officer since 2017  has been leading efforts to purge the museum of tainted objects and put it on a credible footing. “In the early days of collecting ” said Mr. Kloha  who hired Ms. Loll’s team  “there really were not qualified individuals involved  and in some ways we knew these results were coming two-and-a-half years ago  because the documentation was  well  I’ll just say it was meager.” Experts who often disagree on the rules  ethics and impact of antiquities collecting were united in their irritation and dismay over the museum’s lax practices  but also saw an opportunity for the Green family to take the lead in setting a higher bar for acquisition standards. “Mr. Green is doing the right thing by repatriating these thousands of artifacts  but this gesture must be the start of the story  not the end ” said Tess Davis  executive director of the Antiquities Coalition  which argues for strict regulation of the trade. “The global black market for Middle Eastern antiquities is increasingly driven by biblical scholars  seminaries and the faithful seeking to own a piece of the Holy Land. Given Mr. Green’s platform and other resources  he is in an unparalleled position to stop this demand.” Kate Fitz Gibbon of the Committee for Cultural Property  which represents the interests of dealers  collectors and museums engaged in the lawful sale and collection of archaeological objects  said Mr. Green “failed to do the due diligence that has become routine for American art dealers and collectors and bought in the Middle East instead.” “While it’s currently an embarrassment to the museum ” she added  “the Museum of the Bible should be commended for researching the flaws in its collections and returning objects that should never have been bought in the first place.” Mr. Kloha  the chief curator  said he hoped the recent experiences would help the museum build confidence in its efforts. He plans to create an exhibit showcasing how Ms. Loll and her team used hard science to debunk the scroll fragments. “All we can do is operate in the most responsible and ethical way going forward ” he said  “and help the public understand how these things can happen.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/arts/05BIBLEMUSEUM1/merlin_171260931_a52b3806-a2ad-454d-ba49-f8ddbf638a20-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Bob Morris The first Saturday in March now seems like a decade ago. New Yorkers were not yet sheltering at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus  and on that night Franca Vercelloni was more immediately concerned with taming the noisy crowd at Marie’s Crisis  the storied Greenwich Village piano bar known for show-tune singalongs. “Either you be quiet and listen when we sing ” she said from behind her piano  “or I’m going to turn this car around and we’re not going to Disneyland.” As usual  it worked. After all  Vercelloni — who was playing at Marie’s Crisis when Liza Minnelli made a surprise appearance over a dozen years ago and was annoyed when  more recently  Jimmy Fallon threw himself on top of her piano as if it were a chaise longue — sees herself as “the dominatrix” of piano bar musicians. She finished her shift with “Let the Sunshine In” from “Hair ” greeted fans and went upstairs to an office. Wearing latex gloves  she counted her tips  spraying them with a lavender scent. “Sorry ” Vercelloni  42  said as she sorted the money  “but this is freaking me out.” Ten days later  after New York City’s bars were ordered to close in response to the worsening pandemic  she set up a camera in her one-bedroom apartment in Astoria  Queens  and started another kind of shift: live streams on Instagram and the Marie’s Crisis Facebook group page  where the bar’s singalongs have continued to bring people together during this moment of social distancing. She banged out “The Age of Aquarius” (also from “Hair”) and greeted regulars as their comments and requests scrolled on her phone screen  while flipping virtual sheet music pages on her iPad. At one point she tried  unsuccessfully  to sing two parts at once. “It’s all OK ” she said  “because the thing about Marie’s is that it’s organized chaos  just like the government.” Thomas Paine  who died in 1809 on the site where Marie’s Crisis now stands  wrote  “These are the times that try men’s souls” — words that certainly resonate today. And he’s central to the history of this little bar  which takes its name from his “The American Crisis” — and either the early 20th-century neighborhood restaurateur Romany Marie or Marie Dumont  the chanteuse who is said to have christened it. For decades  the bar was a haven for gay men. It was featured in “The Politician ” “High Maintenance” and “Younger ” and is probably the inspiration for a scene in the play “Some Men ” by Terrence McNally  whose recent death was caused by the virus now trying men’s souls. Vercelloni  who is classically trained  walked into Marie’s Crisis 14 years ago and within a week had two shifts. She was the bar’s only female pianist  and at the time the older gay clientele had a penchant for songs by Sondheim  and Comden and Green. (These days  it’s more Disney  “Wicked” and “Dear Evan Hansen.”) With the can-do spirit of Maria von Trapp and the don’t-do spirit of the Mother Abbess  she took to the extreme challenges of wrangling and controlling singalongs. “It’s also like being a psychic and a D.J. who has to read the room ” said Vercelloni  who is still the bar’s only female pianist and likes to say “Good job everybody  good job” after a song as if talking to a room of kindergarten children. “And sometimes it’s like being an improv comedian where you take suggestions and work with them.” She believes that communal singing lets people feel emotions they can’t access alone. The gush of comments on her live streams (and generous tips that have continued online) tell her that people need the outlet  camaraderie and opportunity to call upon the memories and aspirations that musicals bring up. She has also learned that if you boss them around — shutting them up without an apology or refusing to play until they behave — it will make them want to perform better. Vercelloni once told her audience that Marie’s Crisis was “like Catholic school  only angrier.” Indeed  the discipline she witnessed as a Catholic school student in upstate New York may have taught her about controlling a rowdy room  but not as much as her acting career or role as a no-nonsense student music director for high school shows. Her job now often surprises her by bringing out impulses she didn’t know she had. “I love to play  get people engaged and tell them what to do ” Vercelloni said. Randy Taylor  a former actor who is now a bartender and manager at Marie’s Crisis  said he admires Vercelloni’s many talents  chief among them her ability to sight-read anything — and pretty much anyone. “If you don’t collaborate here  it’s a problem ” Taylor said  adding that he instructs doormen to tell new customers that Marie’s Crisis is a place for show tunes and communal singing only. “So  if you want to sing anything cool ” one doorman likes to say  “go somewhere else.” In this rarefied community  in which arcane musical theater knowledge is a point of pride and each pianist has a distinct personality and repertoire  Vercelloni plays the role of a snarky but caring aunt. On a recent virtual singalong  she was saying hello to all the commenters on her screen and chattering away as if with family. “I can’t stop talking because I miss people ” she said. David Devoe  a musician and fan who became a friend  described her as “empathic  emotional and adaptive enough to turn on a dime ” adding: “She remembers faces  and is gracious  takes nothing for granted and will never let a rough moment or a rough night dissuade her from unifying a room.” One rough moment came for Ms. Vercelloni during a live stream last week. It wasn’t that she was having trouble with her PayPal link for tips  or that her upstairs neighbors were pounding ominously during “Everything’s Coming Up Roses.” Nor was it the challenge of reading a room when it was just names and comments in a constant scroll of adulation and uppercase requests that read like demands. It was a text message that came about 10 minutes before the end of her shift. Marc Castelli  her singing waiter colleague  who had a heart ailment  had died in his apartment the day before from complications of the coronavirus  and she had been waiting to hear whether the family wanted her to announce it. While singing “Magic to Do” from “Pippin ” she saw the message and thought about what to say. Inside  she was falling apart  realizing that Castelli’s family and friends wouldn’t be able to gather to memorialize him. But on camera  Vercelloni made the announcement simply  with what grace she could muster. Then  without missing a beat or letting herself cry  she played “Seasons of Love” from “Rent.” “I knew ” Vercelloni said later  “that’s what everyone needed at that moment.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/arts/01virtual-pianobar-1/01virtual-pianobar-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

So they called a different play., Supported by Times Insider A cascade of postponements and cancellations upended the coverage that Times editors and reporters had planned. So they called a different play. By Emma Grillo Times Insider explains who we are and what we do  and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. Victor Mather  a Sports reporter and editor at The New York Times  has a new column with an unusual name. Where once he might have reported on an emergency goalie in the N.H.L. or analyzed what went wrong in a Daytona 500 crash  the new column  “The Day in (No) Sports ” brings readers stories about announcers taking their commentary home and athletes incorporating their children into their workouts. Stories that “wouldn’t have been newsworthy before suddenly became interesting ” said Mr. Mather  who begins work at 7 each morning on the column  which he writes along with Danielle Allentuck  the Sports desk’s reporting fellow. His shift in outlook is one that the entire desk has had to make since the coronavirus pandemic forced organized sports around the world to postpone or suspend competition. The cancellations threw much of the coverage planned for the next few months — articles about baseball spring training  the run-up to the Olympics  the N.B.A. playoffs — up in the air. “There’s no playbook for how you cover sports when sports are not being played ” said Randal Archibold  the Sports editor for The Times. The play  though  turned out to be simple: Report the news and write about things that can be welcome diversions from the news — which  in a way  is what Sports has always done. Some articles detail lost seasons  but others reveal ways in which people found new ways to play — or contribute. Talya Minsberg  an assistant Sports editor  wrote about people across the United States turning to jogging as a way to safely exercise while practicing social distancing. And David Waldstein  a reporter  wrote about M.L.B. uniform material being used to produce protective masks and gowns. The desk has also been publishing features on sports that typically are not as frequently covered by The Times  like a report from Mr. Waldstein on cheating in chess. Mr. Archibold said many readers were looking for “counterprogramming ” stories that offer a break from coronavirus coverage. “You don’t want to be flip in any way ” he said  “but you also do want to acknowledge that readers  to some degree  want other things to read.” Sports reporters and editors have also helped with coronavirus coverage on the National  Metro and International desks. They’ve written about coronavirus disbelievers  edited articles about overloaded hospitals in Italy and contributed to The Times’s 24/7 live updates on the pandemic. Benjamin Hoffman  a senior Sports editor  said that covering the coronavirus hadn’t been as difficult as one might expect because sports coverage prepares reporters and editors to respond immediately to drastic change. “If you’ve written up an N.B.A. finals game  with new posts every 15 minutes for the entirety of the game  it’s not too big of a stretch to then move on to other live coverage ” he said. In fact  Mr. Hoffman helped manage a live blog that for weeks recorded how the coronavirus was affecting day-to-day life in the United States well beyond the sports world. For reporters who cover sports that have been postponed or canceled  like Sopan Deb  a basketball reporter  the altered landscape requires finding different ways to write about their beats. “We’re no longer talking about what’s going on on the floor  we’re talking about what’s going on off the floor ” Mr. Deb said. Along with working on articles about athletes testing positive for the coronavirus  he has written about the financial hit the N.B.A. will take from its suspension  and the impact on arena employees and other workers. “I have always seen sports as essential to society and culture; it intersects so much with everything ” Mr. Archibold  the Sports editor  said. “I think that it’s important to chronicle and document  as we do  the many ways that this virus is impacting life.” Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/insider/02-insider-sports/02-insider-sports-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Since then  nearly 40 000 Americans and other authorized travelers have made the trip  some this past week and many with spotty screening., Supported by There were 1 300 direct flights to 17 cities before President Trump’s travel restrictions. Since then  nearly 40 000 Americans and other authorized travelers have made the trip  some this past week and many with spotty screening. By Steve Eder  Henry Fountain  Michael H. Keller  Muyi Xiao and Alexandra Stevenson Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international health officials on New Year’s Eve  at least 430 000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China  including nearly 40 000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel  according to an analysis of data collected in both countries. The bulk of the passengers  who were of multiple nationalities  arrived in January  at airports in Los Angeles  San Francisco  New York  Chicago  Seattle  Newark and Detroit. Thousands of them flew directly from Wuhan  the center of the coronavirus outbreak  as American public health officials were only beginning to assess the risks to the United States. Flights continued this past week  the data show  with passengers traveling from Beijing to Los Angeles  San Francisco and New York  under rules that exempt Americans and some others from the clampdown that took effect on Feb. 2. In all  279 flights from China have arrived in the United States since then  and screening procedures have been uneven  interviews show. Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his travel measures impeded the virus’s spread in the United States. “I do think we were very early  but I also think that we were very smart  because we stopped China ” he said at a briefing on Tuesday  adding  “That was probably the biggest decision we made so far.” Last month  he said  “We’re the ones that kept China out of here.” But the analysis of the flight and other data by The New York Times shows the travel measures  however effective  may have come too late to have “kept China out ” particularly in light of recent statements from health officials that as many as 25 percent of people infected with the virus may never show symptoms. Many infectious-disease experts suspect that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks after the first American case was confirmed  in Washington State  on Jan. 20  and that it had continued to be introduced. In fact  no one knows when the virus first arrived in the United States. During the first half of January  when Chinese officials were underplaying the severity of the outbreak  no travelers from China were screened for potential exposure to the virus. Health screening began in mid-January  but only for a number of travelers who had been in Wuhan and only at the airports in Los Angeles  San Francisco and New York. By that time  about 4 000 people had already entered the United States directly from Wuhan  according to VariFlight  an aviation data company based in China. The measures were expanded to all passengers from China two weeks later. In a statement on Friday  Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  described Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions as a “bold decisive action which medical professionals say will prove to have saved countless lives.” The policy took effect  he said  at a time when the global health community did not yet “know the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread.” Trump administration officials have also said they received significant pushback about imposing the restrictions even when they did. At the time  the World Health Organization was not recommending travel restrictions  Chinese officials rebuffed them and some scientists questioned whether curtailing travel would do any good. Some Democrats in Congress said they could lead to discrimination. In interviews  multiple travelers who arrived after the screening was expanded said they received only passing scrutiny  with minimal follow-up. “I was surprised at how lax the whole process was ” said Andrew Wu  31  who landed at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Beijing on March 10. “The guy I spoke to read down a list of questions  and he didn’t seem interested in checking out anything.” Sabrina Fitch  23  flew from China to Kennedy International Airport in New York on March 23. She and the 40 or so other passengers had their temperature taken twice while en route and were required to fill out forms about their travels and health  she said. “Besides looking at our passports  they didn’t question us like we normally are questioned ” said Ms. Fitch  who had been teaching English in China. “So it was kind of weird  because everyone expected the opposite  where you get a lot of questions. But once we filled out the little health form  no one really cared.” In January  before the broad screening was in place  there were over 1 300 direct passenger flights from China to the United States  according to VariFlight and two American firms  MyRadar and FlightAware. About 381 000 travelers flew directly from China to the United States that month  about a quarter of whom were American  according to data from the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration. In addition  untold others arrived from China on itineraries that first stopped in another country. While actual passenger counts for indirect fliers were not available  Sofia Boza-Holman  a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security  said they represented about a quarter of travelers from China. The restrictions  she added  reduced all passengers from the country by about 99 percent. Mr. Trump issued his first travel restrictions related to the virus on Jan. 31  one day after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. In a presidential proclamation  he barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks. The order exempted American citizens  green-card holders and their noncitizen relatives — exceptions roundly recognized as necessary to allow residents to return home and prevent families from being separated. It did not apply to flights from Hong Kong and Macau. About 60 percent of travelers on direct flights from China in February were not American citizens  according to the most recently available government data. Most of the flights were operated by Chinese airlines after American carriers halted theirs. At a news conference about the restrictions  Alex M. Azar II  the health secretary  repeatedly emphasized that “the risk is low” for Americans. He added  “Our job is to work to keep that that way.” Health officials also announced an expansion of the screening beyond arrivals from Wuhan. Dr. Robert R. Redfield  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  explained that people would be screened for “significant risk  as well as any evidence of symptoms.” If there was no reason for additional examination  “they would be allowed to complete their travel back to their home  where they then will be monitored by the local health departments in a self-monitoring situation in their home.” The procedures called for screening to be conducted in empty sections of the airports  usually past customs areas. Passengers would line up and spend a minute or two having their temperature taken and being asked about their health and travel history. Those with a fever or self-reported symptoms like a cough would get a medical evaluation  and if they were thought to have been infected or exposed to the virus  they would be sent to a hospital where local health officials would take over. Passengers would also be given information cards about the virus and symptoms. Later versions advised people to stay at home for two weeks. In a statement on Thursday  the C.D.C. described the entry screening as “part of a layered approach” that could “slow and reduce the spread of disease” when used with other public health measures. “We cannot stop all introductions ” the C.D.C. added  noting that the coronavirus pandemic was “especially challenging due to asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections and an incubation period of up to two weeks.” Separately  on Friday  the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the administration’s measures were “unprecedented” and allowed “the U.S. to stay ahead of the outbreak as it developed.” Passengers including Mr. Wu described a cursory screening process when they arrived in the United States. Mr. Wu  who has had no symptoms and has not become ill  said he was told to stay inside for 14 days when he landed in Los Angeles. He said he received two reminder messages the next day by email and text  but no further follow-up. Another traveler  Chandler Jurinka  said his experience on Feb. 29 had an even more haphazard feel. He flew from Beijing to Seattle  with stops in Tokyo and Vancouver. At the Seattle-Tacoma airport  he said  an immigration officer went through his documents and asked questions unrelated to the virus about his job and life in China. At no point did anyone take his temperature  he said. “He hands me my passport and forms and says  ‘Oh  by the way  you haven’t been to Wuhan  have you?’” Mr. Jurinka said. “And then he says  ‘You don’t have a fever  right?’” Like others  he left the airport with a card that recommended two weeks of self-quarantine and a promise that someone would call to check up on him. He said he never got a call. Other travelers also said the follow-up from local health departments was hit-or-miss. Some received only emails or texts. Jacinda Passmore  23  a former English teacher in China who flew into Dallas on March 10  after a layover in Tokyo  got a thorough screening at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. It took about 40 minutes  she said  before she was cleared for her flight home to Little Rock  Ark. State health workers later dropped off thermometers at her house and insisted her entire family stay home for two weeks and provide updates on their condition. “They asked us every day: ‘Have you stayed inside? Have you met anyone? Have you been quarantined?’” Ms. Passmore said. “They’re really nice about it. They said  ‘If you need anything  we can go grocery-shopping for you.’” Nineteen flights departed Wuhan in January for New York or San Francisco — and the flights were largely full  according to VariFlight. For about 4 000 travelers  there was no enhanced screening. On Jan. 17  the federal government began screening travelers from Wuhan  but only 400 more passengers arrived on direct flights before Chinese authorities shut down the airport. Scott Liu  56  a Wuhan native and a textile importer who lives in New York  caught the last commercial flight  on Jan. 22. Mr. Liu had gone to Wuhan for the Spring Festival on Jan. 6  but decided to come back early as the outbreak worsened. At the Wuhan airport  staff checked his temperature. On the flight  he and other passengers filled a health declaration form  which included questions about symptoms like fever  cough or difficulty breathing. After they arrived at J.F.K. in New York  the passengers were directed to go through a temperature checkpoint. “It was very fast ” he said. “If your temperature is normal  they will just let you in.” Mr. Liu said no one asked him questions about his travel history or health  and he received a card with information about what to do if he developed symptoms. At the time  there were no instructions to isolate. Mr. Liu said he and his friends all decided to do so anyway. “I stayed at home for almost 20 days ” he said. About 800 passengers on five charter flights were later evacuated from Wuhan by the U.S. government and directed to military bases  where they waited out two weeks of quarantine. The charter flights began on Jan. 29. Instagram posts from one showed C.D.C. officials in full protective gear on the plane and escorting passengers after landing. One group of passengers was eventually flown to Omaha to be taken by bus to a National Guard camp for quarantine. Video showed them accompanied by a full police escort  with lights flashing  helicopters overhead and intersections blocked off along the way.

04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-hospital-brooklyn.html, nyregion, ‘Code Blue’: A Brooklyn I.C.U. Fights for Each Life in a Coronavirus Surge, Nearly every patient was on a ventilator. Some were in their 80s  some in their 30s. Medical workers were falling fast and had to be resourceful — “the alternative ” one said  “is death.”, Supported by Nearly every patient was on a ventilator. Some were in their 80s  some in their 30s. Medical workers were falling fast and had to be resourceful — “the alternative ” one said  “is death.” transcript A lot of times  doctors and nurses almost feel invulnerable  but it’s hard for them to see their colleagues being admitted to the hospital and not have that sense of invulnerability shattered. I’m Sheri Fink. I’m a correspondent at The New York Times. Many years ago  I went to medical school. Victor Blue  a photographer  and I spent some time at Brooklyn Hospital. “So what is he on  drug-wise?” This hospital  just within the last week  had almost doubled the capacity to treat patients in the intensive care unit. “The opportunity for beds here are pretty significant.” The staff members from all over the hospital were helping out  so there were nurses from the cardiac catheterization lab. There were podiatry physicians. There was a neurosurgery physician assistant helping out. I think what really stood out to me was the toll on the medical providers and the fact that so many of the staff members are sick. One of the hospital’s employees was admitted to the intensive care unit while I was there. “And we do that for our nurses  one  because they actually go through the most P.P.E.  because they have so many tasks they have to do.” Dr. Josh Rosenberg — he’s an intensive care unit doctor. I feel like he was bouncing on his toes the whole time. “Easier and I waste less P.P.E. And that way I’m in and all the rooms are done.” And then I found out that he himself had been out and this was his first day back. It just highlights how brave the people are for showing up every day and doing their work. “The blood gas looks pretty darn skippy.” In one case  a patient  their cardiac status — the ability of the heart to pump blood everywhere that it’s needed — was starting to have some problems. So  in this case  they were starting what’s called a central line. And that way  they could administer certain drugs that could help the heart. And  of course  any time that you’re close to a patient and performing a procedure  it can be a risk for the health care providers. But it’s not all doom and gloom. The doctors  the nurses  the staff members — they’re trying not to let it get them down  trying to focus on the task at hand. Obviously  this is super difficult. And when they go home at night  a lot of them describe just grappling with everything that they’re seeing and experiencing. But in the moment  they’re keeping each other’s spirits up. They’re going about the work. “Yeah  I’ll take care of that one.” When I would ask the health professionals who I was speaking with at the hospital whether they had anything else to say  whether they had a message for the larger public  their message has been: Stay home  protect yourself  reduce your risk  follow the recommendations so that you minimize the chance that you will get sick. And that helps them be able to take care of people who really need that help. By Sheri Fink The night had been particularly tough. Patient after patient had to be intubated and put on a ventilator to breathe. At one point  three “codes” — emergency interventions when someone is on the brink of death — occurred at once. Dr. Joshua Rosenberg  a critical care doctor  arrived the next morning at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. Within hours  he was racing down the stairwell from the main intensive care unit on the sixth floor to a temporary one on the third  where he passed one of his favorite medical students. “Shouldn’t you be home?” he asked  registering surprise. Clinical rotations for students had been halted to avoid exposing them to the coronavirus. “My mom’s here ” the student replied. Dr. Rosenberg  45  let out an expletive and asked which bed she was in. “I’m rounding there now ” he said and made sure the student had his cellphone number. Earlier  residents from the I.C.U. had presented their cases to Dr. Rosenberg and others  speaking in shorthand and at auctioneer-like speed. There were so many patients to get through last Monday: “Admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to likely Covid-19.” “Admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to confirmed Covid-19.” “Admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure  high suspicion of Covid-19.” Nearly every person lying in a bed in the new intensive care unit  just as in the main one  was breathing with the help of a mechanical ventilator. There were patients in their 80s and in their 30s. Patients whose asthma and diabetes helped explain their serious illness. And patients who seemed to have no risk factors at all. Patients from nursing homes. Patients who had no homes. Pregnant women  some of whom would not be conscious when their babies were delivered to increase their odds of surviving to raise their children. This was the week that the coronavirus crisis pummeled the Brooklyn hospital  just as it did others throughout New York City  where the death toll reached more than 2 000  as the governor warned that vital equipment and supplies would run short in just a few days  as the mayor pleaded for more doctors and as hospital officials and political leaders alike acknowledged that the situation would get even worse. At the Brooklyn center — a medium-size independent community hospital — that misery was evident. Deaths attributed to the virus more than quintupled from the previous week. The number of inpatients confirmed to have Covid-19  the disease caused by the virus  grew from 15 to 105  with 48 more awaiting results. Hospital leaders estimated that about a third of doctors and nurses were out sick. The hospital temporarily ran out of protective plastic gowns  of the main sedative for patients on ventilators  of a key blood pressure medication. The sense of urgency and tragedy was heightened by a video  circulating online  showing a forklift hoisting a body into a refrigerated trailer outside the hospital. Amid the unfolding disaster  in a week in which he would see more deaths  counsel some families to let loved ones go and scramble to save others  a weary Dr. Rosenberg paused to watch his team tend to their patients. “It’s making the best of what you can do ” he said. Dr. Rosenberg had to stay home the previous week  battling a fever and intense fatigue from what he assumed was Covid-19 (a test  taken after he felt better  later came back negative). He could barely climb the stairs to his bedroom. Returning to work this past Monday  he told a reporter  was like walking into a storm. “This is insanity ” Dr. Rosenberg said to a colleague that day. Before he left  the intensive care unit had its usual 18 beds. The surge was then hitting the emergency department  leading the hospital to construct a tent outside and screen scores of people a day. Many  mildly ill  were reassured and sent home. But during the time he was gone  the number of people progressing to severe illness skyrocketed  and the I.C.U. had to expand  then expand again  effectively doubling. “In a week’s time  we’ve transitioned from a crowding outside to a crowding inside ” said Lenny Singletary  the hospital’s senior vice president for external affairs. Even before the I.C.U.’s morning report had started  Dr. Rosenberg and other staff members had to rush to an outpatient unit. A middle-aged man had come to the hospital for dialysis but was sweating profusely. Staff members were about to help him breathe using a mask with pressurized air  known as a BiPAP machine. But Dr. Rosenberg  chair of the hospital’s infection control committee  thought it was a poor idea. There was no way to know right then whether the man’s illness might be caused by the coronavirus  and there were fears that the device could release virus particles into the air  potentially spreading the disease. The patient was moved to the emergency room. “He has a high chance of getting tubed” and needing a ventilator  Dr. Rosenberg told colleagues. In the new I.C.U.  a repurposed chemotherapy infusion unit  blue plastic gowns fluttered from door hinges  drying after being wiped down for reuse. A patient bed  tilted up like a slide  held pink plastic bins overflowing with patient supplies. Dr. Rosenberg’s critical care team assembled in mismatched clothing  masks and protective eyewear  hair and foot coverings — wearing much of the scarce equipment all day  not changing between patients. With so many staff members out and so many new patients  the array of doctors  nurses  pharmacists and respiratory therapists who were accustomed to working in the I.C.U. needed reinforcements. Dr. Rosenberg welcomed a podiatrist and two of her resident trainees  a neurosurgery physician assistant  surgery residents and a nurse anesthetist. “All people who are good with knives and big needles ” Dr. Rosenberg quipped. Now  some nurses were caring for five critically ill patients at a time  a ratio he called “crazy.” The norm for experienced I.C.U. nurses at the hospital was just two. At 10 a.m.  Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. James Gasperino  chief of medicine and critical care  jumped on a call with the hospital leadership about challenges the center was facing and how it was coping with them. The chief medical officer  Dr. Vasantha Kondamudi  later summed it up: Staff was short  medical residents were falling ill every day  and the number of patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 was ballooning in nearly every area of the hospital. Yet the crisis had not peaked. Nurses and others from departments that had cut back on services  like elective surgery and outpatient clinics  were being trained and redeployed. “You’re working completely differently ” said Judy McLaughlin  senior vice president and chief nursing executive. But even that wasn’t enough: The hospital had requested more than 100 volunteer doctors and nurses from the city’s Medical Reserve Corps and was rapidly working to vet them. After the call  Dr. Gasperino conferred in the hallway with the director of respiratory therapy. The hospital had 98 ventilators  many acquired in recent days  including small portable devices from the national stockpile. Employees were running simulations to practice how they might use each ventilator to treat two patients  a difficult and risky proposition. “We’re doing this because the alternative is death ” Dr. Gasperino said. An alert sounded on the loudspeaker  interrupting the conversation: “Code blue  6B. Code blue  6B.” The critical care team was designed to respond to emergencies anywhere in the hospital. Although he was supposed to be on his way home after an overnight shift  Dr. Gasperino joined more than than a dozen others pouring into the patient’s room. “Covid?” someone asked. “No  not Covid ” came the answer. Young residents stood on either side of the man’s bed and took turns doing chest compressions. Nurses ran out of the room and back in with supplies. Dr. Gasperino threaded a catheter into a large vein to infuse medication into the patient’s body. The man’s pulse returned. At about the same time  one of the pregnant patients was wheeled from the intensive care unit and into an operating room for a cesarean section. She was in her early 30s  and her baby was being delivered nearly two months early in an effort to save the mother’s life. Over the past day  doctors had ordered two doses of steroid medication to help the infant’s lungs mature. During rounds earlier that morning  a resident presented the woman’s case. She had been put on a ventilator and sedated the previous evening. Dr. Rosenberg cursed under his breath: This disease was cruel. As Dr. Rosenberg walked down the corridor  nearly every door he passed had a neon colored sticker warning that personal protective equipment must be worn inside. “COVID” was handwritten on many of them. Staff members had separated control boards from some of the ventilators  so they could adjust their settings and monitor patients without going inside their rooms unless necessary  reducing exposure to the virus. Nurses were making a similar adjustment with the pumps that delivered intravenous medications  adding extension tubing that snaked across floors into hallways. Workers rushed in and out of the rooms preparing for procedures. “Watch out  don’t trip!” Dr. Rosenberg warned a colleague. Moments later  he had to repeat the warning. “Watch out  don’t trip!” Later that day  when a patient became unstable  Dr. Rosenberg passed out masks with a face shield — “they’re clean  save them  they’re gold” — to staff members before they entered the man’s room. Dr. Rosenberg put on a sterile gown and ski goggles  which he said he preferred because they didn’t fog up. He inserted a narrow tube into a patient’s artery to better monitor his vital signs. Procedures performed inside the room  close to the patient  posed the greatest risk of exposure. Amid the grimness  Dr. Rosenberg tried to keep the mood positive  his energy fueled by espresso from an automatic machine in his office. He called his colleagues “dude ” made sports analogies to explain his points and sometimes asked how their families were dealing with the stress. Even in the thick of a crisis  he directed questions to trainees that forced them to think hard about the next step in care for each patient. Being a teacher came easily to him. He had studied science at Wesleyan — earning his degree in three years to save on tuition costs — and then taught it to first graders at the Choir Academy of Harlem  a now shuttered public school that was the home of the famous Boys Choir. He went on to medical school in Israel  later returning to New York  where he now lives with his wife and two daughters. Dr. Rosenberg and his team reviewed the status of one of the many patients who were receiving a “Covid cocktail” of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine  held up by President Trump as a potential cure  and the antibiotic azithromycin. Dr. Rosenberg referred to it as a “maybe-maybe-this-will-work cocktail ” because only a couple of tiny studies supported its effectiveness against Covid-19. Still  the doctors were prescribing it aggressively now  early in the course of hospitalization  in the hopes that it could prevent the lung damage that led patients to need ventilators. The cocktail is generally considered safe  though it may have serious side effects in certain patients. One man in the I.C.U. developed a deadly arrhythmia and had to be shocked back to life the night before Dr. Rosenberg’s Monday shift. The doctor told his residents that the patient should not go back on the drug. “I don’t think the public realizes how often we don’t really know” whether something works  Dr. Rosenberg said. Different coronaviruses can cause the common cold  which “affects all of us ” he said. “There’s no medicine to get better from it — it’s just time  patience.” What scared him with this new coronavirus  though  was the thought that “time and patience when somebody’s on a ventilator is different from time and patience when someone has the sniffles.” His team had also begun treating some patients with another medication  an experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir. But the hospital had to apply to the manufacturer  Gilead  for emergency permission to use it on each patient  who had to have a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. “Do we have a positive test?” Dr. Rosenberg asked about one patient. A colleague replied  “Not yet.” Test results from a Quest commercial laboratory in California had been taking about a week  making it harder to isolate infected patients within the building  provide certain treatments and even discharge people. Laboratory workers at the Brooklyn hospital managed to retrofit equipment and start their own testing last weekend  which doctors considered a game changer. But with one problem resolved  another arose. This past week  there were days when the hospital ran short of a drug to treat life-threatening low blood pressure in many of Dr. Rosenberg’s I.C.U. patients  as well as a sedative that many were receiving to relieve the distress of being on a ventilator. The doctors ordered substitutes. The chief pharmacist at the Brooklyn hospital  Robert DiGregorio  worked until after 2 a.m. on Thursday to try to source more of one drug. Going forward  Dr. Rosenberg predicted  “the biggest threat will be medication shortages.” Dr. Rosenberg was struck by the range of the patients felled by this illness — various ages  ethnicities and medical histories. Some who had been critically ill  most of them younger  were starting to recover enough to be taken off a ventilator and breathe on their own. But as he and his team stopped outside each room  they saw many who were from nursing homes and had multiple medical problems — the type of patients who filled the intensive care unit during flu season. Now some were extremely sick  with failing organs. “Very poor prognosis ” Dr. Rosenberg said about one man  in his 70s  who had developed kidney damage. “He’s going to pass from this.” “Has anyone been in contact with the patient’s family?” he asked. He asked a variation of that in front of other rooms. “All of these patients need a palliative care” consultation  the physician said of the seriously ill. The patients were alone. Visitors were no longer allowed into the hospital  and doctors had to call family members to update them  get their permission for doing procedures and — for many — discuss end-of-life care. That day and continuing through the week  Dr. Rosenberg had many difficult conversations  on the phone and often through translators  about shifting from trying to extend life to withdrawing life support and focusing on comfort. “A lot of family members don’t realize how sick the patients are or how bad the prognosis is with this disease if you develop respiratory failure ” he said  particularly in the context of advanced age and other health conditions. “The families really want to see their loved ones.” The team was using iPads and smartphones to connect them. He said that the state’s laws governing withdrawing patients from ventilators were complicated. The default  generally  is for doctors to initiate and continue providing life support unless the patient or proxy has clear directives otherwise. “It reflects on the need for these conversations in primary care well before somebody gets sick and for that information to be disseminated to family members.” He added  “There are an awful lot of really young patients in their 50s and 60s who I’m sure never thought about this.” There were fears throughout the week that New York’s hospitals would soon run out of ventilators and be forced to ration them  but doctors at the Brooklyn center said they had enough for now. Dr. Rosenberg worried more about having enough staff members and medications. Still  Dr. Rosenberg said that he and his colleagues were looking at protocols for how to ration care  developed by intensive care doctors at other medical centers  in case conditions worsened. The goal was to expand capacity to avoid the need to limit treatment. Gary G. Terrinoni  the hospital’s president and chief executive  said he had received donations of food and supplies  but was appealing to the city and state for physical beds  equipment and funds to “ensure we can serve the community” as his clinical colleagues fought “the good fight.” But even discharging those who no longer needed hospital care to make space for new patients was sometimes proving difficult. Dr. Rosenberg worried about getting one of his patients  ready to leave the I.C.U.  accepted back into a nursing home  where across the city staffing had fallen short. Government officials were working on sites to accept released patients  but those had not yet opened. Even death did not always guarantee an exit. By the end of the week  the hospital had accepted two refrigerated trailers from the city’s medical examiner. Workers were building shelves in one of them to make space for more bodies  as overwhelmed funeral homes were failing in some cases to retrieve them. A tent discouraged onlookers from recording more cellphone videos. Meanwhile  patients continued to arrive at the I.C.U. — some of them with ties to the 175-year-old institution  near Fort Greene. “It’s like home for us ” said Dr. Kondamudi  the chief medical officer. Dr. Antonio Mendez  the vice chair of the emergency department  was born at the hospital  and his mother  Josefina  was admitted as an I.C.U. patient. “She is a fighter and so are her doctors ” he said. On his first day back  Dr. Rosenberg checked her blood gas  a measure of the effectiveness of her breathing support. It “looks pretty darn skippy ” he said and praised his team for their management of her care. Late in that long day  Dr. Rosenberg learned that one of the hospital’s own medical residents  whom he knew well  was in the emergency room  with symptoms of Covid-19 and a worrisome chest X-ray. “He comes right up ” he told his team  “because he’s at high risk of getting intubated.” To admit the physician to the I.C.U.  however  Dr. Rosenberg had to get more staff. “We need more nurses ” he said. Given how overwhelmed they are  “they’re getting killed.” Soon after  two nurses who normally worked in the cardiac catheterization lab walked into the unit to offer their assistance. Dr. Rosenberg applauded. “This is the cavalry ” he said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/multimedia/05Virus-Brooklyn-p1-sub/merlin_171193407_c6e0ecf7-b317-420a-9711-bd59d5fc8fad-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/multimedia/author-sheri-fink/author-sheri-fink-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/05Virus-Brooklyn2/merlin_171193389_941d0e40-8079-4cb8-86bf-6f2e60cd1e26-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

The Virus Exposed How Unequal Their Lives Are., When they were all in the same dorms and eating the same dining hall food  the disparities in students’ backgrounds weren’t as clear as they are over video chat., Supported by When they were all in the same dorms and eating the same dining hall food  the disparities in students’ backgrounds weren’t as clear as they are over video chat. By Nicholas Casey The political science class was called “Forced Migration and Refugees.” Students read accounts of migrants fleeing broken economies and seeking better futures  of life plans drastically altered and the political forces that made it all seem necessary. Then suddenly  the subject matter became personal: Haverford College shut down and evicted most students from the dormitories as the coronavirus spread through Pennsylvania. Like many college courses around the country  the class soldiered on. The syllabus was revised. The students reconvened on a videoconferencing app. But as each logged in  not everyone’s new reality looked the same. One student sat at a vacation home on the coast of Maine. Another struggled to keep her mother’s Puerto Rican food truck running while meat vanished from Florida grocery shelves. As one young woman’s father  a private equity executive  urged the family to decamp to a country where infections were falling  another student’s mother in Russia couldn’t afford the plane ticket to bring her daughter home. “Now Russia is about to close its borders ” Sophie Chochaeva told her classmates  in the days before the country did. She was one of 135 students still on campus  in a dorm room she called “the cozy foxhole ” as the world outside became a ghost town. “This crisis is exposing that a lot of people don’t have anywhere to go.” The outbreak of the coronavirus — and the accompanying economic devastation that has left 10 million people almost instantly unemployed — has put America’s class divide on full display. Gig employees were the first to suffer  with many of their jobs vanishing without unemployment benefits. Office employees retreated to work-from-home arrangements while janitors cleaned the buildings they fled and delivery workers brought packages to their doorsteps. But college was meant to be different. For decades  small liberal arts schools like Haverford  a short ride from Philadelphia  prided themselves on being the “great equalizer ” offering pedigrees not just to the scions of East Coast elites but also to the children of first-generation immigrants. Scholarships filled in for family money. Students ate the same cafeteria food in the morning and bunked in the same creaky beds at night. No longer — at least not while the virus spreads through the country. “It’s as though you had a front-row view on American inequality and the ways in which it was disguised and papered over ” said Anita Isaacs  the course’s professor who has taught political science at Haverford since 1988. The first gulf war  the Sept. 11 attacks  the Great Recession — she had seen them all through the eyes of her students. “There’s been nothing like this before ” she said. Several nights before the class was to reconvene online in late March  Professor Isaacs received an email from one of her teaching assistants  Tatiana Lathion  a college senior whose parents own the food truck. Their source of income was on the verge of liquidation as stay-at-home orders loomed in Jacksonville  Fla.  where they lived. “I’m not sure my savings will allow them both to survive this quarantine and still keep the business ” she wrote. She said she was thinking of getting a part-time job at a grocery store. Wasn’t college supposed to get her away from all that? “I have this panic moment that it’s literally for nothing now ” Ms. Lathion wrote to her professor. Ms. Lathion had not thought she would attend college. College and the coronavirus. Her mother had grown up in Puerto Rico before moving to Indiana and then Florida  and while she had sought out good public schools for her children  she didn’t push for education beyond that. But Ms. Lathion had high grades and a college counselor suggested that she apply to QuestBridge  a nonprofit that matches low-income students with colleges offering full-tuition scholarships. As some high school seniors traveled the East Coast touring potential schools  Ms. Lathion asked her guidance counselor to pick out colleges that she thought would be a good fit. “I didn’t think I was going to get that scholarship ” she said  so it was a surprise to her when Haverford came back with a full ride. She had to learn where it was. “I was Googling Haverford  and was like  ‘Oh  I’m going to Pennsylvania  Mom ’” she said. If Ms. Lathion found Haverford by chance  the school’s recruitment of underprivileged students like her was more by design. The college was founded by Quakers in the 1830s and has a history of preaching equality and social justice. While tuition hovers around $73 000 a year  families earning less than $60 000 are exempted from taking out loans. By some metrics Haverford did better than most Ivy League schools in bringing in low- and middle-income students  despite having a far smaller endowment. Sensing the doors wide open  Ms. Lathion plunged into playing on the lacrosse team. The sport was dominated by white  upper-class players who often learned at Northeast prep schools  but the Haverford team quickly made a place on the field for Ms. Lathion  who had learned to play in Florida. The players wore the same uniforms  and even chose to live together on an apartment floor. But while her teammates vacationed or completed internships  Ms. Lathion spent her summers helping her parents make empanadas at their Florida food truck. In a text message chat last winter break  her teammates discussed Christmas plans with their families. Ms. Lathion revealed she was in Puerto Rico  staying with hers after a powerful earthquake. “She would send texts to the team group chat and say ‘Fifth day without power  hope you’re enjoying break!’” said Isabel Canning  a junior who played on the team. “I would Snapchat her back and ask if everything was OK.” Ms. Canning had Latin roots  too. Her mother emigrated from Portugal in the 1970s  then married into an established Maine family that ran a distribution business. Ms. Canning’s father ran the company before starting a consulting outfit of his own. Each summer the family headed to the seaside town of Boothbay  where Ms. Canning’s father had taught her to play lacrosse. By late January  as the coronavirus was moving beyond China  Ms. Canning saw a message from Ms. Lathion saying she planned to be a teaching assistant that coming semester. The two teammates discovered they had both been recruited by Ms. Isaacs to assist with her seminar on forced migration from Latin America. They were joined in class by Ms. Chochaeva  who as a child bounced between the homes of her separated parents  several subway stops from Moscow’s Red Square. She had taken English classes until her family could no longer afford them  and then taught herself. Before Haverford  she had never visited the United States. Like Ms. Lathion  Ms. Chochaeva imagined her prospects would dramatically change by attending college. She remembered lying on the floor and staring up at the ceiling when she found out she had been accepted to Haverford. “I felt like some kind of uncertainty ended  and a new kind of uncertainty began ” she said. Chace Pulley was one of the first in the class to realize the virus was having a big impact. Her father  an investor  had a trip planned to Japan  where he did business. Schools were closing. As Asian markets began to crash  Ms. Pulley’s parents assured her they had plenty of cash on hand  a decision they made after the Great Recession. Ms. Chochaeva had flashes of 2008  too. She was 9 when her mother lost her job in Russia and was forced into a pension; Ms. Chochaeva’s older brother  who suffered from a learning disability  developed diabetes  which required costly treatment. She remembered how food had disappeared from shelves  and called her mother to make sure she was fine. On March 4  Ms. Isaacs had her students stand at a chalkboard to create an enormous diagram of all the concepts they had studied in class. Students packed in and stretched over one another to draw connections like “fear and insecurity” and “familial connections.” It would be the last time the class would gather like that. During spring break in mid-March  Ms. Lathion and Ms. Canning were headed to a lacrosse game in Virginia that was suddenly canceled out of safety concerns. They had already been told Haverford was delaying the start of classes because of the virus; now came a message to students not to return that semester at all. Ms. Canning’s family quickly brought her to their summer home after she car-pooled to Maine with another student  leaving a family Land Rover on campus. Ms. Canning is on immunosuppressant drugs for a condition she developed on an educational trip to Kenya. An uncle who worked at the family distribution business gave her masks and gloves. Ms. Lathion returned home to find Latin Soul Grille  her family’s food truck and their only livelihood  was starting to fail. It was up to her to help keep it going. As the lacrosse players gathered up for a video conference Ms. Lathion arrived late; she’d spent the day on what she called a “scavenger hunt” to find what remaining meat was still available for the truck at grocery stores. By then  Ms. Pulley had made it to her family’s home in Hillsborough  Calif.  a wealthy community with sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay. Her father had wanted the family to come with him to Japan  where he had traveled for business in the past and where infections seemed to be subsiding  but they ultimately decided to stay in California. Andreanna Papatheodorou  another student in the seminar  tried to move back in with her mother  who had once been an undocumented immigrant from Argentina. But the pandemic made her mother anxious  and it became too much for Ms. Papatheodorou  who decided to return to Haverford. “I said one less person in and out is better for you guys ” she said  before returning to Pennsylvania. “If I get sick  you can’t take care of me.” When the class meets on Wednesdays at 1:30 on the Zoom app  the students discuss the virus and the ways it will affect the migrants they were learning about before the outbreak. But the conversation increasingly works its way to their own fate. “Both my parents are priests ” began Hannah Stanley  who had retreated to Baltimore. “They had to close the church. Now they’re wondering  after months of quarantine how long it will take for people to come back.” Sofia Bomse  in New Mexico  was disheartened. “I would like to think there will be a call for radical social change now  but I don’t think that’s going to happen ” she said. “The gap between the super rich and everyone else will widen.” After class  Professor Isaacs thought back to the email that she had gotten from Ms. Lathion. She said after she read it  she called to make sure her student was all right. “I watched her as she cried through this screen and I kept thinking if it weren’t for coronavirus  we would be sitting together and I’d be able to physically reach out ” she said. “And I couldn’t do any of that and it was devastating.” She added: “It’s possible to believe that we can bridge inequalities by coming together on the Haverford campus  or that we can at least soften the edges — and then there is this incredible rupture. I’m very worried about what comes next for them.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — Remember the impeachment? President Trump does. Even in the middle of a deadly pandemic  he made clear on Saturday that he remained fixated on purging the government of those he believes betrayed him during the inquiry that led to his Senate trial. The president’s under-cover-of-darkness decision late the night before to fire Michael K. Atkinson  the intelligence community’s inspector general who insisted last year on forwarding a whistle-blower complaint to Congress  swept away one more official deemed insufficiently loyal as part of a larger purge that has already rid the administration of many key figures in the impeachment drama. Mr. Trump made no effort at a news briefing on Saturday to pretend that the dismissal was anything other than retribution for Mr. Atkinson’s action under a law requiring such complaints be disclosed to lawmakers. “I thought he did a terrible job  absolutely terrible ” Mr. Trump said. “He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress.” Capping a long  angry denunciation of the impeachment  he added  “The man is a disgrace to I.G.s. He’s a total disgrace.” Mr. Trump’s hunt for informers and turncoats proceeds even while most Americans are focused on the coronavirus outbreak that has killed thousands and shut down most of the country. The president’s determination to wipe out perceived treachery underscores his intense distrust of the government that he oversees at a time when he is relying on career public health and emergency management officials to help guide him through one of the most dangerous periods in modern American history. “It was a Friday Night Massacre  a purely vindictive decision with no apparent purpose other than punishing the inspector general for doing his job ” said Chris Whipple  the author of “The Spymasters ” a coming history of C.I.A. directors to be published in September. “What’s next? Unmasking the whistle-blower and hauling him into the dock? The signal here to the intelligence community is  do not dare tell the president what he doesn’t want to hear.” At his briefing on Saturday  Mr. Trump likewise endorsed the firing of Capt. Brett E. Crozier of the Navy  who was removed from command of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt after sending his superiors a letter pleading for help for his virus-stricken crew. “He shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter ” the president said. “I thought it was terrible what he did.” While appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate  inspectors general are government watchdogs traditionally granted a great deal of independence so that they can ferret out waste  fraud and other misconduct in government agencies without fear of reprisal. But Mr. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he has little regard for the positions  which were created by Congress after Watergate to increase government accountability  and expects executive branch officials to serve his interests. His administration has quarreled with various inspectors general and more than a dozen such positions are currently unfilled. When Mr. Trump signed the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package  he issued a signing statement saying he will not allow a special inspector general created by the law to monitor spending to send reports to Congress without his supervision. On Friday night  even as he fired Mr. Atkinson  Mr. Trump nominated Brian D. Miller  a White House aide  as the special inspector general for the relief spending  raising questions about how beholden he will be to the president in scrutinizing the execution of the largest such stimulus program in history. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Mr. Miller’s selection missed the point of what such an oversight official’s mission should be. “To nominate a member of the president’s own staff is exactly the wrong type of person to choose for this position ” Mr. Schumer said on Saturday. Mr. Schumer’s office released a letter that Mr. Atkinson sent the senator on March 18 in response to concerns about whistle-blowers. “As you know  the past six months have been a searing time for whistle-blowers and for those who work to protect them from reprisal or threat of reprisal for reporting wrongdoing ” Mr. Atkinson wrote. Promised protections are meaningless if whistle-blowers are “vilified  threatened  publicly ridiculed or — perhaps even worse — utterly abandoned by fair weather whistle-blower champions.” Mr. Trump’s dismissal of Mr. Atkinson was the latest instance of the president continuing to pursue his personal and policy agenda while the nation has been consumed by the pandemic. He rolled back car pollution rules and used the virus to justify tougher controls at the border with Mexico and a new rule undercutting federal unions. Mr. Trump acted against the inspector general two months after the Senate voted almost entirely along party lines to acquit him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to incriminate Democrats while withholding desperately needed security aid. But even as he has been managing the pandemic response  impeachment remains on Mr. Trump’s mind. In a Fox News interview this past week  Mr. Trump blamed Speaker Nancy Pelosi for impeaching him rather than facing the looming coronavirus threat. “All she did was focus on impeachment ” he said. “She didn’t focus on anything having to do with pandemics  she didn’t focus on — she focused on impeachment and she lost. And she looked like a fool.” That is a theme Republicans have picked up  arguing that the focus on ousting Mr. Trump over what they called bogus charges distracted the country. “It diverted the attention of the government  because everything every day was all about impeachment ” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  told the radio host Hugh Hewitt. Mr. Trump  however  denied that it distracted him. “Did it divert my attention?” he replied to a reporter. “I think I’m getting A-pluses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment. OK? It was a hoax.” “I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached. OK?” he added. “And I think that’s a great tribute to something; maybe it’s a tribute to me. But I don’t think I would have acted any differently or I don’t think I would have acted any faster.” Mr. McConnell later told The Washington Post that he meant Congress was distracted  not the government. The Senate trial ended Feb. 5  just days after Mr. Trump ordered the country closed to most travelers from China  where the virus outbreak began. During the trial and long after it was over  Mr. Trump was playing down the seriousness of the coronavirus  likening it to the ordinary flu and predicting that “like a miracle it will disappear.” It was not until March 11  five weeks after the trial  that he first addressed the nation from the Oval Office  and not until March 13 that he declared a national emergency. After the Senate trial ended  Mr. Trump began removing officials seen as enemies. The target list was long and varied  including Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman  a national security aide who testified before the House under subpoena  and his twin brother  Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman  who had nothing to do with impeachment other than being family. Ambassador Gordon D. Sondland  another witness  was removed. Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr.  the acting chief diplomat in Ukraine who also testified  was brought home early. John C. Rood  the under secretary of defense  was ousted. Joseph Maguire  the acting director of national intelligence  was pushed out early. Elaine McCusker  a Defense Department official who questioned the aid freeze had her nomination to be Pentagon comptroller withdrawn. Jessie K. Liu  who prosecuted Mr. Trump’s friend  Roger J. Stone Jr.  had her nomination to be under secretary of the Treasury withdrawn. Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  who admitted at a news briefing that the security aid was held up in part to leverage Ukraine to investigate Democrats (and then tried to take his statement back)  was fired on March 6 even as the pandemic was beginning to spread more widely. As the intelligence community’s inspector general  Mr. Atkinson received the whistle-blower complaint filed last August by a C.I.A. official about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. Mr. Atkinson concluded that he was required by law to disclose the complaint to Congress  but the Trump administration initially refused until pressured by lawmakers. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that Mr. Atkinson should not have forwarded the whistle-blower’s complaint because it was fake  but in fact the bulk of the information included in it was verified by witness testimony and other evidence collected by House investigators. “Why was the whistle-blower allowed to do this?” Mr. Trump asked. “Why was he allowed to be — you call him fraudulent  or incorrect transcript. So we offered this I.G. — I don’t know him  I don’t think I ever met him. He never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person? Never came in to see me. Never requested to see me. He took this terrible inaccurate whistle-blower report — right? — and he brought it to Congress.” Mr. Atkinson’s dismissal on Friday night  a time often used by a White House to bury news it prefers not to gain widespread attention  was disclosed in a letter to Congress but not announced by the White House press office. While it had been anticipated  it still sent waves of concern among lawmakers and intelligence veterans. “It’s awful. He did everything right ” Gen. Michael V. Hayden  a C.I.A. director under President George W. Bush  said of Mr. Atkinson. Mr. Trump  he added  was flouting the purpose of an inspector general. “He’s just doing it because he can do it.” Democrats issued statements of protest on Saturday. “Weakening our national security institutions is bad enough during a time of global calm ” said Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California. “During the current instability we’re faced with  it’s particularly dangerous.” Senator Charles E. Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said Mr. Trump should provide more justification for firing an inspector general. “They help drain the swamp  so any removal demands an explanation ” Mr. Grassley said in a statement. “Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when I.G.s are removed for a lack of confidence. More details are needed from the administration.” Senator Richard M. Burr  Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  was more tempered  noting that an inspector serves at the pleasure of the president. “However ” he added  “in order to be effective  the I.G. must be allowed to conduct his or her work independent of internal or external pressure. It is my hope the next nominee for the role of I.C.I.G. will uphold the same important standards laid out by Congress when we created this role.” As it happened  one inspector general who has earned Mr. Trump’s favor for his report criticizing the F.B.I.’s handling of the Russia investigation stood by Mr. Atkinson. Michael E. Horowitz  the inspector general at the Justice Department and head of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency  said Mr. Atkinson was known “for his integrity  professionalism  and commitment to the rule of law and independent oversight.” “That ” Mr. Horowitz added  “includes his actions in handling the Ukraine whistle-blower complaint.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/us/politics/04dc-trump/merlin_171268860_81b8f2df-a989-427c-8134-727f2a58ed8b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v2.png 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-antibodies.html, world europe, In Italy  Going Back to Work May Depend on Having the Right Antibodies, Weighing an idea that might once have been relegated to science fiction  Italy once again finds itself in the unfortunate vanguard of Western democracies grappling with the coronavirus., Supported by Weighing an idea that might once have been relegated to science fiction  Italy once again finds itself in the unfortunate vanguard of Western democracies grappling with the coronavirus. By Jason Horowitz ROME — There is a growing sense in Italy that the worst may have passed. The weeks of locking down the country  center of the world’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak  may be starting to pay off  as officials announced this week that the numbers of new infections had plateaued. That glimmer of hope has turned the conversation to the daunting challenge of when and how to reopen without setting off another cataclysmic wave of contagion. To do so  Italian health officials and some politicians have focused on an idea that might once have been relegated to the realm of dystopian novels and science fiction films. Having the right antibodies to the virus in one’s blood — a potential marker of immunity — may soon determine who gets to work and who does not  who is locked down and who is free. That debate is in some ways ahead of the science. Researchers are uncertain  if hopeful  that antibodies in fact indicate immunity. But that has not stopped politicians from grasping at the idea as they come under increasing pressure to open economies and avoid inducing a widespread economic depression. The conservative president of the northeastern Veneto region has proposed a special “license” for Italians who possess antibodies that show they have had  and beaten  the virus. The former prime minister  Matteo Renzi  a liberal  has spoken about a “Covid Pass” for the uninfected. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that while the lockdown remained in place  the government had begun working with scientists to determine how to send people who have recuperated back to work. With its echoes of a “Brave New World ” the debate about how to reopen arrived in earnest this past week in Italy. Like the virus’s crushing toll — 15 362 dead in Italy as of Saturday evening — the shift is ahead of countries like Spain  Britain and the United States  where the contagion is still on an upswing. Italy was the first European country to announce a nationwide lockdown  which it began on March 9. But the rate of new infections slowed this week — on Saturday  there were about 4 800 new cases  less than in recent weeks — leading officials and emergency medical workers alike to talk with guarded optimism. “We are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel ” said Fabio Arrighini  a supervisor of an ambulance hotline in the Lombardy town of Brescia  which has one of the highest death rates in Italy. “The calls have gone down.” But the debate over an antibody-based work force has once again placed Italy at the unfortunate vanguard of Western democracies grappling with the virus  its uncomfortable ethical choices and inevitable aftermath. Such questions have already been raised by the wrenching decisions of doctors to treat the young  with a better chance of life  before the old and sick. But at some stage  nearly all governments will have to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and getting their countries running again. They may also find themselves weighing what is best for society against individual rights  using biological criteria in ways that almost certainly would be rejected absent the current emergency. “It looks like it splits humanity into two  the strong and the weak ” said Michela Marzano  a professor of moral philosophy at the Paris Descartes University. “But this is actually the case.” From an ethical perspective  she argued  the question of using antibodies as a basis for free movement reconciles a utilitarian vision of what is best for society with respect for individual humanity by protecting “the most fragile  not marginalizing them.” “It’s not discriminating ” she said. “It’s protecting.” Scientists in Italy  like their counterparts in Germany  the United States  China and beyond  are already studying whether antibodies are a potential source of protection or immunity from the virus. China has slowly reopened its economy  focusing on preventing another wave of infection arriving from overseas. In New York  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has envisioned a strategy in which younger people  and people who have antibodies showing they have been cured of the virus  can go back to work. No country has been hit harder by the coronavirus than Italy  and no province has suffered as many losses as Bergamo. Photos and voices from there evoke a portrait of despair. The British government has floated the idea of “immunity passports ” though it is still struggling to complete even swab tests for an accurate snapshot of current infection levels  and the virus has not been present long enough in the British population to provide enough antibody data. Italy  by dint of its early and widespread exposure to the virus  has an opportunity to gain insight into how the virus works and the biological properties that protect against it. Next week  Veneto plans to begin collecting 100 000 blood samples from people across the region — first from thousands of health care workers and then public employees — to study in labs the antibodies of people who have the virus and those who have healed from it. Nowhere in Italy is the pursuit of the antibody strategy more intense than in Veneto. With its wealth of resources  high-profile consultants and biotech presence  it may now be uniquely positioned to influence the global conversation and provide insights for the rest of the world. The region sits adjacent to the hard-hit Lombardy region  and one of its towns  Vo’  had Italy’s first fatality from the virus and was one of the first towns in the country to be quarantined. Vo’ also has a relatively homogeneous genetic pool  which may facilitate research  and it has been widely tested. After the outbreak  officials there took the extraordinary step of swab-testing the entire population of 3 000  including people without symptoms. That helped eliminate an outbreak  and now officials plan to carry out antibody testing and genome sequencing on the entire population to try to detect patterns in who was and was not susceptible to the virus. Those results  expected in three or four months  perhaps could shed light on why some remained asymptomatic while others got sick  whether those who didn’t get infected already had antibodies and whether children had something that helped them avoid sickness. “Italy has at the moment  of course  one of the largest pools of infected people that have recovered from the infection ” said Andrea Crisanti  the top scientific consultant on the virus in Veneto and a professor of microbiology at the University of Padua. He added that it was “a unique and valuable set of information and data.” Dr. Crisanti emphasized the need for a carefully designed strategy to unlock Italy that would make use of contact tracing  protective gear and aggressive testing of post-virus antibodies. “The planning ahead is one of the most important things ” Dr. Crisanti said. “Because it’s easy to lock down.” Without a proper strategy for the path ahead  “the most likely outcome is that the epidemic starts again.” Scientists in Italy said the virus resulted in two types of antibodies  a first that usually appears within five to six days after exposure to the virus  and which fades after 20 days. As a person heals  that antibody  which indirectly shows contagion  is slowly replaced by another antibody  which indirectly shows that a person has had the virus. When only the second antibody is detected  it means the person is probably no longer infected. “You are most likely a healthy person that either survived the infection or you were asymptomatic and you have developed antibodies ” Dr. Crisanti said. In Veneto  the regional president  Luca Zaia  has expressed concern about a single case of “a person who got better and got reinfected ” but he and his consultants appear confident about the potential of antibodies. The antibodies in healed Italians could be a valuable tool in determining who could safely exit quarantine to work  Dr. Crisanti said. He argued that the small town of Vo’ presented ideal conditions for antibody and genome testing. “The good thing about Vo’ is that this is a community that has been in place for several hundreds of years and with probably very little mixing ” he said  giving a clearer genetic picture. Giuliano Martini  the mayor of Vo’  said that he and the people in his town were grateful for the aggressive testing  which potentially saved hundreds of lives. Once the central government in Rome lifted an initial quarantine on Vo’ in the beginning of March  Mr. Martini said  the comprehensive testing identified people who were infected but asymptomatic and kept them from spreading the disease. Putting the town at the disposal of researchers looking to learn more about the virus and its antibodies is “the least we can do ” he said. “We have to recognize this effort done for us by making ourselves available for future tests ” he said  adding that the town continued to be a gold standard in Italy for active surveillance  and that “we know the name and surname” of all the people who remain in quarantine. For residents reluctant to take part in the new study  which he acknowledged was more intrusive as it was a blood test  he said  “We go see them in their homes and convince them.” “There isn’t going to be any problem for this second test ” he said. “It’s an additional check on them  it can’t be anything but positive.” But the outcomes may not be great news for individuals who  potentially under the law  will remain marginalized from society. In Veneto  Mr. Zaia has proposed that Italians in possession of antibodies showing they no longer have the virus could obtain a “license” that allows them to move around the country and work. Dr. Luisa Bracci Laudiero  an immunologist at the Italian National Research Council  said that the antibodies “should be protective  we all hope they are  but we don’t have the mathematical certainty.” Because Italy was further along in cases  researchers are able to track many patients over a long period of time to determine if immunity had developed. “We find ourselves being a bit of a laboratory ” she said.

04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-spanish-flu-philadelphia-pennsylvania.html, us, The Killer Flu of 1918: A Philadelphia Story, , The brutal toll taken by the flu that claimed 20 000 lives in the city has not been forgotten as Philadelphia braces for the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. An anti-spitting sign posted on streetcar in Philadelphia  October 1918.Credit...Historical Medical Library of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia Supported by By Dan Barry and Caitlin Dickerson PHILADELPHIA — At Sunday family dinners  the grandchildren would beg to hear that story again  the one about her twins in the baby carriage  and one of them was dead  and what did she do. This was when Sarah Jane Anderson would add to the collective memory of a Philadelphia nightmare. Well  children … It was October 1918  and the raging flu epidemic had killed 18-month-old Augusta  but spared her twin  Eleanor. Funeral parlors could not meet the demands of the dead; caskets were stacked on the sidewalks. But Ms. Anderson had a plan: She knew an undertaker in northeast Philadelphia. She tucked the twins — one alive  one dead — in a baby carriage  left their rowhouse in Camden  N.J.  and took the Delaware River ferry to Philadelphia. As she wheeled her sorrow north  fearful that she might be arrested for moving a body across state lines  people kept peeking into the carriage to admire how peacefully the toddlers were sleeping. Twins? Aren’t they cute? Six miles later  Ms. Anderson reached the undertaker; he accepted the tiny body. She then retraced her steps with little Eleanor  who grew up to become the mother of Janice Williams  who heard her grandmother tell this story long ago  and now — in the midst of another pandemic — feels compelled to share it. “She walked home ” marveled Ms. Williams  84. The United States was crippled by the brutal flu that swept through the country in the midst of the First World War  but nowhere was hit more forcefully than the powerhouse industrial cities of Pennsylvania  the nation’s primary manufacturing hub for ships and steel needed in the war effort. More than 17 500 Philadelphians died of the flu in the first six months; 4 500 in one week; 837 in a single day  Oct. 12. Much from that time has the sudden ring of familiarity: the shattering consequence of holding a large public event — a patriotic parade featuring marching bands  Boy Scouts and troops before cheering crowds packed 15 feet deep on the sidewalks — in defiance of scientific advice to stay at home. The overwhelmed health care workers and morticians  and the many citizens who rose to the moment. The fight against an invisible foe whose capriciousness meant that a child died but her twin lived. Philadelphia has not sidestepped the 2020 coronavirus. Cases reached 2 430 by the end of the week; hundreds more are added every day and 26 people have died. But the city may not be as overwhelmed as some others. The public health commissioner sprang into action soon after word emerged of the virus in China  holding meetings with hospital administrators as early as January. Testing equipment was purchased early  and Temple University offered space for additional hospital beds. The city expects to have sufficient beds to withstand even a worst-case scenario  though it is scrambling to secure the needed equipment  including ventilators. Dr. Tony S. Reed  chief medical officer at Temple University Hospital  said that Philadelphia’s ordeal in 1918 — enduring the second-highest death rate in the country  next to Pittsburgh — has informed its response to the current epidemic. “The state has handled it very differently  and the city handled it radically differently ” he said. “Frankly  for us it’s going to make all the difference in the world.” Nancy Bader Thomas  a retired bond underwriter  said she had thought often in recent days of the similarities between the now she is living and the then that both her parents experienced in 1918 Philadelphia. “It happened again. We’re reliving it ” Ms. Bader Thomas said. “History can repeat itself.” Stirred by the onset of Covid-19  the Philadelphia memories of 1918 have helped  but they also haunt. The initial wave of the flu arrived in Philadelphia aboard a British merchant ship that docked at the city’s Navy Yard. Within days  600 sailors fell ill. Philadelphia’s health director  a gynecologist named Dr. Wilmer Krusen  initially denied that the city had a flu problem  hoping that isolating the sick would limit the outbreak. He faced a difficult decision: shut down the city  or hope that quarantines would suffice. But the United States was also embroiled in a world war. Philadelphia felt intense pressure to recruit soldiers  churn out warships — and demonstrate its second-to-none patriotism with an elaborate parade to boost morale and encourage the purchase of war-financing bonds. “If Krusen had decided not to go ahead with the parade  knowing that all cities were doing it  they would have sacked him ” said Robert Hicks  a historian who created a 1918 flu exhibit for the Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. “There’s no way it could have been stopped.” On Sept. 28  an estimated 200 000 people — about one-ninth of the city’s population — packed downtown for the rousing procession of floats and troops. War widows held court on street corners. Schoolgirls in white marched arm in arm. Citizens bought bonds. And a virus spread. Two days later  Dr. Krusen acknowledged that the city was in the throes of an epidemic — but it was too late: Philadelphia did not have a chance. Hundreds of police officers came down with a “blue flu ” impeding law enforcement. Telephone switchboard operators fell ill  disrupting communication. Schools and public venues closed  funeral processions competed for street space and church bells tolled incessantly for the dead. But many Philadelphians responded as if to the war posters festooning the city: They did their part. A citizens committee redirected its efforts from fighting the war to fighting the flu  partitioning the city and assigning medical professionals to each section. Families sheltered orphans; a private school  Girard College  received a class of orphaned “flu kids.” Volunteers dug mass graves. Then the epidemic was over  as suddenly as it had arrived. While other major cities experienced multiple harsh waves of the flu  Philadelphia was for the most part hit with blunt force only once. Soldiers traumatized by war returned to families traumatized by an epidemic. But Philadelphia moved on. Now  in the spring of 2020  another epidemic has hit  and this city of 1.5 million  like many other communities  is bursting with absence. No packs of commuters erupting from 30th Street Station. No tourists swarming about Independence Hall. No fans streaming into the Wells Fargo Center to see 76ers basketball or Flyers hockey. Girard College is closed for the epidemic. The Navy Yard  now an industrial park  is mostly deserted but has a coronavirus testing site. And few people linger at the corner of Broad and Chestnut  where many thousands once gathered for a glorious and deadly parade. Although historical markers throughout the city commemorate assorted people  places and moments — America’s first Bible society; Girl Scout cookies; the singer Mario Lanza — there is no public marker memorializing the 1918 epidemic. Too painful  perhaps. Best forgotten. But there has been that exhibit at the Mütter Museum. Even before it opened in October  the exhibit  “Spit Spreads Death: The Influenza Pandemic of 1918-19 in Philadelphia ” was generating calls and emails from people who had stories to tell. “They do not talk about the experiences in a detached  retrospective way ” Mr. Hicks  the museum’s former director  said. “They talk about really desperate times and anguish. It’s not just  ‘Oh  my great-grandfather died from the flu.’ It’s something intimate and personal  as if the person telling us the story witnessed the event themselves.” Nancy Hill  the museum’s manager  agreed. She noted that since the city’s effective shutdown last month because of the coronavirus  there has been a spike in emails to the museum from people with epidemic stories to share. People like Ms. Williams  who remembers those Sunday dinners of the 1940s  when she and other children would swarm around their plump grandmother Sarah Jane Anderson  who had had a hard life and who loved to play Chinese checkers  begging her to tell the story again. It always began with: The baby was very sick  and the baby died. As if her grief were stipulated. The baby’s twin  Eleanor  lived to be 83. She married  volunteered at a hospital thrift shop  remained loyal to the Phillies — and  according to her daughter  often wondered how life might have been had her twin survived. The baby-carriage story inherited by Ms. Williams is just one moment among so many that unfolded almost simultaneously throughout Philadelphia  where children on the street could be heard reciting variations of a new ditty: I had a little bird  Its name was Enza. I opened the window  And in flew Enza. When even loosely assembled  these moments provide a cinematic narrative of terror  mourning and resilience that resounds today. It resounds like the bells of the churches in the Grays Ferry neighborhood  where 9-year-old Isabel Gallagher would walk past coffins stacked outside St. Gabriel’s Roman Catholic Church. Then  at home  her father would prescribe hot toddies of whiskey  hot water and sugar. Isabel lived to be 91  her daughter  Barbara Selletti  said. “And until the day she died  she believed that what saved her were the hot toddies.” In South Philadelphia  nothing could save Amilia Coia  26  a wife and mother with lustrous long black hair  from the insidious flu. Her 7-year-old son  John Angelo Coia  also developed the flu  and the sips of whiskey and the pouch of garlic tied around his neck had no effect. At some point  a Roman Catholic priest loomed over him to administer last rites. But the child recovered. He grew up  married  worked for 46 years as a printer for The Philadelphia Inquirer  and died at 83. In his retirement  he would sip a coffee or beer with his son Anthony and summon those dark days — recalling the friends who were missing when fresh air returned to the streets. “He would go out to play ” recalled Anthony Coia  73  “and little Billy wouldn’t be there.” Ms. Bader Thomas  the retired bond underwriter  is the custodian of the influenza stories passed on by her parents  both of whom grew up around the West Kensington neighborhood. Her mother  Irene  would tell the cautionary tale of a neighbor  a big  strong German in his 40s  who drove a six-horse wagon loaded with beer barrels. “He was in superior shape to be able to do that kind of work ” said Ms. Bader Thomas  77. “And he was gone within a couple of days.” This was one reason Irene’s grandmother  an Austrian immigrant named Bertha  kept all her family members isolated in the house — and they all survived. Irene  in fact  lived to be 104. Ms. Bader Thomas’s father  Walter  was 17 when he got hired to do a job few wanted: collect the dead by horse and wagon. “They had to work fast ” she recalled her father saying. “They just threw them in the ground  blankets wrapped around them.” He and other morgue workers drank whiskey to protect themselves from the flu and  maybe  the memories. But when those memories returned in later years  Ms. Bader Thomas said  her father would be matter-of-fact about even the horrific details  such as burying several babies in a barrel so as to be more efficient. “It was just: This is what happened ” she said. “You just go forward ” said Ms. Bader Thomas  self-isolating in her home in a Philadelphia suburb. “You never look back.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/05Virus-SpanishFlu2/00VIRUS-SPANISHFLU-03-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-dan-barry/author-dan-barry-thumbLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-caitlin-dickerson/author-caitlin-dickerson-thumbLarge-v2.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/us/00VIRUS-SPANISHFLU-04/00VIRUS-SPANISHFLU-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-24-hours-america.html, us, 24 Hours in a Pandemic Nation, A virtual recovery meeting. A police officer donned a face mask. A pastor without a congregation. A funeral director trying to bury the dead. This is a new America., Supported by A virtual recovery meeting. A police officer donned a face mask. A pastor without a congregation. A funeral director trying to bury the dead. This is a new America. By The New York Times Illustrations by Joana Avillez  The merciless threat slipped into America  emptying its streets  shuttering its stores. In this new America  once crowded cities now feel abandoned.   But there are also new kinds of connections. This was America over 24 hours this week. On pause and full-tilt  as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation. The merciless threat slipped into America  emptying its streets  shuttering its stores  wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors. In this new country  once crowded cities now feel abandoned  as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation’s highways. “Closed” signs hang from the front doors of business after business. For many  this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight — for life  for food  for money. For others  it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside — a fight against boredom  binge eating  isolation. There was Kalee Kamer  in Portsmouth  Ohio  27 months sober and motivated to stay that way  participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison  patrolling the quiet city of Norman  Okla.  in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee  a pastor in Newton  N.C.  without a congregation  summoning hope amid the gloom. This was America over 24 hours this past week  on pause and full-tilt  as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation. 6:30 a.m. A trip to a ventanita  in Miami culture  is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip  a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter. Or at least they were. Flouting social distancing rules  crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas  so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio’s  where the espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz  rushed to tape markers — six feet apart — on the ground. Now customers approach with caution  peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag. “This is my only outing ” said Daisy Abreu  58  who works in magazines and left with one café con leche  one guava pastry and two empanadas. But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa  a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He  too  had given up most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita. — Patricia Mazzei 8 a.m. Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed  strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe. Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m.  she was standing outside  shivering with her husband  fingers crossed she would snag a package. One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. “I’ve been rationing two squares a trip ” said Ms. Maloney  63. In the grand scheme of things  a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty. Inside the locked store  clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside  everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees  exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day. “It’s starting to get ugly ” Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other — “Don’t shake his hand!” one shouted. The doors slid open  and Ms. Maloney strode inside. — Jack Healy 10 a.m. Tonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade  only now with no children to pick up and none to drop off. They were all at home  stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta. But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch  most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount’s work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School  loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch  and then delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets  more like the driver of an ice-cream truck. “I know my children ” she said. “I know who is in need.” Every few blocks  Ms. Blount  55  stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. “How many babies?” a co-worker in the back of the bus would ask them  smiling  handing the bags down. Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush  19  came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia  the amusement park. Not anymore  he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch. — Richard Fausset 11:40 a.m. Thalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair  centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and a dresser. “Hi  B!” she called out to the screen. “How’s the dogs?” “They’re trouble ” the screen replied. Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises  which are modeled loosely after ballet  to mostly women in their 20s  30s and 40s. When Boston shut down  her clients begged her to come up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic. Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis  as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left. She called the group to attention. “All right guys  let’s go!” Nurses  bartenders  teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen  following her through a routine of squats and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome. “Kerry  that’s a beautiful pace!” she said. “Maite  lower your hips an inch.” Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. “You’re in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body  and you’re in an emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world ” she said. “And it’s like  we’re going to get through this together  just like we do with every single class.” — Caitlin Dickerson 12:30 p.m. Ariana Lee  a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College  walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: “Admittance Restricted.” The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. “Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa  please?” These days  with classes now online  campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall  Ms. Lee  a senior  encountered only one other person  a janitor pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room  like a lone ship leaning into a storm. The servers wore gloves  but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off. The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic  she said  but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town  though  because “people on the street say racist things.” The other day  a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help. Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant. Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room  unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas  an orange  a cardboard bowl of rice  a cardboard box of chicken tacos. She looked at it  as if it were a still-life painting  and did not eat. — Anemona Hartocollis 2:04 pm The milk incident happened right after lunch  when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day  the first set off by a missing sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud  but at least it didn’t involve spilling milk all over the dining room table. A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago  Tanying Dong  39  has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed in a lesson and his little brothers  ages 2 and 5  are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids  Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her paying job  in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives. Three boys  at prime havoc age  with no school  no day care  no babysitter  no playgrounds  no friends and  for much of the time  no other adult. Amid it all  she has taken up sewing. Specifically  face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong’s husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist  and while the children’s hospital is not yet a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms  things could change quickly. The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She’ll know tonight when she picks it back up  once the kids are in bed. — Campbell Robertson 2:49 p.m. Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan  approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn’t touch them. He reached instead for his cellphone. “OK  I’m just going to take a picture of that ” Officer Allison told the man. Officer Allison  34  patrols southwest Norman  where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now  and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations. Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters  but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when they go out on calls. On Tuesday  the officer’s lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake  tea and wrapped straws. At the end of his shift  he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house  walk inside and hug his wife  5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now  he pulls straight into the garage  undresses there  stuffs his uniform into the washing machine  disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone. It turned out that the Chrysler’s license plate didn’t match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn’t registered it yet. From the driver’s seat of the S.U.V.  the officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask. — Manny Fernandez 4:16 p.m. Kimberley Mitchell  a second-generation funeral director  gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing  her only goal was to help them hang on to the tiniest bit of cultural tradition. Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell’s Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago  she would have placed her hand on the relative’s shoulder as a gesture of comfort. On this afternoon  she gently laid out the dizzying  surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the chapel. It has 22 rows of pews — room for seven mourners  a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal. “It feels something like ‘to be continued’ for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones ” she said. Before the crisis  Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now  it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts  one small group at a time. It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring. But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms — “joy cometh in the morning.” “The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone ” she said. “Think about that. Alone.” — Audra D.S. Burch 5:01 p.m. Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired  but he was also a man on a mission. He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out  straight to City Hall  where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a curfew. In February  Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula  a Gulf Coast city of about 21 000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification. But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. “This is Dr. Steve  your mayor ” he tells them  dressed in green scrubs behind the mayor’s desk. Tomorrow he would make another video  about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart. His advice is not limited to physical health. “Keep trusting  keep praying ” he said in one video. “We will get through this together.” — Rick Rojas 7 p.m. Kalee Kamer was in bed  snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat  Dirtball  participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live. Ms. Kamer — 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin  meth  crack and whatever else she could get her hands on — lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March 15. She and her boyfriend  Chris Keeton  who is also in recovery  have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a week. In this small city  the center of Ohio’s opioid epidemic  temptation is never far. The couple’s gazes are fixed on the Facebook session  hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction. Kathy Newman  a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery  urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as viewers cheered in support. Hundreds of comments appeared in real time — testaments of hope and despair that would  in normal times  be shared face-to-face. I’m afraid of picking up the needle again … I need out. I’m in rehab. April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration. Ms. Kamer  32  wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven’t seen my son in 3.5 years  been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I’m still clean! #goals It was one voice in an ocean. I got 31 days. First time watcher. I am so close to breaking. — Dan Levin 9 p.m. The schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty  its doors locked shut  and outside  the birds are louder than what is left of traffic in one of America’s most congested cities. All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts  the guys selling beers out of coolers  the guys scalping tickets  the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots  blocked off with signs that now say “No public access.” Solitary joggers passed by  one after another  under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug. Alex Wood  the 29-year-old left-hander  was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now  the Rockies would be finishing batting practice  and Mr. Wood would be in the clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead  he’s a few hundred miles away in Arizona  crashing at a teammate’s house. He said he was throwing most days  and just trying to maintain “some semblance of sanity.” During what would have been game time  he said  he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping. Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. “Let that excitement continue to build ” he said  “and let it loose once we start our season.” — Tim Arango 11 p.m. Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate  queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty. Ms. Danahy  58  lost her job as a server at Steak ’n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that  she lost the income needed to pay the first month’s rent — $600 — on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment. A co-worker she had been staying with left town  leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop  drawing down curtains attached with Velcro  sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence. “Leading up to this  I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself ” she said. The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate  which was on its way in the mail. A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around. — John Eligon 12:40 a.m. Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal. She has been writing in it since early March  after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation’s deaths  a crunch of supplies  quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty. “As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus  I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.” She told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit unused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping  leaving groceries at her daughter’s doorstep and stepping back. “Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them ‘I love them!’ My grandson saying  ‘It’s OK  Granny  I can give you an invisible hug!’ as he stretched his arms out …” For the first time in 14 years  her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients. Ms. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman  like a lock of hair or an EKG strip. “I can’t even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it’s contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.” — Mike Baker 1 a.m. In the manner of academic scientists during normal times  at the end of a day that was light years from normal  Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data. Never mind that the prestigious University of California  Berkeley  biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin Shiao  31  was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner. What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus. And the data was good. “Awesome work ” typed Jennifer Doudna  a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute  as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao’s graphs from her living room. The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists  whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus genes in a patient’s nasal swab. Dr. Doudna  the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR  has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1 000 samples a day. But first  the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect. As some of Dr. Lin Shiao’s colleagues appended congratulatory “clapping” and “on fire” icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive  others looked ahead  to when they would begin again. — Amy Harmon 5 a.m. The sky over Central Park was slate gray  with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city’s stubborn glow. The East Meadow  its lush grass preserved by fences and “Keep Off” signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics  was instead bathed in a sea of white medical tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city’s overwhelmed hospitals. The tents — 14 in all — were empty  save for 68 portable metal beds  neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows. Samaritan’s Purse  a Christian charity  drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate  the city will supply the patients. In the I.C.U. tent  there were 10 beds  each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world — a ventilator  which can cost upward of $50 000. Samaritan’s Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia  to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in Ecuador  and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State. A few weeks ago  it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona  Italy  the nation with the world’s most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan. — Timothy Williams 6 a.m. The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk  picked up his fountain pen and began to write. Even in normal times  Mr. Lee  27  is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines  including Sunday church  he has been waking up earlier and earlier  no need for an alarm. He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the “collective pain” shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife  who lost hours at her marketing job. He thinks about his mother  a hospice nurse. And  if he is being honest  he thinks about himself  his own mortality. A year and a half ago  a lung collapsed during an asthma attack  leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak. A few weeks ago  as the crisis intensified  he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far  he has received more than 300: I am alone in California and far from family. I just lost my job today. I feel lonely and unsettled in these times. Mr. Lee  a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments  sees the current crisis as another pivotal moment for the country. Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties — and a small act of resistance. “It’s a sense of  we’re going to show up ” he said. “The coronavirus is terrible  but it’s not the fullness of who we are as a people. It’s not the end of our story.” — Sarah Mervosh Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html, world europe, A German Exception? Why the Country’s Coronavirus Death Rate Is Low, The pandemic has hit Germany hard  with more than 100 000 people infected. But the percentage of fatal cases has been remarkably low compared to those in many neighboring countries., Supported by The pandemic has hit Germany hard  with more than 100 000 people infected. But the percentage of fatal cases has been remarkably low compared to those in many neighboring countries. By Katrin Bennhold They call them corona taxis: Medics outfitted in protective gear  driving around the empty streets of Heidelberg to check on patients who are at home  five or six days into being sick with the coronavirus. They take a blood test  looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization  even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins. “There is this tipping point at the end of the first week ” said Prof. Hans-Georg Kräusslich  the head of virology at University Hospital in Heidelberg  one of Germany’s leading research hospitals. “If you are a person whose lungs might fail  that’s when you will start deteriorating.” Heidelberg’s corona taxis are only one initiative in one city. But they illustrate a level of engagement and a commitment of public resources in fighting the epidemic that help explain one of the most intriguing puzzles of the pandemic: Why is Germany’s death rate so low? The virus and the resulting disease  Covid-19  have hit Germany with force: According to Johns Hopkins University  the country had more than 100 000 laboratory-confirmed infections as of Monday morning  more than any other country except the United States  Italy and Spain. But with 1 584 deaths  Germany’s fatality rate stood at 1.6 percent  compared with 12 percent in Italy  around 10 percent in Spain  France and Britain  4 percent in China and nearly 3 percent in the United States. Even South Korea  a model of flattening the curve  has a higher fatality rate  1.8 percent. No country has been hit harder by the coronavirus than Italy  and no province has suffered as many losses as Bergamo. Photos and voices from there evoke a portrait of despair. “There has been talk of a German anomaly ” said Hendrik Streeck  director of the Institute of virology at the University Hospital Bonn. Professor Streeck has been getting calls from colleagues in the United States and elsewhere. “‘What are you doing differently?’ they ask me ” he said. “‘Why is your death rate so low?’” There are several answers experts say  a mix of statistical distortions and very real differences in how the country has taken on the epidemic. The average age of those infected is lower in Germany than in many other countries. Many of the early patients caught the virus in Austrian and Italian ski resorts and were relatively young and healthy  Professor Kräusslich said. “It started as an epidemic of skiers ” he said. As infections have spread  more older people have been hit and the death rate  only 0.2 percent two weeks ago  has risen  too. But the average age of contracting the disease remains relatively low  at 49. In France  it is 62.5 and in Italy 62  according to their latest national reports. Another explanation for the low fatality rate is that Germany has been testing far more people than most nations. That means it catches more people with few or no symptoms  increasing the number of known cases  but not the number of fatalities. “That automatically lowers the death rate on paper ” said Professor Kräusslich. But there are also significant medical factors that have kept the number of deaths in Germany relatively low  epidemiologists and virologists say  chief among them early and widespread testing and treatment  plenty of intensive care beds and a trusted government whose social distancing guidelines are widely observed. In mid-January  long before most Germans had given the virus much thought  Charité hospital in Berlin had already developed a test and posted the formula online. By the time Germany recorded its first case of Covid-19 in February  laboratories across the country had built up a stock of test kits. “The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses ” said Dr. Christian Drosten  chief virologist at Charité  whose team developed the first test. By now  Germany is conducting around 350 000 coronavirus tests a week  far more than any other European country. Early and widespread testing has allowed the authorities to slow the spread of the pandemic by isolating known cases while they are infectious. It has also enabled lifesaving treatment to be administered in a more timely way. “When I have an early diagnosis and can treat patients early — for example put them on a ventilator before they deteriorate — the chance of survival is much higher ” Professor Kräusslich said. Medical staff  at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus  are regularly tested. To streamline the procedure  some hospitals have started doing block tests  using the swabs of 10 employees  and following up with individual tests only if there is a positive result. At the end of April  health authorities also plan to roll out a large-scale antibody study  testing random samples of 100 000 people across Germany every week to gauge where immunity is building up. One key to ensuring broad-based testing is that patients pay nothing for it  said Professor Streeck. This  he said  was one notable difference with the United States in the first several weeks of the outbreak. The coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress last month does provide for free testing. “A young person with no health insurance and an itchy throat is unlikely to go to the doctor and therefore risks infecting more people ” he said. On a Friday in late February  Professor Streeck received news that for the first time  a patient at his hospital in Bonn had tested positive for the coronavirus: A 22-year-old man who had no symptoms but whose employer — a school — had asked him to take a test after learning that he had taken part in a carnival event where someone else had tested positive. In most countries  including the United States  testing is largely limited to the sickest patients  so the man probably would have been refused a test. Not in Germany. As soon as the test results were in  the school was shut  and all children and staff were ordered to stay at home with their families for two weeks. Some 235 people were tested. “Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that ” Professor Streeck said. Germany also learned from getting it wrong early on: The strategy of contact tracing should have been used even more aggressively  he said. All those who had returned to Germany from Ischgl  an Austrian ski resort that had an outbreak  for example  should have been tracked down and tested  Professor Streeck said. Before the coronavirus pandemic swept across Germany  University Hospital in Giessen had 173 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators. In recent weeks  the hospital scrambled to create an additional 40 beds and increased the staff that was on standby to work in intensive care by as much as 50 percent. “We have so much capacity now we are accepting patients from Italy  Spain and France ” said Susanne Herold  a specialist in lung infections at the hospital who has overseen the restructuring. “We are very strong in the intensive care area.” All across Germany  hospitals have expanded their intensive care capacities. And they started from a high level. In January  Germany had some 28 000 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators  or 34 per 100 000 people. By comparison  that rate is 12 in Italy and 7 in the Netherlands. By now  there are 40 000 intensive care beds available in Germany. Some experts are cautiously optimistic that social distancing measures might be flattening the curve enough for Germany’s health care system to weather the pandemic without producing a scarcity of lifesaving equipment like ventilators. “It is important that we have guidelines for doctors on how to practice triage between patients if they have to ” Professor Streeck said. “But I hope we will never need to use them.” The time it takes for the number of infections to double has slowed to about nine days. If it slows a little more  to between 12 and 14 days  Professor Herold said  the models suggest that triage could be avoided. “The curve is beginning to flatten ” she said. Beyond mass testing and the preparedness of the health care system  many also see Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership as one reason the fatality rate has been kept low. Ms. Merkel  a trained scientist  has communicated clearly  calmly and regularly throughout the crisis  as she imposed ever-stricter social distancing measures on the country. The restrictions  which have been crucial to slowing the spread of the pandemic  met with little political opposition and are broadly followed. The chancellor’s approval ratings have soared. “Maybe our biggest strength in Germany ” said Professor Kräusslich  “is the rational decision-making at the highest level of government combined with the trust the government enjoys in the population.” Christopher F.

By Denise Grady and Andrea Kannapell President Trump said on Saturday that the federal government was placing millions of doses of a malaria drug in the federal stockpile of emergency medical supplies to make it available for coronavirus patients  even though the drug has not been approved for Covid-19 treatment and his top coronavirus advisers have warned that more study is needed to determine its safety and efficacy. Though advisers  including Dr. Anthony Fauci  have cautioned many times that more data is needed on the drug  hydroxychloroquine  Mr. Trump  in a White House briefing  went so far as to urge patients to take it. “What do you have to lose? Take it ” the president said. “I really think they should take it. But it’s their choice. And it’s their doctor’s choice or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it  if you’d like.” During the briefing  as Dr. Fauci and other advisers looked on  the president talked about the potential of other medicines  too. He mentioned azithromycin  often referred to as a Z-Pak  which has been given to some patients along with hydroxychloroquine. “The other thing  if you have a heart condition  I understand  probably you stay away from the Z-Pak. But that’s an antibiotic. It can clean out the lung. The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus.” In addition to treating malaria  hydroxychloroquine is also prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis  lupus and some other autoimmune diseases. Laboratory studies in cultured cells have suggested that it may block the coronavirus from invading cells. And some researchers think its ability to dial back an overactive immune system — the reason it is used for autoimmune diseases — might help relieve the life-threatening inflammation that develops in some coronavirus patients. Still  there is no definitive proof that it works against the coronavirus  and it does not have Food and Drug Administration approval for that use. Early reports from China and France suggested that it could help  but the studies had flaws that made the findings less than reliable. Many researchers have called for controlled clinical trials to determine once and for all whether hydroxychloroquine has any value for coronavirus patients. A more recent study from China was conducted more carefully than the earlier ones  and found that the drug did help  but the study was small  included only mildly ill patients and its authors said more research was needed. Mr. Trump seized on the drug several weeks ago  at one point saying it would be a “game changer” in the course of the pandemic. Hoarding and a run on the drug followed  leaving patients who rely on the drug for chronic diseases wondering whether they would be able to fill their prescriptions. On Saturday  he continued with that message. “If this drug works  it will be not a game changer because that’s not a nice enough term. It will be wonderful ” he said. “It will be so beautiful. It will be a gift from heaven if it works.” With no proven treatment for the coronavirus  many hospitals in the United States have simply been giving hydroxychloroquine to patients  reasoning that it might help and probably will not hurt  because it is relatively safe. But it is not considered safe for people with abnormal heart rhythms. At the Saturday briefing  Dr. Stephen Hahn  commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  said the agency had given special permission for imported hydroxychloroquine to be used in the United States  in part to make sure that there would be enough for patients who need it for chronic diseases like lupus. On Friday  Dr. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  warned Americans against assuming the drug would be a silver bullet against the coronavirus  noting that evidence of its effectiveness was scant and more studies were needed. But on Saturday  Mr. Trump continued to wax enthusiastic. “We’re going to be distributing it through the Strategic National Stockpile ” he said  adding  “we have millions and millions of doses of it. Twenty-nine million to be exact.” The Department of Health and Human Services directed questions to the Strategic National Reserve  which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump said he also had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India about procuring millions more doses of hydroxychloroquine from that country. He also said there was a study indicating that patients with lupus did not contract the coronavirus  implying that perhaps their use of hydroxychloroquine was protecting them. “They should look at the lupus thing. I don’t know what it says  but there’s a rumor out there that because it takes care of lupus very effectively as I understand it  and it’s a  you know  a drug that’s used for lupus. So there’s a study out there that says people that have lupus haven’t been catching this virus. Maybe it’s true  maybe it’s not.” It is not clear what study he was referring to. Researchers from China did report that they noticed that their lupus patients had not caught the virus  but the observation was anecdotal  not proof. At the briefing on Saturday  Dr. Fauci said the observation was worth studying. Zach Montague contributed reporting.

Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/video/04virus-drug-image/04virus-drug-image-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/politics/coronavirus-state-department.html, us politics, When the Face of America Falls Ill: A Virus’s Toll on Diplomats, State Department employees are vulnerable and stressed by the coronavirus as it sweeps around the world  prompting thousands of American citizens to return to the United States., Supported by State Department employees are vulnerable and stressed by the coronavirus as it sweeps around the world  prompting thousands of American citizens to return to the United States. By Lara Jakes WASHINGTON — The symptoms were more annoying than alarming: A dry cough  achiness and then sniffles developed a few days after Andrew Young  the American ambassador to Burkina Faso  met with government officials and aid organizations to discuss how to protect the West African nation from the coronavirus. A week later  Mr. Young was sealed in an isolation chamber and loaded into an evacuation flight out of the capital  Ouagadougou  as the first United States ambassador to learn he had the virus. He is unlikely to be the last. Already  154 State Department employees worldwide have tested positive for the virus and more than 3 500 are symptomatic and in self-isolation  the vast majority of them serving in posts overseas. The pursuit of diplomacy is mostly idealistic  if usually faceless and often thankless. But outside conflict zones  it is rarely deadly. Even the most placid assignments come with security guards and other protective measures. The coronavirus has changed that. Diplomats  whose very jobs are to interact with foreigners and to represent 20 million Americans who are abroad at any given time  have been highly vulnerable to the pandemic as it swept around the world and into countries that have been slow to acknowledge its threat  many whose medical facilities are less than adequate to start. Three State Department employees have died from the coronavirus so far  all of whom were foreign citizens who were hired by the embassies in their respective home nations. One was from Indonesia and another from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The State Department did not disclose on Friday where the third person was from  except to say that he or she was not an American citizen. On March 20  the day before Mr. Young tested positive  President Trump described the State Department as the “Deep State Department” — a jab at what he sees as a disloyal diplomatic corps. He delivered it during a coronavirus briefing as he stood next to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who minutes later said of the president  “I know how much he values the people that work on my team.” It was left to Representative Eliot L. Engel  the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  to defend the State Department staff. “These men and women aren’t a ‘deep state ’” Mr. Engel  Democrat of New York  said later. “They’re our leading edge in working to protect Americans in the farthest corners of the world.” At the start of last week  there were only 43 kits available in Burkina Faso to test for coronavirus infection  Mr. Young said. The country currently has one of the highest numbers of infections in Africa — as of Friday  there were at least 288 confirmed cases and 16 deaths. Mr. Young was evacuated on March 25 on a flight that was chartered by the State Department to bring him and 120 healthy passengers home from Burkina Faso and Liberia. As soon as the plane landed at Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington after a 29-hour journey  he was suited up in full biohazard gear and whisked off to a hospital for several days of treatment. He considers himself lucky. And he wants to return to Burkina Faso as soon as the State Department will let him. “My treatment is not the same treatment that your average Burkinabe will receive in the coming challenges  because the situation is going to get more difficult in the couple of weeks ahead of us ” Mr. Young said in an interview this week as he recovers at home in the Washington area. “So I carry that.” So far  the State Department has brought back more than 38 000 citizens and their relatives — many of them tourists  students or Americans who live overseas. That includes about 6 000 diplomats and family members. Another 22 000 American citizens are still waiting  frustrated by the dwindling number of available flights  foreign regulations and other complications that have slowed their return. At both ends of the process are American diplomats who either are working abroad to get necessary departure permits from foreign governments  or are part of a Washington-based task force focused on lining up transportation and health services for stranded citizens. In some cases  that has meant renting buses to pick up Americans in remote locations and take them to the nearest international airport. In others  it has involved negotiating with foreign officials to approve the flights when public airports are closed  or to allow cruise ships with U.S. citizens among infected passengers aboard to dock. Some State Department employees in Washington have voluntarily reported to the task force operations center  to take over the night shift  after completing their daily diplomatic duties. “It’s an incredibly fast-paced  fluid challenge ” said Robert W. Forden  the deputy ambassador to the American Embassy in Beijing  who is now running the department’s coronavirus global response team in Washington. “The reaction  the responses have been shifting almost hourly. So it’s a constant struggle.” It has also put State Department employees at risk of infection. In Washington  some Foreign Service officers have questioned why they must report for duty at the State Department’s headquarters instead of teleworking  as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged most of the nation’s work force. Guidance issued on Wednesday  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  requests that State Department employees work from home “unless there is a critical mission need for you to be at the office ” but still allows senior-level supervisors to decide which diplomats qualify. There are 171 U.S. embassies and 87 consulates around the world; all but two remain open. Those two — consulates in Vladivostok  Russia  and Wuhan  China  where the coronavirus originated — were shuttered this year because of the outbreak. But 12 other American diplomatic missions are not fully staffed and many officials worldwide have returned to the United States as the pandemic spread. About two-thirds of the diplomats and contractors posted to the United States Embassy in Beijing and Consulates elsewhere in China  for example  have left. Several hundred remain. Tests for the virus also have been unavailable in some posts to diplomats who worry they could be exposed — putting not just themselves  but also those around them in danger. “People accept a significant level of risk in this career ” said Eric Rubin  a former ambassador to Bulgaria who is now the president of the union that represents career diplomats. But  he said  there is a need for clear  consistent guidance and the department largely has dealt with the coronavirus “bureau by bureau and post by post.” None of the U.S. diplomats among the roughly 70 American and Chinese employees at the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan has tested positive for the virus  said Jamie Fouss  the consul general who led its emergency closing on Jan. 28. A month earlier  diplomats there had become aware of a new  fast-moving virus in Wuhan that attacked the respiratory system  and alerted supervisors at the American Embassy in Beijing in late December. Mr. Fouss said he woke up one morning in mid-January to learn that the airport and some roads in Wuhan were closing  with more to follow in the coming days. Emergency food supplies were checked; evacuation routes were debated. Even after the State Department secured a flight to bring home the consulate’s American staff  diplomats had to negotiate with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reopen roads for the drive to the airport. The Chinese government also prohibited any people with Chinese passports from leaving  Mr. Fouss said. Temperatures were taken before boarding and several times during the long flight home  which landed on Jan. 29 at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside  Calif. The plane was greeted by a C.D.C. officer  who informed all passengers that they would be held there under a 14-day federal quarantine — the first imposed in the United States since the 1960s. “His hands are shaking  and you can tell he’s very nervous  because he’s expecting this huge uproar from us ” Mr. Fouss said. “And one of my officers said  ‘Well  will you set it up so we can watch the Super Bowl?’ And he said  ‘Yes  I think we can do that.’ And everybody laughed and cheered.” So far  Mr. Young is the only American employee at the U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou who has tested positive for the virus  although two local staff members have  and several others have gone into self-quarantine as a precaution. More than half of the staff and all family members have been evacuated over the last few months  leaving only a few dozen diplomats and other employees. They are all either working from home in Burkina Faso or otherwise maintaining social distance from others. Although he never ran a fever  his own diagnosis “was a wake-up call that people needed to be really serious about the type of tools that are available to everyone to slow down the spread of the virus ” Mr. Young said. Over the last week  Mr. Young said  10 000 coronavirus tests have been donated to Burkina Faso from one of China’s most prominent businessmen  the Alibaba founder Jack Ma. The World Health Organization has sent 2 000 more  he said. Even before he tested positive  Mr. Young had worried about the virus’s effect on Burkina Faso’s fragile democracy in the middle of a terrorist threat and a growing numbers of refugees. He said he was eager to return. “I’m working with a really brave population ” he said. “They sacrificed for their democracy and now they are fighting a horrific villain in Al Qaeda and ISIS. And they are stepping up.” He added  “I want to be part of helping them succeed.” Catie Edmondson contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home.

04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/asia/india-modi-citizenship-muslims-assam.html, world asia, ‘Muslims Are Foreigners’: Inside India’s Campaign to Decide Who Is a Citizen, Tribunal members in the state of Assam say they felt pressured to declare Muslims noncitizens as the government seeks to expel illegal migrants. Some politicians have vowed to take the process nationwide., Supported by Tribunal members in the state of Assam say they felt pressured to declare Muslims noncitizens as the government seeks to expel illegal migrants. Some politicians have vowed to take the process nationwide. By Karan Deep Singh and Suhasini Raj JORHAT  India — For nearly two years  Mamoni Rajkumari  a lawyer  spent her days deciding who was an Indian citizen and who was not  as part of a tribunal reviewing suspected foreigners in the state of Assam. Then  she says  she was dismissed for not declaring enough Muslims to be noncitizens. “I was punished ’’ she said. Ms. Rajkumari  54  has found herself on the front line of India’s citizenship wars. In addition to the tribunals  which Assam has operated for decades  the state has also recently completed a broader  separate review of every resident’s paperwork to determine if they were citizens. That review found that nearly two million of Assam’s 33 million residents  many of them desperately poor  were possibly foreigners. Now this group — which is disproportionately Muslim — is potentially stateless. What’s happening in Assam is a preview of what may be coming to India as a whole as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to pull the country away from its foundation as a secular  multicultural nation and turn it into a more overtly Hindu state. CHINA NEPAL ASSAM PAKISTAN New Delhi INDIA MYANMAR BANGLADESH Bay of Bengal SRI LANKA 500 MILES By The New York Times The New York Times interviewed one current and five former members of the Assam tribunals that review suspected foreigners. The five former members said they had felt pressured by the government to declare Muslims to be noncitizens. Three of them  including Ms. Rajkumari  said they were fired because they did not do so. State and central government officials declined to comment. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has its roots in a Hindu nationalist worldview  and during last year’s national elections  party leaders vowed to apply the same type of citizenship checks used in Assam to the rest of India. Mr. Modi has recently denied he has any such plans. Like Assam  India is majority Hindu  with a large Muslim minority. In December  India’s national government passed a sweeping new immigration law that gives a fast track to citizenship for undocumented migrants from nearby countries as long as they are Hindu or one of five other religions. Muslims are excluded. The upshot is that any Hindus left off Assam’s citizenship lists after its broad review  or declared by tribunals to be foreigners  will likely be affirmed as citizens because of the new immigration law. Muslims may not. “Increasingly  it is looking like Muslims are becoming a target ” said Binod Khadria  an expert on migration who is a former professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. “It’s a charged situation.” Even before the citizenship review  an indigenous rights movement in Assam  in northeast India on the border of Bangladesh  had been agitating for the government to expel foreigners. The police — sometimes acting on reports from private citizens — had referred more than 433 000 residents as “suspected foreigners ” according to parliamentary documents  and sent them to tribunals like the one Ms. Rajkumari sat on to produce documents or witnesses to prove they are truly Indian. Now  the citizenship review has produced 1.9 million new “suspected foreigners.” So Assam is adding more foreigner tribunals to adjudicate their cases. The whole tribunal process has troubled Ms. Rajkumari and some others who have served as tribunal members  generally hearing cases on their own. Many poor Indians lack the required paperwork to prove citizenship  like parents’ voting records and land ownership documents that have been certified by authorities as authentic. What’s more  the choice of who is labeled a suspected foreigner seems to have a religious bias to it  with a much higher percentage of Muslims sent to the tribunals than Hindus  according to Ms. Rajkumari and the tribunal members interviewed. Some of those current and former tribunal members spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the government. Although the tribunals are not technically courts  they function as if they were. If they find that someone cannot prove his or her citizenship  that person can be sent to detention  often within a jail. Kartik Roy  a lawyer and another former tribunal member  said “most of the references’’ that police officers made to his tribunal to investigate suspected foreigners “were against Muslims.” He said the pressure was clear: “You have to declare ‘foreigners’ means you have to declare the Muslims ” he said. Ms. Rajkumari agreed  saying state officials “think Muslims are foreigners.” Some of the tribunal members interviewed said they felt pressure in general to find more “foreigners ” with a monthly requirement to report how many cases they had heard and of those  how many people had been declared foreigners. Two other former members said officials in Assam’s Home and Political Department  which from 2016 has been controlled by Mr. Modi’s political party  had complained that they were not declaring enough people noncitizens. The former tribunal members said the complaints relayed to them were a form of indirect but heavy pressure. Tribunal members who declared more people foreigners had their performance rated as “good ” which increased their chances of keeping their jobs  according to court documents viewed by The Times. The performance of those who didn’t declare enough people foreigners was marked as “not satisfactory.” Both Ms. Rajkumari’s and Mr. Roy’s names appeared on that review list with a note against their names  saying they “may be terminated.” That is exactly what happened. The terms of Ms. Rajkumari and Mr. Roy were not renewed in 2017. They both said that because the bulk of people in front of the tribunals were Muslims  the expectation was that they would declare Muslims as foreigners  paving the way to deport them  incarcerate them or take away fundamental rights. The director general of police in Assam and other state officials declined to comment. Mr. Modi and top officials in his party have denied targeting Muslims in the Assam citizenship check  saying it was meant purely to identify illegal migrants. The Home Ministry in New Delhi  which ultimately oversees citizenship and residency rules in India  also declined to comment  citing the demands of the coronavirus crisis. Most of the migrants in Assam came from Bangladesh  at one time or another. Many have lived in Assam for generations  the descendants of economic migrants from decades ago. And many are illiterate and poor  often with no idea how to read the papers vital to proving a citizenship claim  and keeping them out of jail. Bangladesh  a predominantly Muslim country  and one of the poorest and most densely populated nations in the world  has expressed zero enthusiasm in taking migrants back. The passage of the national citizenship law sparked protests in Assam and across the country  and they continued to flare up until Mr. Modi imposed a coronavirus lockdown across India in late March. Dozens of people in Assam whose citizenship has been questioned have killed themselves  according to Indian media reports. Countless others fear being expelled from India or thrown in jail. Mr. Modi’s government doesn’t seem to be devising any plans to deport millions of people. But it is expanding its capacity to incarcerate foreigners; an enormous detention facility is under construction in the Goalpara district of Assam  where up to 3 000 people are likely to be held. The compound  set to open in a few months  has thick  high walls on the periphery  watchtowers in every corner  separate sections for men and women  and an infirmary. In July 2017  Ms. Rajkumari  Mr. Roy and 12 other former tribunal members sued the government for wrongful dismissal  disputing the government’s rating of their work. They lost the case. Ms. Rajkumari  who continues to practice law  said that what the government pressured her to do was wrong. A few weeks before she was fired  she recalled  she visited her mother. “Ma  how will I accomplish this task?” Ms. Rajkumari remembered asking her  tears streaming down her face. “Because it is very illegal.” Anupam Chakravartty contributed reporting from Guwahati  India.

By Carol Rosenberg This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. GUANTÁNAMO BAY  Cuba — During a court session this year in the case of the men accused plotting Sept. 11  defense lawyers spotted something curious: Prosecutors were huddled around a wireless silver tablet computer. When confronted about it  the judge made a surprising disclosure. He had secretly approved use of the device to allow real-time communication between prosecutors and representatives of the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies monitoring the trial from afar. The purpose  he said  was to allow the agencies to signal when they were concerned about a potential “spill ” the inadvertent disclosure of classified information. “Spills cannot occur ” said the judge  Col. W. Shane Cohen  defending his decision to give the agencies a way to relay requests to silence the court audio. “That is the bottom line. The goal is zero spills.” The judge said he regretted that he had agreed with prosecutors to keep secret the new communication system  but he stood by his decision to allow its use. He released his secret order  calling the wireless silver tablet a “teletype machine.” In granting the request  Colonel Cohen added another layer of secrecy to the at times remarkably opaque national security court at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba. Government censors black out portions of transcripts of public hearings before they are posted on the military commissions website  which is adorned with the motto  “Fairness Transparency Justice.” Witnesses from the prison  including lawyers and some commanders  testify anonymously. Soldiers strip their name tapes off their Army uniforms when on the courtroom premises. The judge and a court security officer can hit a mute button to silence the audio system that pipes the proceedings — on a 40-second delay — into the sealed-off observation room at the back of the courtroom where relatives of victims  journalists and other visitors watch. But the secrecy extends beyond the courtroom  which is at the heart of the hybrid federal-military justice system that the United States created in response to the Sept. 11  2001  attacks that killed nearly 3 000 people. All court filings  including a judge’s order  undergo a security review before the public can see it. By Defense Department regulation  court filings are to be released to the public within 15 business days. But they undergo a censorship scrub first  with representatives of a series of security agencies like the C.I.A.  F.B.I.  Guantánamo prison and the Pentagon’s United States Southern Command having a say on what portions of the filing are classified. But delays are common. It took 10 months from filing until the public could read a legal motion from May 2019 asking the Army judge in that case to hold a hearing on the question of granting time served credit for the torture endured by Majid Khan  who pleaded guilty to being a courier for Al Qaeda. Before Mr. Khan was brought to Guantánamo in 2006  the C.I.A. held him for three years in isolation and incognito in the C.I.A.’s secret prison network  the black sites. There  members of the medical staff “infused” a puréed meal into his rectum after he had gone on a hunger strike  an episode that itself was kept secret at the court until it was included in a declassified portion of a Senate study of the interrogation program. It is a matter of not only concealing information that is classified — for example the countries that hosted the black sites — but also blacking out words that the intelligence agencies say could create a mosaic of information that could let people discern government secrets. So a continent that was the location of a black site is also classified. Transcripts of public court sessions are also censored  with at times perplexing results. On Jan. 27  a defense lawyer questioning James E. Mitchell  the C.I.A. contractor who waterboarded prisoners in 2002 and 2003  read aloud a sentence from Dr. Mitchell’s 2016 memoir  “Enhanced Interrogation ” which was released with approval of the agency. In it  Dr. Mitchell  a psychologist  described the staffing of a black site this way: “There were also computer and communications geeks  analysts  targeters  subject matter experts  many  many agency police officers to act as security guards  two psychologists (counting me)  nurses  and a physician.” The transcript  released two weeks later  blacked out the words “agency police ” as though the C.I.A. had  on reconsideration  not wanted the world to know it used its own police force in the clandestine prison system. “The commissions are susceptible to it because they are captive to the agency ” said Joshua L. Dratel  a New York criminal defense lawyer who has handled dozens of federal national security cases and represented David Hicks  a prisoner at Guantánamo who went home to Australia in 2007 as part of plea deal in a conviction that was overturned in 2015. Mr. Dratel returned to the war court in February as an observer for the American Bar Association and spotted the court’s motto sewn into a carpet at the entrance. “You looking at the floor  there’s a rug that says ‘blah  blah  blah transparency ’ and then you look up and you see a soldier in front of you  another one  and they have their names taped over ” he said. “To me it’s just the dissonance of Gitmo.” In federal court in the United States  a defendant can choose to testify and tell his or her own story and let a judge or jury decide the truth of it. But at Guantánamo  Mr. Dratel said  even the detainee’s own story can be classified. Lawyers for the man accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  are forbidden from releasing the full details of his memories of his interrogations — he was waterboarded 183 times — because where they were done  and the identities of some of those who he believes carried them out  are classified. Defense lawyers in the Sept. 11 case were particularly outraged over the decision by Colonel Cohen  who abruptly announced in recent days that he was stepping down as the trial judge  to secretly allow prosecutors a direct channel of communication with the intelligence agencies from inside the court. In 2013  the C.I.A.  which was monitoring the proceedings from outside the courtroom  used the ability it had at the time to remotely mute the audio at a mention of the intelligence agency’s secret prison network. The judge at that time  Col. James L. Pohl  was furious. He ordered anybody with remote access to the court’s systems to unplug. Colonel Cohen’s decision to allow the intelligence agencies to communicate directly with prosecutors in the courtroom during the proceedings effectively restored that ability  albeit through a prosecutor who was reading warnings from the C.I.A. somewhere else and signaling the court security officer to cut the feed. Retroactive redaction is not unusual at the court. In last year’s motion in the Khan case  censors twice blacked out the name of President George W. Bush in an Amnesty International report from 2007 that recounted public remarks Mr. Bush had made in 2006. The rule-making can be random and constantly changes. In January  students  lawyers and human rights advocates who were at Guantánamo to observe a hearing were instructed that they were forbidden to talk about the Sept. 11 case outside the confines of Camp Justice  the crude housing area of tents and trailers at the razor-wire ringed court complex. Julia Hall  who works for Amnesty International  said she was discussing the case with other observers at O’Kelly’s  the base’s Irish pub  when a chaperone waved her hand in front of her mouth to silence her. The gag order was rescinded the next day. A new delegation of observers brought to the base the next week were given a new gag order: They were forbidden to talk about how many soldiers were inside the court guarding the defendants.

But Donald  the oldest son  knew something was wrong. “He’d known for a while ” Robert Kolker writes  ominously  toward the beginning of his fascinating and upsetting new book  “Hidden Valley Road.” There was the time when Donald  without explanation  stood at the sink and smashed 10 dishes to pieces. Another when he jumped straight into a bonfire. Another when he apparently killed a cat  “slowly and painfully.” Donald  who had the all-American good looks of his father  was descending into madness. And then  one by one  in a gruesome and chaotic parade  five of his nine brothers joined him. “Hidden Valley Road” tells the terrifying story of a family swallowed whole by schizophrenia  a disease that no one understood  not doctors or researchers  and certainly not the Galvins. Kolker carefully reconstructs the story of the household falling into bedlam as the strong  athletic brothers warred with their demons and one another in flights of violent rage  each one slipping further away. There was the Thanksgiving where the perfectly set table  Mimi’s last fingernail grip on normalcy  was completely toppled over in one of the brothers’ outbursts. The parents  ashamed and overwhelmed  tried to cope  while the other siblings searched for escape  secretly wondering if they would be the next to fall. Six sons with schizophrenia — the curse of the Galvin family is the stuff of Greek tragedy. Kolker tells their story with great compassion  burrowing inside the particular delusions and hospitalizations of each brother while chronicling the family’s increasingly desperate search for help. But “Hidden Valley Road” is more than a narrative of despair  and some of the most compelling chapters come from its other half  as a medical mystery. What clues  if any  might the Galvins’ misery hold for doctors and scientists trying to understand the roots of this unfathomable disease? The medical community’s long misunderstanding of schizophrenia is largely a story of relentless failure  every theory proving more misguided than the last. Some experts championed shock therapy  others called for institutionalization; some psychotherapists saw madness as a metaphor and some doctors prescribed catatonia by tranquilizers. Perhaps most troubling of all  a generation of psychotherapists blamed the mother for causing the disease by either overparenting or underparenting. (You want to stand up and applaud when Kolker quotes one psychiatrist’s rebuttal: “If bad parenting caused any of these diseases  we’d all be in big  big trouble.”) Through it all  the Galvins’ suffering is baroque and shattering. This is a world so bleak that serial incest rape — one of the ill brothers raped his two younger sisters for years — is just one of the horrors lurking in the attic. The story of the geneticists’ quest to understand the disease comes as a relief to the family’s anguish. And one researcher  Lynn DeLisi  whom we meet as a young mother in a decidedly male field  emerges as something of a hero. Years ahead of her time  DeLisi is convinced that schizophrenia is largely a genetic disease and through force of will  she seeks to make the case. The Galvin household  then  becomes one filled not only with pain  but perhaps with tantalizing clues as well. When she finally meets Mimi  halfway through the book  you are praying for a breakthrough. Kolker follows DeLisi and other researchers on their decades-long search for the disease’s genetic markers  following misadventures in research funding and mazes filled with dead ends. There are promising discoveries in experiments to detect familiar traits and identify the disease’s warning signs — complicated science that Kolker ably explains. If there were justice in the world  the Galvins’ genes would have provided the key to understanding and preventing schizophrenia  perhaps redeeming some measure of their pain. Unfortunately  science doesn’t indulge in narrative satisfaction. While the Galvins’ blood samples have proved central to important research into the genetics of the disease  DeLisi remains an outsider rather than a leader in the field  and the Galvins’ genes seem to hold no silver bullet  no Rosetta Stone. Indeed  the medical community appears not much closer today to finding a “cure” for schizophrenia  if such a thing exists. But Kolker argues that’s the wrong ship to wait for. More promising developments emerge in early detection  and in “soft intervention” techniques that combine therapy  family support and minimal medication. A gifted storyteller  Kolker brings each family member to life — there’s Michael  who found solace in a Tennessee hippie commune; Brian  who moved to California to become a rock star; Mary  who changed her name to Lindsay as soon as she got to boarding school. But he’s also able to widen the aperture  describing how mental illness reshapes the lives of everyone within sight. “For a family  schizophrenia is  primarily  a felt experience  as if the foundation of the family is permanently tilted in the direction of the sick family member ” Kolker writes. Kolker is used to prowling worlds of pain. His first book  “Lost Girls ” about the murders of prostitutes on Long Island  is filled with similar compassion without indulging in tawdry gore. He manages the same balancing act here  narrating the stuff of tabloid nightmares — one of the brothers kills himself and his ex-girlfriend with a .22-caliber rifle — without ever resorting to rubbernecking. Kolker is a restrained and unshowy writer who is able to effectively set a mood. As the walls begin closing in for the Galvins  he subtly recreates their feeling of claustrophobia  erasing the outside world that has offered so little help. The political tumult of the 1960s exists somewhere out there  but only as an aside: “They prayed for the president who died just a few weeks after their move to Hidden Valley Road  and they prayed for the president who had taken his place.” What are politics and presidents in the face of your sick children? Kolker spends several chapters with the two sisters  who responded in different ways to the trauma of their brother who preyed on them  and the other horrors of their lives. But it’s Mimi  the matriarch  who sticks with me. Toward the end of the book  she reflects on the chasm that nearly engulfed her and everyone she loved. Hearing her plain  stubborn  shellshocked voice  you can’t help wondering what defenses any of us could muster in the face of madness and monsters and genetic mysteries we may never understand. “I was crushed ” she says. “Because I thought I was such a good mother. I baked a cake and a pie every night. Or at least had Jell-O with whipped cream.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/books/review/05Dolnick-Cover/05Dolnick-Cover-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/jeff-schoep-white-nationalist-reformer.html, us, He Says His Nazi Days Are Over. Do You Believe Him?, , Jeff Schoep led America’s largest neo-Nazi group for two decades. He now says he wants to help destroy it. Jeff Schoep  the former leader of the National Socialist Movement  is a defendant in a lawsuit involving the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Va.  in 2017.Credit...Allison Farrand for The New York Times Supported by By John Eligon SAN BERNARDINO  Calif. — It was a panel discussion on a college campus about the importance of rejecting extremism. And one of the supposed experts on tolerance participating was Jeff Schoep  a man who once called the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville  Va.  “a glorious day for white solidarity in America.” At California State University  San Bernardino  in the fall  Mr. Schoep  who led America’s largest neo-Nazi organization for two and a half decades  shared that he had only recently renounced his racist views. The event was his first public appearance in the United States since making the announcement  and some members of the audience were skeptical. “It makes it unsatisfying to know that eight months to a year ago  you would have hated us ” Nicholas Flowers  a 22-year-old biracial student  told Mr. Schoep after the talk. Mr. Schoep is not the first racist in recent memory to renounce his former ways. Derek Black was a child star in the white power movement until he turned to speaking publicly against it. Joshua Bates posted a video of himself online burning his old neo-Nazi paraphernalia. Caleb Cain disavowed the alt-right movement on YouTube  the same medium that brought him in. And just this month  Matthew Heimbach  who worked alongside Mr. Schoep  announced publicly that he was leaving white nationalism — conveniently  skeptics say  while both he and Mr. Schoep face legal consequences for their roles in violence that broke out during the Charlottesville rally. Mr. Schoep  the former commander of the National Socialist Movement  may well have the highest profile among them. His announcement has generated heated discussion about the best way to defeat the resurgence of open bigotry tearing at the country’s social fabric. Some civil rights experts have said reformed neo-Nazis should use their outsize influence to draw others away from white nationalism. That is what Mr. Schoep says he wants to do  but what should the process of moving beyond his past look like? Mr. Schoep (pronounced “scoop”) and Mr. Heimbach are among more than two dozen defendants accused in a lawsuit of planning and carrying out the violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 that resulted in the murder of a counterprotester. A ruling against them could lead to significant financial penalties  among other consequences. “No matter if you reform after the fact  we live in a country of laws ” said Amy Spitalnick  the director of Integrity First for America  a nonprofit group underwriting the lawsuit. “Those who break those laws  those who violate people’s civil rights must be held accountable for it.” The plaintiffs filed a motion last month that raises questions about Mr. Schoep’s continued ties to the organization he said he has left. In a deposition  Burt Colucci  the new National Socialist Movement leader  said he still exchanged regular text messages with Mr. Schoep. In one exchange in October  Mr. Schoep warned Mr. Colucci that someone making threats against him may have been a federal informant trying to entrap him  according to the motion. Mr. Schoep said in an interview that Mr. Colucci had asked him if he knew anything about the threats  and he was simply assuring his former comrade that he had nothing to do with them. Critics say Mr. Schoep is simply trying escape legal liability  but he contends his new life has nothing to do with the lawsuits  and that he has put himself in danger by renouncing his former ways. Still  “when you’re America’s poster boy for Nazism for over two decades  that sticks ” said Brian Levin  the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University  San Bernardino. Some who have witnessed the racism that Mr. Schoep has promoted over the years wonder why he should be shown mercy and forgiveness when they have been made to suffer. “Why do black people have to go through so much to redeem themselves?” asked Tanesha Hudson  a social justice activist and filmmaker from Charlottesville who was protesting against the rally. “And yet  here he is  a white nationalist. It’s OK for him to do what he did then say he’s a changed man  and we’re supposed to be OK with that.” Mr. Schoep  46  recruited an untold number of people  including teenagers  into his organization. The National Socialist Movement  or N.S.M.  grew to 61 chapters in 35 states under Mr. Schoep  according to the Southern Poverty Law Center  a legal advocacy group. He told Mr. Flowers  the college student  that he knew for years that what he was doing was wrong. “It’s a process ” he said of his departure. “For about three years now  I knew better  but I was going through the motions. That’s what I did. Should I have kept going? No.” Heidi Beirich  the former director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center  said his decision to publicly renounce the N.S.M. was important  even if it is impossible to determine his sincerity. “I hope to God it’s sincere ” she said  “but it doesn’t hurt to have someone of his stature to say  ‘This movement is not for me  it’s bad.’” Those who doubt Mr. Schoep point to his past stunts. They say he tried to escape legal responsibility in the Charlottesville case by signing over control of the N.S.M. to a black man. The move backfired and upset his members so much that some have said he had little choice but to step down. Mike Schloar  who runs security for the N.S.M.  said he believed that Mr. Schoep left because of the Charlottesville lawsuit. “He led the largest white nationalist organization in the country and he just turns his back on it and tries to renounce it ” Mr. Schloar said. “To me  that’s a traitor.” At his red brick home just outside of Detroit  Mr. Schoep said that he was out of the N.S.M. for good and that his new goal was to persuade those he successfully lured into the white nationalist movement to follow him out. “I have that skill set where I brought all these people to the movement ” he said. “That skill set was put to the wrong use. I feel a sense of responsibility to do something meaningful to fix that.” He is also now a member of Parallel Networks  an anti-extremism organization co-founded by Jesse Morton  a former propagandist for Al Qaeda. And yet Mr. Schoep can be defensive about the extent of his own wrongdoing. Although he says he is a reformed man  symbols of hate surround him. He has an iron cross and an eagle tattooed to his forearms  two recognized hate symbols that he hesitates to acknowledge as such. He is also hesitant to get rid of a trove of old white nationalist albums and apparel that he owns. “One part of me wants to say  ‘Let’s do a big bonfire ’” he said  but that would feel like setting money ablaze. Molly Conger  an anti-fascist researcher and citizen journalist  said that Mr. Schoep should be working with law enforcement and activists to undermine the organization he helped grow  and not just speaking out against it. “You have to name names  you have to share intelligence  you have to disrupt what you’ve built ” said Ms. Conger  who lives in Charlottesville. “You have to tear the house down behind you on your way out.” Mr. Morton of Parallel Networks says that Mr. Schoep needs time. He has a yearslong journey ahead of him that requires transforming his worldview through intense self-examination. “He’s on his way to making those realizations ” Mr. Morton said. Mr. Schoep said he joined the National Socialist American Workers Freedom Movement  a neo-Nazi group founded in Minnesota by two former officials of the American Nazi Party  when he was 18 years old. By 21  he became the group’s commander and rebranded it as the N.S.M.  its original name. There was no grand epiphany that led him to what he is doing now  Mr. Schoep said. Rather  it was small things here and there — a black man who helped him fix his car  a Jewish woman who invited him into her home. “Imagine waking up every day and being pissed off at the world. ‘Oh  the Jews are holding us down ’ or ‘the blacks are holding us down ’” he said. “You just become distrusting of everything. It’s a really negative way to live.” Deeyah Khan  a London-based filmmaker who is Muslim  said Mr. Schoep’s veneer appeared to be cracking the first time she interviewed him in 2017 for “White Right: Meeting the Enemy ” her documentary about the rise of white nationalism. Ms. Khan ended up going to Charlottesville with Mr. Schoep for the rally. To her surprise  she said  he was protective of her and made sure his followers treated her with respect. After spending many hours with him  she said  she came away believing he was “utterly misguided” but would eventually break with his hateful allies. Christian Picciolini  a former white extremist who has been working to disengage people from the movement for two decades  counseled Mr. Schoep before he publicly left the N.S.M. Mr. Schoep appeared on Mr. Picciolini’s television series “Breaking Hate” on MSNBC last year. The two have since had a falling out. Mr. Picciolini said he believed that Mr. Schoep was diving too quickly into intervention work without taking the proper steps to understand his own issues — that he needed to see a therapist and go into the communities he targeted  listen to the people he hurt and ask for forgiveness. “I’ve seen people trying to disengage who haven’t done the work and try to outrun their past  fall into something else ” Mr. Picciolini said. “I think he’s not interested in paying the price for having been in the movement.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/30/us/00EX-NAZI1/merlin_164338722_3a6da9cb-f4ab-428a-8192-d028475da2a8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/30/us/00EX-NAZI2/merlin_146644212_56673839-6c6d-452f-82e7-2a280740f2e7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-death-toll.html, nyregion, Coronavirus in N.Y.: Toll Soars to Nearly 3 000 as State Pleads for Aid, “It is hard to put fully into words what we are all grappling with as we navigate our way through this pandemic ” a hospital official said., Supported by “It is hard to put fully into words what we are all grappling with as we navigate our way through this pandemic ” a hospital official said. By Alan Feuer New York  the increasingly battered epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus outbreak  on Friday reported its highest number of deaths in a single day  prompting state officials to beg the rest of the United States for assistance and to enact an emergency order designed to stave off medical catastrophe. In the 24 hours through 12 a.m. on Friday  562 people — or one almost every two-and-a-half minutes — died from the virus in New York State  bringing the total death toll to nearly 3 000  double what it was only three days before. In the same period  1 427 newly sickened patients poured into the hospitals — another one-day high — although the rate of increase in hospitalizations seemed to stabilize  suggesting that the extreme social-distancing measures put in place last month may have started working. Despite the glimmer of hope  the new statistics were a stark reminder of the gale-force strength of the crisis that is threatening New York  where more than 102 000 people — nearly as many as in Italy and Spain  the hardest-hit European countries — have now tested positive for the virus. The situation  as it has been for weeks  was particularly dire in New York City  where some hospitals have reported running out of body bags and others have begun to plan for the unthinkable prospect of rationing care. “It is hard to put fully into words what we are all grappling with as we navigate our way through this pandemic ” Vicki L. LoPachin  the chief medical officer of the Mount Sinai Health System  wrote in an email to the staff on Friday. “We are healing so many and comforting those we can’t save — one precious life at a time.” Around the country  the total number of coronavirus cases spiked sharply as of Friday afternoon  exceeding 275 000  with more than 7 000 total deaths. After New York  New Jersey was the state with the highest rate of infection. Globally  more than one million people had been infected and nearly 60 000 had died. Hot spots continued to emerge. “We continue to watch  in addition  the Chicago area  the Detroit area  and have developing concerns around Colorado  the District of Columbia ” Dr. Deborah Birx  the White House coronavirus response coordinator  said at a daily news briefing on Friday. She added that the government would “move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the front line health care providers but also every American who needs our support right now.” As the inexorable march of contagion in New York continued  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued an impassioned plea to the nation to hurry medical staff and equipment to the state before an expected shortfall of both overwhelmed its already groaning health care system  perhaps as early as next week. Mr. Cuomo  vowing to return the favor  said he would redirect hundreds of lifesaving ventilators and teams of local doctors to other states as soon as the crisis in New York passed its peak. But unable to count on reinforcements arriving fast enough  Mr. Cuomo also issued an extraordinary executive order on Friday giving him the power to commandeer ventilators from hospitals in less-affected counties in the state and to redeploy them to hard hit areas in Brooklyn  Queens and Long Island. “I’m not going to let people die because we didn’t redistribute ventilators ” Mr. Cuomo said  adding  “We don’t have enough — period.” But Representative Elise Stefanik  a Republican congresswoman who represents a rural district of northern New York  said in a statement that she was “very concerned” about the order. “I represent demographically the largest number of seniors of any district in New York ” she wrote. “This is the most vulnerable age group facing Covid-19 and needs to be considered.” She and 11 other state and federal Republican officials later issued a joint statement opposing Mr. Cuomo’s action. As the outbreak entered its second month  New York City in particular hunkered down for what promised to be a long and grueling siege. Earlier in the week  city officials rushed 45 refrigerated trailers to overburdened hospitals where in-house morgues were filling up with bodies. Crematories  under eased restrictions  are now allowed to run around the clock. A special team of 42 military mortuary affairs officers was starting to arrive from Virginia to help the city’s medical examiner. One out of every six police officers in the city had called out sick or was in quarantine  straining the department at the very moment when its 36 000 officers have been asked to enforce new rules intended to slow the spread of infection. To cut back on crowding in emergency rooms  the city’s Fire Department issued new guidelines to thousands of paramedics  telling them not to bring cardiac patients to hospitals unless they were able to find a pulse. Mayor Bill de Blasio has been warning that the city was only days away from what he called a “D-Day ” when the outbreak would overwhelm the health care system  putting hundreds  if not thousands  of additional people at risk. In an early morning television appearance on Friday  he made his own appeal to the country  asking for what amounted to a draft for medical personnel. “Unless there is a national effort to enlist doctors  nurses  hospital workers of all kinds and get them where they are needed most in the country in time  I don’t see  honestly  how we’re going to have the professionals we need to get through this crisis ” Mr. de Blasio said. As the weekend neared  the possibility emerged that the city could finally get relief from the U.S.N.S. Comfort  the Navy hospital ship that arrived in New York to great fanfare on Monday. Pentagon officials had initially said the ship would treat only non-coronavirus patients in an effort to keep the vessel free from infection. But on Friday  Gen. Mark A. Milley  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  said the military was “reassessing” its policy and might allow coronavirus patients aboard the ship. General Milley’s comments came after New York hospital executives complained on Thursday that the Comfort was sitting at its berth in New York largely empty while hospitals in the city were overrun. In one sign of the strain on hospitals  Lenox Hill Medical Center in Manhattan temporarily experienced a drop in pressure in its oxygen supply on Friday  according to a memo that hospital executives sent to staff members. The cause was apparently the heavy demand. To bolster the local health care system  Mr. Cuomo this week enacted an unprecedented plan for all of New York’s hospitals — public and private  upstate and downstate — to work together in a kind of single network. By the end of the week  there were early signs that the effort was working. On Thursday  Woodhull Medical Center  a public hospital in Brooklyn  reached its capacity for treating virus patients and transferred 15 to the Bellevue Medical Center  a public hospital in Manhattan  said Dr. Robert Chin  Woodhull’s emergency department director. “So far  we’ve been holding it together ” Dr. Chin said. “Are we ready for what’s coming? I can’t really say — because I don’t know what’s coming.” Jesse McKinley  William K. Rashbaum  Matt Richtel  Brian Rosenthal  Michael Rothfeld and Ali Watkins contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/nyregion/04nyvirus-ledeall1/04nyvirus-ledeall1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-white-house-face-masks.html, us politics, A Debate Over Masks Uncovers Deep White House Divisions, The Trump administration remains deeply divided over whether to tell all Americans to cover their faces in public to stop the spread of coronavirus., Supported by The Trump administration remains deeply divided over whether to tell all Americans to cover their faces in public to stop the spread of coronavirus. By Michael D. Shear and Sheila Kaplan WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was urging all Americans to wear a mask when they leave their homes  but he immediately undercut the message by repeatedly calling the recommendation voluntary and promising that he would not wear one himself. “With the masks  it is going to be really a voluntary thing ” the president said at the beginning of the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I am choosing not to do it. But some people may want to do it  and that’s OK. It may be good. Probably will — they’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation  it’s voluntary.” “Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents  prime ministers  dictators  kings  queens — I don’t know ” he added. “Somehow  I don’t see it for myself.” Mr. Trump’s announcement  followed by his quick dismissal  was a remarkable public display of the intense debate that has played out inside the West Wing over the past several days as a divided administration argued about whether to request such a drastic change in Americans’ social behavior. Dr. Steven Choi  the chief quality officer and associate dean at Yale New Haven Health System and Yale University School of Medicine  said the president’s behavior at the briefing contributed to confusion among health care workers and regular Americans. “For anyone  particularly the president of the United States  to ignore recommendations from the C.D.C. is not only irresponsible but selfish ” Dr. Choi said. The president’s remarks came during a particularly contentious briefing where Mr. Trump insulted reporters  jousted with members of his own administration and returned to pugilistic form after several days in which he appeared to grasp the grim implications of a virus that could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. Mr. Trump again dismissed the recommendation of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  for a national stay-at-home order  saying he would leave such demands to the governors. But he did say that the federal government would pay hospitals to treat coronavirus patients  instead of allowing people to buy heavily subsidized insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges  as many Democrats have urged. The mask debate has played out in public and in private. Mr. Trump said Americans who choose to comply with the C.D.C.’s recommendation should use a basic cloth or face mask  not medical- or surgical-grade masks that are used by hospital workers and emergency workers. He also said people must still follow social distancing guidelines  which he called the “safest way to avoid the infection.” Senior officials at the C.D.C. have been pushing the president for days to advise everyone — even people who appear to be healthy — to wear a mask or a scarf that covers their mouth and nose when shopping at the grocery store or while in other public places. The embrace of such a policy would be one of the most visible alterations to social habits in the United States in the face of a pandemic that has infected more than a million people around the globe and killed nearly 60 000 — a physical manifestation of fear that has gripped millions of Americans. The issue became more urgent after the C.D.C.’s director  Dr. Robert R. Redfield  said that as many as a quarter of those already infected may show no symptoms but still contribute to “significant” transmission. Local officials in New York and Los Angeles have already called for people to cover their faces in public. On Friday  the governor of Pennsylvania called on his state’s residents to wear masks when they go out. The surgeon general  Jerome M. Adams  stood next to the president Friday and urged Americans to comply. “The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity  for example coughing  speaking or sneezing  even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms ” Dr. Adams said. “In light of this new evidence  the C.D.C. recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult.” But some White House officials have resisted and Mr. Trump on Friday time and again said it was voluntary. Matthew Pottinger  the deputy national security adviser  who has been wearing a mask during meetings in the White House  has shown people studies that advocate the wide use of masks  one official said. Other officials believed that was excessive. One top C.D.C. official who has seen emails from people in the West Wing said that some of Mr. Trump’s advisers were pressing him to recommend mask wearing only in “areas of widespread transmission.” That worried C.D.C. officials because the virus has already spread  largely undetected to most parts of the country. Wearing masks or other face coverings everywhere  including in places where there are few reported cases  will help slow the rate of infection  they believe. The result was been a policy stalemate that played out on live television. Dr. Deborah L. Birx  the coordinator of the White House coronavirus response  expressed serious reservations on Thursday  saying that asking all Americans to wear masks could inadvertently signal that Americans can abandon social distancing and return to public life as long as they wear a mask. “We don’t want people to feel like  ‘Oh  I’m wearing a mask. I’m protected and I’m protecting others ’” Dr. Birx said at the daily briefing. Others at the White House have expressed worry that asking all Americans to wear masks could heighten shortages for doctors  nurses and emergency workers  even if they urge people not to seek the highly protective  and scarce  N95 masks used by hospital staff. Dr. Fauci said in an interview on CNN this week that “you don’t want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected.” Hospitals across the country are running out of N95 masks  which filter at least 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. In a move to increase the availability of the masks  the Food and Drug Administration said Friday it would allow use of a Chinese equivalent. Skeptics inside the administration also raised doubts about whether people in the United States would ever feel comfortable wearing masks in public  noting that the cultural norms are different in America from some Asian countries  where the use of masks became more common after previous outbreaks. Some conservatives have said they did not believe that Americans would ever accept wide usage. Michael Dougherty  a conservative writer at National Review  wrote that Americans would “quickly feel that masks are ridiculous  menacing  or an imposition on life  then conclude they must be temporary.” Mr. Trump’s personal hesitance also underscored questions about whether other politicians or media personalities would choose to wear masks while appearing in public. Outside of the White House  the move toward masks accelerated quickly this week. On Friday  after Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania  a Democrat  urged residents of his state to wear masks if they ventured out of their homes  the state’s health secretary reiterated that staying at home — away from groups of people — remained the most effective way to ensure that the virus would not spread. “A mask isn’t a pass to go back to work  or go visit friends  or go socialize ” said the health secretary  Dr. Rachel Levine. At the World Health Organization briefing on Friday  Dr. Michael J. Ryan  the executive director of the health emergency program  said that while the W.H.O. still recommended masks only for front-line health workers and those who are sick or caring for someone who is  “we can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks  both homemade or cloth masks  at community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease.” Senator Patrick J. Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  has been one of the most vocal supporters of wearing masks. In an interview from the basement of his home  where he is isolating because of his recent contact with lawmakers who tested positive for the virus  he said wearing masks would help limit the effect of it. “It just makes sense to have some kind of physical barrier that would reduce the droplets that are released when people speak and breathe ” Mr. Toomey said. “The idea is to protect everyone else. My mask protects you. Your mask protects me.” Mr. Toomey said he spoke with Mr. Trump on Wednesday to urge him to recommend masks for everyone. He said the president seemed “very sympathetic” to the idea but did not reveal his course. “He did acknowledge that it was under very serious consideration and the subject of fairly intense discussion among his team ” Mr. Toomey said. He said it was “premature” to conclude that Americans would not wear masks. “Who’s to say that people won’t respond in a way that this becomes acceptable and normal?” he asked. Evidence arguing for the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus continues to mount. A study published Friday in the journal Nature found that flat surgical face masks significantly reduced the number of virus-carrying droplets that mask wearers released into the surrounding air. Although the study did not look at the new coronavirus  researchers based their analysis on closely related seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold and are similar in size to the virus that causes the disease Covid-19. They also looked at influenza viruses and rhinoviruses that typically spread in winter. The researchers asked 246 people with suspected respiratory viral infections to breathe into a machine for 30 minutes to measure the amount of virus they exhaled. Half of the participants wore a face mask  while the other half performed the experiment without any face covering. Among 111 people whose infections were later confirmed with a lab test  masks stopped the spread of all seasonal coronavirus and more than 70 percent of influenza virus infections  the study showed. Masks were not as effective in reducing transmission of rhinoviruses  or the common cold. For the current coronavirus pandemic  all health officials  including those at the W.H.O. and C.D.C.  agree that masks should be worn by anyone with symptoms like a cough or fever  and anyone caring for someone with a confirmed or suspected case. Maggie Haberman and Knvul Sheikh contributed reporting from New York. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/us/politics/03dc-virus-masks1/merlin_171051747_458b22b4-79f6-4b9d-a405-ce94db4d494d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/business/sba-loans-coronavirus.html, business, Frenzy and Desperation as Small Businesses Grab for Government Aid, A $349 billion program to throw them a financial lifeline got off to a rocky start on Friday as the U.S. economy continued to seize up., Supported by A $349 billion program to throw them a financial lifeline got off to a rocky start on Friday as the U.S. economy continued to seize up. By Stacy Cowley and Emily Flitter [Read our Coronavirus Relief Small Business F.A.Q.] The frenzy began even before most banks opened. By 9 a.m. on Friday  banks had already processed 700 loans totaling $2.5 million for small businesses as the spigot opened on a federal emergency relief program. But that was just the beginning. By early afternoon that number had ballooned to $1.8 billion. And by evening it was $3.2 billion in loans that will go to more than 10 000 small businesses desperate to save themselves. It was all part of a scramble by small businesses around the country to stay alive by grabbing a piece of a Treasury Department program to pump $349 billion into the sputtering U.S. economy. Small businesses  which employ nearly half of America’s private-sector workers  are hemorrhaging  and the loans are meant to help them retain employees or rehire those they let go because of the coronavirus pandemic. But business owners found that applying for the money was harder than they had anticipated. Lenders had received guidance from the Treasury Department only the night before  just hours before they were to start making loans. On top of that  banks imposed their own rules on which businesses could and couldn’t borrow. And many lenders  including JPMorgan Chase  the nation’s largest  didn’t have their websites ready for borrowers until later Friday. For small-business owners  many of whom have run out of cash to pay salaries and rent  time was everything. Fearful that the money will run out — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the loans would be on a first-come  first-served basis — they flooded banks with calls and emails as they tried to get to the front of the line. “I’ve been up all night ” said Jeremy Resnick of Jacksonville  Fla.  who runs several businesses  including a real estate brokerage and a chain of ice cream stores. “They put out these rays of hope for people  and the reality behind it isn’t there.” The frenzy played out against the backdrop of yet another grim unemployment report. On Friday  the Labor Department said employers shed 701 000 jobs last month — the biggest monthly drop in more than a decade  ending a landmark 113 months of job creation. And nearly 10 million people applied for unemployment benefits over the previous two weeks. Some of their former employers view the relief program  called the Paycheck Protection Program  as a potential lifeline. Companies with fewer than 500 workers have slashed millions of jobs in recent weeks as restaurants  bars  retailers and other Main Street businesses across the country were ordered to shut their doors. The program offers such companies loans of up to $10 million  which can be forgiven if the business uses the money to retain workers for eight weeks or rehire for positions it cuts in the wake of the pandemic. The Small Business Administration is backing the loans  but customers must apply through banks or other lenders. Bank of America was the first big bank to begin taking applications  and it had around 10 000 by early Friday  Brian Moynihan  the bank’s chief executive  said on CNBC. By evening  its loan requests totaled $22 billion  a spokesman said. But many Bank of America customers were dismayed to find that the lender would not work with them because they had only accounts  and not loans  with the bank. The bank said it was accepting applications only from customers who had both “a pre-existing business lending and business deposit relationship” as of Feb. 15. That eliminated Tamara Alexander and her business in Houston  which provides behavioral therapy for children with autism. With 13 employees  Ms. Alexander is struggling to stay afloat with just a trickle of clients who can connect over video chat. She went to her Bank of America branch Friday morning with high hopes. But although her banker had assured her the day before that she could get a loan  she was told that only those with an existing loan or credit card would be eligible. “We kind of bootstrapped our way to our business — thankfully we haven’t needed to acquire any debt ” Ms. Alexander said. “The one bit of help we need  we can’t get. And coming from our own bank  it’s just so stressful.” Dean Athanasia  the head of Bank of America’s consumer and small business group  sent a memo to employees on Friday pledging to “enhance” the program soon “to accommodate more and more of our small-business clients.” But even customers with previous loans were struggling. Melissa Perri  who runs a software consulting firm  ProdUX Labs  in New York that employs six people  has for years had a business bank account and a $42 000 line of credit with Bank of America  she said. But when she tried to apply on Friday  she got a message that said she was denied because she didn’t have a credit card. “I was pretty frustrated ” she said. “I said: ‘I have multiple accounts with you  and I’ve been banking with you for years. How is this possible?’” Bank of America said on its website that a “business credit card  line of credit or loan” would all qualify. That should have made Ms. Perri eligible. A spokesman said the bank would look into her case. Other large banks imposed similar requirements. JPMorgan Chase said it would take applications only from people who had a business checking account with the bank as of Feb. 15. A notice on Wells Fargo’s website said it  too  required an existing business checking account. Citi has not yet announced its rules; a spokesman said it was reviewing the program’s rules and planned to start accepting applications “as soon as possible.” Hundreds of business owners complained on Twitter that they were ineligible for their bank’s program or that it had not yet started accepting applications. The National Federation of Independent Business said many feared they would be shut out of the aid effort. “This has the potential to be the last straw for many small businesses and their employees ” it said. Adding to the pressure: Many expect the program’s $349 billion lending pool to run out unless Congress allocates more money. “If we run out of money  we’re going to go back to Congress and get more money for small business ” Mr. Mnuchin said on the Fox Business Network on Friday. The Treasury Department had hoped to bring nonbank lenders into the program  but as of Friday  the government had not even released an application that would let financial technology companies apply to participate  industry executives said. Stephen D. Steinour  the chief executive of Huntington Bank  a lender in Columbus  Ohio  said his staff had worked all night to get the bank’s website ready to start taking applications online by late Friday afternoon. Mr. Mnuchin said banks would be able to approve applications and send borrowers money “the same day.” Mr. Steinour said he thought a same-day turnaround would be possible in a few weeks  but not immediately. He expects to have his bank’s first batch of approvals — and borrowers’ checks — ready by early next week. Lenders struggled with operational issues throughout Friday. Chase’s website for the program returned error messages at times in the morning  leading many aspiring applicants to assume it was overwhelmed with traffic. A Chase spokeswoman said that the site had not crashed and that it was taken offline for updates. The bank started accepting loan requests shortly after 1 p.m. One would-be borrower was Anne Lanier. She and her husband had been working the phones since Thursday looking for a bank to lend them $11 000 to keep paying the five employees of their Brooklyn bar  Black Rabbit  which closed on March 16. Without immediate help  the couple will be out of business. But the last time they borrowed money for the bar was 13 years ago  from a local bank that has long since discarded the paperwork. Lenders that Ms. Lanier found on the S.B.A.’s website said they were dealing only with existing customers. The couple turned to Chase  which provides them a business checking account. On Friday afternoon  they submitted a preliminary loan request with their business name  tax identification number and contact information  and received a message saying a Chase representative would contact them. At the time of this article’s publication  they were still waiting. Some of the features that were supposed to make it easier for banks to quickly ramp up lending through the program may actually make it harder for people who need the money to get it. Participating banks are protected from liability for some things that regulators would normally punish them for  like not performing a thorough-enough background check on a borrower who later turns out to be a criminal. But they aren’t completely exempt from having to look into customers’ profiles  and one way they can avoid having to do too much extra paperwork is to lend only to existing customers. That barrier is causing problems for small businesses that have not borrowed money recently. It is an even bigger problem for minority-owned businesses  which struggle even in good times to get banks to lend to them. “Small-business lending already has a discrimination problem ” said Amanda Fischer  the policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Another fear is that the program will be overrun by fundamentally healthy businesses eager to have the government cover up to two months of their payroll costs. Borrowers don’t have to document a hardship like a sharp sales drop; they simply have to affirm that “current economic uncertainty” makes the aid necessary to support their “ongoing operations.” Despite the paycheck program’s chaotic start  Mr. Steinour of Huntington Bank said he hoped it would play a vital role in salvaging tens of thousands of businesses that would otherwise collapse. “This is an extraordinary program  and to have it all put together in a week was a phenomenal  around-the-clock effort ” he said.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html, world asia, China Pushes for Quiet Burials as Coronavirus Death Toll Is Questioned, Officials are trying to curb expressions of grief and control the narrative amid doubts about the official number of deaths in China., Supported by Officials are trying to curb expressions of grief and control the narrative amid doubts about the official number of deaths in China. By Amy Qin and Cao Li Liu Pei’en held the small wooden box that contained his father’s remains. Only two months ago  he had helplessly clutched his father’s frail hand as the elderly man took his last breath  and the pain was still raw. He wept. But there was little time  or space  for Mr. Liu to grieve. He said officials in the central Chinese city of Wuhan had insisted on accompanying him to the funeral home and were waiting anxiously nearby. Later  they followed him to the cemetery where they watched him bury his father  he said. Mr. Liu saw one of his minders taking photos of the funeral  which was over in 20 minutes. “My father devoted his whole life to serving the country and the party ” Mr. Liu  44  who works in finance  said by phone. “Only to be surveilled after his death.” For months  the residents of Wuhan had been told they could not pick up the ashes of their loved ones who had died during the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak. Now that the authorities say the epidemic is under control  officials are pushing the relatives to bury the dead quickly and quietly  and they are suppressing online discussion of fatalities as doubts emerge about the true size of the toll. China’s official death toll from the coronavirus stood at 3 322 on Friday  but medical workers and others have suggested the count should be higher. The C.I.A. has warned the White House for weeks that China vastly understated its epidemic  current and former American intelligence officials say. As China tries to control the narrative  the police in Wuhan  where the pandemic began  have been dispatched to break up groups on WeChat  a popular messaging app  set up by the relatives of coronavirus victims. Government censors have scrubbed images circulating on social media showing relatives in the city lining up at funeral homes to collect ashes. Officials have assigned minders to relatives like Mr. Liu  to follow them as they pick burial plots  claim their loved ones’ remains and bury them  grieving family members say. “Where is the dignity after death?” Mr. Liu asked. “Where is the humanity?” The ruling Communist Party says it is trying to prevent large gatherings from causing a new outbreak. But its tight controls appear to be part of a concerted attempt to avoid an outpouring of anguish and anger that could be a visceral reminder of its early missteps and efforts to conceal the outbreak. Those same public displays or discussions of loss could also feed skepticism over how China has counted the dead. Wuhan accounted for nearly two-thirds of China’s total infections and more than three-quarters of its deaths. But in the early weeks of the outbreak  medical workers said many deaths from the coronavirus weren’t counted because of a shortage of test kits. More recently  a truck driver cited in a report by Caixin  an influential newsmagazine  talked about dropping off thousands of boxes for storing ashes at Hankou Funeral Home  one of eight funeral homes in the city. While the numbers raised doubts about the death toll  it was unclear whether the boxes were used for just coronavirus victims or more broadly. The Chinese government says it has been open and transparent about the scale of the outbreak within its borders. But the party also wants to closely orchestrate how the epidemic’s victims should be mourned and remembered. It is portraying them as martyrs and compatriots who gave their lives in the fight against the spread of the disease  rather than victims of an outbreak. The government held a nationwide day of mourning on Saturday  the day of the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival  a time for honoring ancestors. Entertainment activities stopped  flags flew at half-staff  and alarms and horns sounded for three minutes starting at 10 a.m. The official mourning will probably not be enough to soothe many families in Wuhan who have chafed against the state’s efforts to assert control over the grieving process. Some have demanded justice and accountability from the government  hoping that their loved ones did not die in vain. The government fired two top local officials in February  presumably over the bungling of the initial response  but it has not said if it would conduct further investigations. “I demand an explanation ” said Zhang Hai  a 50-year-old native of Wuhan whose father  Zhang Lifa  died after he was infected with the coronavirus in a hospital. He wants to know why it took officials weeks to inform the public that the virus could spread among humans. “Otherwise  I can’t give my father closure and I will never be at peace.” Other residents have tried to find their own way to privately memorialize their loved ones with small  makeshift acts of remembrance. Maria Ma  a 23-year-old design teacher at a college in Wuhan  knew that her grandfather would have wanted the family to hold a wake for him in a large tent in which relatives could keep vigil and friends could burn incense. But when he and Ms. Ma’s grandmother died in January  his wish couldn’t be met. Instead  their bodies were quickly taken away and cremated. With Wuhan under lockdown  Ms. Ma and her family had no choice but to make do with simple rituals at home. They burned “spirit money ” wads of paper printed to look like currency  following the custom of ensuring that loved ones have enough to spend in the afterlife. On the 49th day after her grandfather’s death  the men in Ms. Ma’s family cut their hair  also in line with tradition. Still  she said  the family was racked with guilt over not being able to organize a proper funeral. “We keep asking ourselves  ‘How could this have happened to our family?’” Ms. Ma said by phone. “We are just ordinary people. We never did anything bad to anyone.” In recent days  as the official number of new cases in China has dwindled  the authorities in Wuhan have turned to dealing with deaths. Officials have paid families about $420 for each relative who died during the epidemic  regardless of the cause. Relatives of coronavirus victims are also entitled to a 30 percent discount on burial plots and free cremation services. Some  like Peng Bangwen  are finding that the monetary support doesn’t address the stigma of the virus that extends even after death. Mr. Peng wants to bury his father  Peng Andong  who died in early February  in the family’s ancestral home outside of Wuhan. But village officials rejected the idea  saying they didn’t want the remains of a coronavirus patient there. “Whether it’s with a quiet and peaceful funeral  or a grand and ornate funeral  I just want to have it taken care of ” Mr. Peng  32  who works at a hotel in Wuhan  said by phone. “Otherwise it is too cruel  both for me and for him.” Others  like Mr. Liu  the finance worker who buried his father  are struggling to come to terms with their loss. His father  Liu Ouqing  was a respected member of the Communist Party who had led a distinguished life as a civil servant and college administrator and had started enjoying retirement only in recent years. The father and son had grown closer  and the elder Mr. Liu doted on his 11-year-old granddaughter. In January  the elder Mr. Liu had gone to a hospital in Wuhan for a regular checkup. There  he became infected with the coronavirus. His son  who had sneaked into the hospital by pretending to be a patient  said Mr. Liu fought valiantly but knew his end was near. His father told him to look in the bedside drawer  where he had kept notes on his finances and recipes for his granddaughter’s favorite dishes. On Jan. 29  he died  with his son by his side. Mr. Liu  devastated  sought out a Buddhist priest  who conducted a ritual in a temple to monitor the state of his father’s soul. On some nights  Mr. Liu quietly read Buddhist prayers for his father. Late last month  he received a call from the authorities notifying him to prepare for the burial. Mr. Liu was assigned two officials  one from his father’s workplace and the other a local neighborhood worker  who said they were there to provide support. Last week  they went with him to Biandanshan Cemetery  in the city’s southwest. He chose the most expensive option  a south-facing plot that had mountains behind it and a lake below. It cost $14 000. They held the funeral two days later. A label had been affixed to his father’s blank headstone noting the grave’s location: Row 24  Number 19. The tombstone would come later. “Like a house without a door ” Mr. Liu said. With a marker  he wrote his father’s name at the top of the headstone. When the burial was over  the officials asked the family to sign a form indicating that they had completed their assignment. Two days later  Mr. Liu returned to the cemetery. This time  he went alone and spent an hour at his father’s grave. “Wait for me and Mom ” he told his father. “One day we will all live together in your new home.” Mr. Liu said he would not stop pressing the government to punish the local officials responsible for initially concealing the outbreak and to provide fair compensation to the families of the victims. “They think that I’ll go away now just because I’ve completed the burial?” he said. “No. I’m not finished yet.” Yiwei Wang and Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing.

McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/world/03virus-china-grief-top/merlin_171152772_7620058c-5b74-4026-b320-f37462f080fd-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/multimedia/author-amy-qin/author-amy-qin-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-cao-li/author-cao-li-thumbLarge.png

By Sarah Mervosh and Jack Healy A surge in coronavirus deaths in the United States has prompted the vast majority of governors to order their residents to stay home  but a small number of states are resisting increasingly urgent calls to shut down. The pressure on the holdouts in the Midwest and the South has mounted in recent days as fellow governors  public-health experts and even their own citizens urge them to adopt tougher measures that have been put in place across 41 states and Washington  D.C. Health experts warn that the coronavirus can easily exploit any gaps in a state-by-state patchwork of social distancing in the country  where the death toll climbed past 6 600 on Friday. “I just don’t understand why we’re not doing that ” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases  said on CNN. “We really should be.” By Friday  nine states had yet to issue formal statewide stay-at-home orders. It is the most direct  stringent measure available  going beyond closing down restaurants and schools and instructing all residents to stay at home  except for necessities. In some of those states  cities and counties had stepped in to issue their own orders  leaving a patchwork of restrictions. The contrast is the starkest in five states — Arkansas  Iowa  Nebraska  North Dakota and South Dakota — where there are no such orders in place  either in major cities or statewide. Another four had partial restrictions issued locally in certain cities or counties. In an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus  a vast majority of states and the Navajo Nation have given directives  affecting about nine in 10 U.S. residents. In interviews and at news conferences this week  the governors in the holdout states defended their decision  saying that they had already taken strong steps — closing schools  and shutting down or limiting many aspects of public life  including restaurants  bars  gyms  bowling alleys and movie theaters. “I can’t lock the state down ” said Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa  which has recorded more than 600 confirmed cases and at least 11 deaths. “People also have to be responsible for themselves.” For many conservative governors who believe strongly in small government and personal responsibility  the prospect of mandatory stay-at-home orders is anathema and they rejected what they called a catchall approach that could wreck their states’ economies. Though governors issuing the orders elsewhere have spanned the political spectrum  with some Republican governors emerging as early and strong advocates  the remaining holdout states are all Republican-led. Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota said he was appealing to residents “who love liberty and freedom” to respect social-distancing rules. “It’s important that we exercise individual responsibility ” he said at a news conference. “By following these guidelines  we’re literally saving lives.” Some holdout governors have issued different levels of restrictions within their states. Iowa has adopted a point system to determine whether particular parts of the state should be ordered to shelter in place. In Nebraska  restaurants in more rural areas were still open for customers to eat-in — as long as there were fewer than 10 at a time. Other states with partial restrictions in cities or counties  but no statewide orders  included Oklahoma  South Carolina  Utah and Wyoming. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas had previously toughened social-distancing guidelines  but stopped short of calling the move a statewide stay-at-home order; on Friday  a spokesman clarified that Texas was indeed under a statewide mandate. Also on Friday  the governors of Missouri and Alabama  who had previously resisted such a move  also issued stay-at-home orders. “Some will naturally say  why did you wait so long?” Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama said. “Others will say  why now?” She said she had sought balanced measures that “would look out for people’s safety while keeping government from choking the life out of business and commerce.” In many of the holdout states — largely rural  with far fewer cases than the hardest-hit regions like New York City — residents said they were already social distancing  even without formal orders. Still  some feared the lack of clear instructions could leave dangerous gaps. “If we don’t get some clear directive from our governor  people will begin to rationalize reasons for getting together: ‘It’s not that bad. I see them anyway at the store ’” said Nancy DeBoer  a nurse in Brookings  S.D.  home to South Dakota State University. “It’s our governor’s responsibility to show some leadership.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said in an interview that the typical stay-at-home order was a misleading “illusion” because it includes so many exemptions allowing people to go out in public  such as for groceries or exercise. He said Arkansas had taken “very aggressive measures ” and said ordering people to stay at home would simply leave thousands jobless. “If I signed it today  more than 700 000 people would get up and go to work tomorrow ” he said  adding another 100 000 would be suddenly unemployed. The different approaches have created a rift between states  angering other governors and residents living under stricter orders just across state lines. A Tennessee congressman wrote the governor of Arkansas asking for a stay-at-home order so that the virus did not spread next door. “What are you waiting for?” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California  who issued the first statewide order last month  told CNN when asked about governors who have not followed suit. “What more evidence do you need? If you think it’s not going to happen to you  there are many proof points all across this country.” People demanding tougher measures are barraging elected officials with phone calls and social-media messages. A doctor in Iowa and a registered nurse in South Dakota have started online petitions. In Nebraska  the Facebook page of Gov. Pete Ricketts is filled with commenters second-guessing his decision. “PLEASE issue a stay at home order!” one person wrote. “Very soon it is going to be too late!!” “We’ve got people begging us ” said Rod Sullivan  the chair of the board of supervisors in Johnson County  Iowa  who said he had gotten calls at home and on his cellphone asking why he had not done more to keep people at home. Under state law  he said  such an order must come from the governor. “It’s hard to just tell them there’s nothing we can do ” he said. Many residents said they were taking precautions and social distancing anyway  organizing virtual Bingo games  taking children on “bear hunts” to see teddy bears positioned outside homes or in windows in the neighborhood and organizing car cruise nights  where residents pile in their cars and drive the local strip  waving at each other from a safe distance. “You end up with some self-governance ” said Michael Stepp  the owner of a tap room and coffee spot in O’Neill  Neb.  who said he did not think a statewide order is needed because most residents  like himself  are largely staying home anyway. “It’s more a result of the general outlook and demeanor of Midwest people ” he said. “Everybody wants to be helpful.” For some  further restrictions seemed both daunting and unnecessary. Connie Wright is already working out of her home in Altoona  Iowa  coordinating insurance payments for a hospital system. Her gym is closed  so she cannot get out of the house to take Zumba classes and chat with friends she has made there. The only thing keeping her sane these days  it seems  is walking on the bike trail behind her house and seeing her grandchildren  who still come over to dance to Disney music and songs from the 1960s. She fears that even those small comforts could go away if the governor gives in to what Ms. Wright sees as pressure from critics to issue a stay-at-home order. “It would be depressing ” said Ms. Wright  51  who said she appreciated that the governor was showing faith in residents to do the right thing. “You might as well slap an ankle bracelet on me.” A stretch of Interstate 40  which runs from downtown Memphis across the Mississippi River into Arkansas  has come to illustrate the patchwork of rules restricting movement in the United States. On the Arkansas side of the river  where the governor has resisted a statewide mandate  some “nonessential” businesses remain open. On the Tennessee side  a stay-at-home order went into effect this week  closing stores. Now  the owner of a chain of clothing stores called Deep South located on both sides of the Mississippi is operating under two different sets of rules. The company’s owner  Munther Awad  a 47-year-old immigrant from the Middle East  said he owned two stores in Arkansas  which are open  one in West Memphis and another in Little Rock. And he owns a third store in Memphis  which is now closed because of a local mandate last week. “I feel like if you would have just went ahead and put the whole nation at the same time on a lockdown  we could have got some control over it ” said Lavanda Mayfield  33  who was waiting to serve takeout to customers at the Iron Skillet restaurant at a truck stop near I-40 in West Memphis on Friday. “But now it’s just out of control ” she said  “because you did state-to-state.” Reporting was contributed by Audra D.S.

By Miriam Jordan LOS ANGELES — Like legions of immigrant farmworkers  Nancy Silva for years has done the grueling work of picking fresh fruit that Americans savor  all the while afraid that one day she could lose her livelihood because she is in the country illegally. But the widening coronavirus pandemic has brought an unusual kind of recognition: Her job as a field worker has been deemed by the federal government as “essential” to the country. Ms. Silva  who has spent much of her life in the United States evading law enforcement  now carries a letter from her employer in her wallet  declaring that the Department of Homeland Security considers her “critical to the food supply chain.” “It’s like suddenly they realized we are here contributing ” said Ms. Silva  a 43-year-old immigrant from Mexico who has been working in the clementine groves south of Bakersfield  Calif. It is an open secret that the vast majority of people who harvest America’s food are undocumented immigrants  mainly from Mexico  many of them decades-long residents of the United States. Often the parents of American-born children  they have lived for years with the cloud of deportation hanging over their households. The “essential work” letters that many now carry are not a free pass from immigration authorities  who could still deport Ms. Silva and other undocumented field workers at any time. But local law enforcement authorities said the letters might give immigrant workers a sense of security that they will not be arrested for violating stay-at-home orders. “If you have people who perceive that they may be stopped and questioned or deported because of their status  under these circumstances  having that letter makes them feel comfortable ” said Eric Buschow  a captain with the sheriff’s office in Ventura County  where thousands of farmworkers labor in strawberry  lemon and avocado operations. “They can go to work. And their work is essential now.” The pandemic has also put many of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations on hold. On March 18  the agency said it would “temporarily adjust its enforcement posture” to focus not on ordinary undocumented immigrants  but on those who pose a public safety or criminal threat. The agency said it would not carry out enforcement actions near health care facilities “except in the most extraordinary of circumstances” and would instead focus its efforts on human trafficking  gangs and drug enforcement. “Those of us without papers live in fear that immigration will pick us up ” Ms. Silva said. “Now we are feeling more relaxed.” Across the country  farmworkers have been struggling to understand what the coronavirus outbreak will mean for their safety and livelihoods. Even if they face a lower risk of deportation  many worry that the close working conditions in fields and packing facilities put them at risk for contracting the virus  and some warehouse workers are seeing their hours cut as employers adjust to the shifting market. For many workers  the fact that they are now considered both illegal and essential is an irony that is not lost on them  nor is it for employers who have long had to navigate a legal thicket to maintain a work force in the fields. “It’s sad that it takes a health crisis like this to highlight the farmworkers’ importance ” said Hector Lujan  chief executive of Reiter Brothers  a large family-owned berry grower based in Oxnard  Calif.  that also has operations in Florida and the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Lujan  whose company employs thousands of field workers  described them as unsung heroes for guaranteeing that Americans have food security. “Maybe one of the benefits of this crisis is that they are recognized and come out of the shadows ” said Mr. Lujan  whose company has been lobbying Congress to pass a bill that would legalize immigrant farmworkers. About half of all crop hands in the United States  more than one million  are undocumented immigrants  according to the Agriculture Department. Growers and labor contractors estimate that the share is closer to 75 percent. Despite increased mechanization  the agriculture sector has continued to struggle with a dearth of labor because many fruits and vegetables must be harvested by hand to avoid bruising. In a 2017 survey of farmers by the California Farm Bureau  55 percent reported labor shortages  and the figure was nearly 70 percent for those who depend on seasonal workers. Wage increases in recent years have not compensated for the shortfall  growers said. Strawberry operations in California  apple orchards in Michigan and dairy farms in New York and Idaho are wrestling with a shrinking  aging work force  a crackdown at the border  and the failure of Congress to agree on an immigration overhaul that could provide a steady source of labor. A surge in deportations and the voluntary return of many Mexicans to their home country have aggravated the shortage. As a result  growers increasingly have turned to a seasonal guest-worker program  officially known as the H-2A program  to fill gaps in their labor supply. The number of workers on the visa rocketed to 257 667 in the 2019 fiscal year  compared with 48 336 workers in the 2005 fiscal year. Growers panicked after the State Department paused all visa processing in Mexico during the public health emergency. In response to an outcry  the department announced on March 26 that it would waive in-person interviews  enabling most applications to be vetted in time for the peak harvest. American agriculture is at a critical juncture  with a massive volume of produce to be harvested between now and August. In California  citrus fruit is still being plucked off the trees  strawberries are getting underway  and many other crops will ripen in the summer. In Georgia  Vidalia onions and peaches will soon be mature. In Washington  apple trees are heavy with fruit in the summer. Letters notifying undocumented workers that they are “essential ” when they still officially face potential deportation  are sending the same mixed signals that have long been at the root of American agricultural labor policy  according to many who work closely with the process. “Some people are really confused by the message ” said Reyna Lopez  executive director of P.C.U.N.  a union representing agricultural workers in Woodburn  Ore. “The government is telling them it needs them to go to work  but it hasn’t halted deportations.” She and other advocates said employers are not doing enough to educate their workers  who often do not speak English  about the coronavirus. “When people don’t understand the risks  they don’t take necessary precautions ” Ms. Lopez said. The pandemic carries particular risks for agricultural workers. Most do not receive sick pay if they fall ill  and they lack health insurance. The $2 trillion pandemic aid package that passed Congress last week does not offer any assistance to undocumented immigrants. Armando Elenes  secretary-treasurer of the United Farm Workers  said that letters affirming that workers are “essential” do not substitute for “meaningful steps to stem the pandemic by protecting farmworkers with basic actions.” Those would include  he said  extending sick leave to 40 hours or more  making it easier for workers to claim sick days and providing more aggressive disinfection of work areas. Some growers  like Reiter Brothers  have trained workers on how to stay healthy  including frequent handwashing and the proper techniques for coughing and sneezing. The company has increased the number of handwashing stations in the fields and spaced out workers who are picking strawberries. The company also offers medical care. Jim Cochran  a grower of organic berries  artichokes  broccoli and other crops in Santa Cruz  Calif.  told his workers that he would keep paying them if they contracted the virus and had to miss work  even for three weeks. But such policies are exceptions  according to the United Farm Workers. Agricultural workers in packing warehouses and poultry plants  who often work in close quarters  are both fearful of getting the virus and worried about recent cutbacks that have threatened their ability to work. Maura Fabian  48  packs grapes for schools and hospitals in a warehouse in the Central Valley near Fresno  where she said that about half the workers have been let go; the others  she said  including her  have had their hours drastically cut. Since March 16  Ms. Fabian has worked four-hour shifts most days  and been told not to report at all on other days. She assumes that her employer has thinned the packing lines because  with schools closed  demand for packed fruit is down. The company is also trying to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers  she said. “We’re afraid of this illness. But we are more afraid that we won’t be able to make a living ” said Ms. Fabian  a single mother who bought a house in October  where she lives with her three children. In Idaho  where a statewide stay-at-home order began on March 25  dairy owners are scrambling to ensure that the industry’s 8 000 workers  90 percent of them undocumented  can keep working. Even before the virus  the industry  which needs workers year-round to milk the cows  had been grappling with a labor shortfall. Rick Naerebout  chief executive of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association  said he had fielded calls from many dairy farmers worried that their workers may be unable to get to work if the authorities begin enforcing domestic travel restrictions. So he has been providing members with a template to print out on official letterhead and distribute to workers  stating that they are now considered essential workers  part of the nation’s critical infrastructure. “The fact that there is that cognitive recognition that we have to allow these individuals to travel to and from work because they are critical — that’s the complete opposite of what they’ve heard for nearly their entire lives  that they have taken away opportunities from Americans ” he said. “At the highest level of government  now we’ve seen this be recognized. Whether it’s formal or informal  there’s this acknowledgment that  you’re OK.” Caitlin Dickerson contributed reporting from New York.

See How the Crew Responded., The rousing show of support provided another gripping scene to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic: the rank and file cheering a boss they viewed as putting their safety ahead of his career., Supported by The rousing show of support provided another gripping scene to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic: the rank and file cheering a boss they viewed as putting their safety ahead of his career. By Helene Cooper  Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Eric Schmitt WASHINGTON — It was a send-off for the ages  with hundreds of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt cheering Capt. Brett E. Crozier  the commander who sacrificed his naval career by writing a letter to his superiors demanding more help as the novel coronavirus spread through the ship. The rousing show of support provided the latest gripping scene to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic: the rank and file shouting their admiration for a boss they viewed as putting their safety ahead of his career. The memes were quick to sprout on social media. On Reddit  one depicted Captain Crozier forced to choose between rescuing his career or his sailors from a burning building; he chooses his sailors. On Twitter  a slew of videos showed Captain Crozier’s walk down the gangway in Guam  most of them depicting him as a hero struck down by his superiors for trying to save the lives of his crew. “Wrongfully relieved of command but did right by sailors ” wrote Twitter user Dylan Castillo  alongside a video of Captain Crozier leaving his ship. But in removing Captain Crozier from command  senior Navy officials said they were protecting the historic practice that complaints and requests have to go up a formal chain of command. They argued that by sending his concerns to 20 or 30 people in a message that eventually leaked to news organizations  Captain Crozier showed he was no longer fit to lead the fast-moving effort to treat the crew and clean the ship. His removal from prestigious command of an aircraft carrier with almost 5 000 crew members has taken on an added significance  as his punishment is viewed by some in the military as indicative of the government’s handling of the entire pandemic  with public officials presenting upbeat pictures of the government’s response  while contrary voices are silenced. The cheering by the sailors is the most public repudiation of military practices to battle the virus since the pandemic began. At the Pentagon  officials expressed concern about the public image of a Defense Department not doing enough to stay ahead of the curve on the virus. Notably  the defense of the firing offered by senior Pentagon officials has centered around Captain Crozier not following the chain of command in writing his letter  which found its way to newspapers. In a circuitous explanation  Thomas B. Modly  the acting Navy secretary  said that Captain Crozier’s immediate superior did not know that the captain was going to write the letter  offering that act as an error in leadership and one of the reasons the Navy had lost confidence in the Roosevelt captain. But a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship. His letter  the official said  came because the Navy was still minimizing the risk. Mr. Modly insisted that his firing the captain for writing a letter asking for more help does not mean that subordinate officers are not allowed to raise criticisms and ask for assistance. “To our commanding officers ” Mr. Modly told reporters on Thursday  “it would be a mistake to view this decision as somehow not supportive of your duty to report problems  request help  protect your crews  challenge assumptions as you see fit.” But the removal of Captain Crozier will likely have a chilling effect on the willingness of commanders to bring bad news to their superiors. “There’s no question they had the authority to remove him ” Kathleen H. Hicks  a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration  said in an email. “The issue is one of poor judgment in choosing to do so. They are fueling mistrust in leader transparency  among service members  families  and surrounding/hosting communities.” Ms. Hicks  who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington  added that the episode “lays bare the broader incompatibility in the Defense Department’s dual-track approach of attempting to tightly control and centralize its strategic communications at the same time it has adopted a highly decentralized approach to combating the coronavirus.” Representative Ruben Gallego  Democrat of Arizona  is a former enlisted Marine who saw heavy combat in Iraq. In an interview Friday  he described the Navy’s actions in firing Captain Crozier as “dangerous.” “For the men and women on the Roosevelt and across the Navy  the message is this ” Mr. Gallego said. “If the commander is looking out for you and doesn’t go about it the right way he’s going to get punished. It’s dangerous  it’s going to impact morale and retention rates.” Mr. Gallego pointed to the firings of the commanders of the John McCain and the Fitzgerald  two destroyers that were involved in fatal accidents in 2017 that killed 17 sailors. Those firings came after months of investigations  while Captain Crozier was fired within three days of his letter becoming public. Yet the Trump administration has in several high-profile war crimes cases chosen not to punish those accused. President Trump  for instance  granted clemency to Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher  a Navy SEAL who was acquitted of murder last year but convicted of a lesser war crime. For the military  a core issue is that  as the virus spreads  it becomes increasingly difficult to carry on with training and missions. At U.S. military outposts around the world  commanders have stopped training alongside local forces and instituted other measures to seal off their troops from the virus. Even so  the moves are ultimately half measures as the military  especially those who are deployed  live in shared spaces and can hardly practice the social-distancing restrictions that public health experts recommend to curb the spread of the virus. That problem is only amplified in the Navy. Each ship — with confined berthing areas  mess halls and shared bathrooms — is a cramped cell where social distancing is nearly impossible. Once the virus gets on a ship  it is bound to spread  both military officials and infectious disease experts say. Already  Navy officials are worried that other ships may become infected. Other branches of the military are having issues as well. Air Force warplanes are flying fewer missions and conducting fewer trainings  operating with split shifts and split crews to limit the exposure of personnel to the virus. The Army has stopped training for some units  the better to limit chances of getting the virus. As part of his extended explanation of why he removed Captain Crozier  Mr. Modly asserted at a news conference Thursday that the release of Captain Crozier’s letter had panicked the crew and family members  and embarrassed the Navy’s leadership. “It undermines our efforts and the chain of command’s efforts to address this problem and creates a panic ” he said. “And creates a perception that the Navy’s not on the job  the government’s not on the job.” But videos taken by crew members aboard the Roosevelt and posted on social media on Friday seemed to contradict that assessment. The sailors on the Roosevelt did not look panicked. Since Captain Crozier’s letter first surfaced  the Navy had evacuated hundreds off the ship  with more each day. During Captain Crozier’s final walk off the ship  many sailors could be seen with their bags packed on the floor next to them as they cheered their departing captain. It was a surreal scene  beginning with Captain Crozier’s solemn walk through the massive ship’s sprawling hangar bay — a snaking procession that wrapped around a pair of dormant F/A-18 fighter jets and into the cool Guam night. There was the ship’s bell  and then its whistle. The crew  hundreds of them  some in civilian clothes  others in uniform  slowly saluted as Captain Crozier walked past with a black backpack slung over his left shoulder. “Captain  United States Navy  departing ” a voice piped in over the loudspeaker. As Captain Crozier reached the gangway  the slender ramp that stretched from ship to shore  he turned back toward his ship. His crew cheered. The nearly half dozen videos posted to social media  all from different angles amid the throng of sailors  include thundering cheers of “Captain Crozier.” One crew member yells  “Hooyah skipper!” In another video  someone says  “Now that’s how you send off one of the greatest captains you ever had … the GOAT ” using the acronym for Greatest Of All Time. “The man for the people.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.

If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.

Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-medical-advisers.html, us politics, Tensions Persist Between Trump and Medical Advisers Over the Coronavirus, The president’s public refusal to wear a mask was the latest way he has cast doubt on their recommendations., Supported by The president’s public refusal to wear a mask was the latest way he has cast doubt on their recommendations. By Peter Baker  Maggie Haberman and James Glanz WASHINGTON — Rarely has the schism between President Trump and his own public health advisers over the coronavirus pandemic been put on display quite so starkly. Even as he announced a new federal recommendation on Friday that Americans wear masks when out in public  he immediately disavowed it: “I am choosing not to do it.” The striking dichotomy underscored how often Mr. Trump has been at odds with the medical experts seeking to guide his handling of the outbreak as well as some of the governors fighting it on the front lines  despite his move to extend social distancing guidelines through April 30 and his acknowledgment that the death toll could be staggering. While the health specialists and some governors press for a more aggressive  uniform national approach to the virus  the president has resisted expanding limits on daily life and sought to shift blame to the states for being unprepared to deal with the coronavirus. While they sound the alarm and call for more federal action  Mr. Trump has deflected responsibility and left it to others to take a more aggressive stance. Some of the president’s health advisers in recent days have argued that restrictions on social interaction and economic activity that have shut down much of the nation need to be expanded to all 50 states and that more Americans need to adopt them. Mr. Trump  by contrast  has characterized the crisis as generally limited to hot spots like New York  California and Michigan and has expressed no support for a nationwide lockdown. “I would leave it to the governors ” he said on Friday. As hospitals cope with shortages of medical equipment  the administration on Friday also rewrote the federal government’s stated mission for its stockpile of supplies to make clear that it sees itself as playing a secondary role to the states. Where the federal government once said the stockpile “ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need the most ” the revised version said the federal stockpile’s role was merely to “supplement state and local supplies.” The tension over the scale of the federal response comes as the president defends his administration’s reaction to the pandemic that has now infected more than 270 000 people in the United States and has killed more than 7 000. New polls showed that public support for Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis has begun to slip  a worrisome development for a president seeking re-election in the fall. Mr. Trump’s decision to take a back seat to the states by leaving it to them to decide whether to shut down public life and insisting they take the lead in addressing shortages amounts to a remarkable deference by a president who typically makes himself the center of the action. It also contrasts with his own self-description as a wartime president leading a great battle against an invisible enemy. It underscores both pragmatic and political imperatives for Mr. Trump  reflecting a traditional federalist approach that eschews imposing a one-size-fits-all national standard on states. But it also shows the president’s desire to blame the governors rather than accept any responsibility for shortages of ventilators  masks and other critical supplies. The most fundamental point of conflict centers over how broadly the virtual lockdown of many states in the Midwest and on the East and West Coasts should be expanded. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  said stay-at-home orders should be extended to the entire nation. “I don’t understand why that’s not happening ” Dr. Fauci said Thursday night on CNN. “The tension between federally mandated versus states’ rights to do what they want is something I don’t want to get into. But if you look at what is going on in this country  I don’t understand why we’re not doing that. We really should be.” His comments came after a telling interchange between Mr. Trump and Dr. Deborah L. Birx  the White House pandemic response coordinator  at the briefing on Thursday. Dr. Birx expressed concern that too many Americans were not following the guidelines. “I can tell by the curve and  as it is today  that not every American is following it ” she said. “And so this is really a call to action. We see Spain  we see Italy  we see France  we see Germany  when we see others beginning to bend their curves. We can bend ours  but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans.” When she returned to the issue a few minutes later  Mr. Trump tried to recalibrate her remarks. “But  Deborah  aren’t you referring to just a few states?” he said. “Because many of those states are dead flat.” “Yes  there are states that are dead flat ” she agreed. “But you know  what changes the curve is a new Detroit  a new Chicago  a new New Orleans  a new Colorado. Those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases.” In other words  without taking action  “dead flat” states can suddenly become hot spots. The interplay was a rare instance of Mr. Trump doing in real time on camera what officials have repeatedly denied that he does behind the scenes — attempting to water down the effect of what the medical experts were saying. In a video that leaked online last week  Dr. Fauci was seen telling colleagues at the National Institutes of Health that he regularly made suggestions for the president’s prepared remarks before the daily briefings but that Mr. Trump “almost always” ignores them. Where Dr. Fauci and the president have differed most strongly is on the therapeutic potential of chloroquines to treat people who have the coronavirus. Mr. Trump has said the drugs  which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for off-label uses aside from their intended treatment of ailments like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis  could be a “game-changer.” But Dr. Fauci has repeatedly sounded a note of skepticism  much to the president’s frustration. “I think we’ve got to be careful that we don’t make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug ” Dr. Fauci said Friday in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” Mr. Trump has also tried in recent days to blame states for shortages of medical equipment. “They should have had more ventilators ” he said on Friday. Jared Kushner  the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser  said at Thursday’s briefing that the federal stockpile was not for states to rely on. “The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile ” Mr. Kushner said. “It’s not supposed to be states’ stockpiles that they then use.” A day later  on Friday  the description on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website for its Strategic National Stockpile was altered evidently to reflect that viewpoint. Previously  the website said: “Strategic National Stockpile is the nation’s largest supply of lifesaving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.” “When state  local  tribal and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts ” it continued  “the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need the most during an emergency.” It went on to say the stockpile “contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.” But after the revisions  first noticed by the journalist Laura Bassett  the website on Friday said that the role of the stockpile was to “supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.” “Many states have products stockpiled as well ” it said. “The supplies  medicines and devices for lifesaving care contained in the stockpile ” the site added  “can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.” The explosive growth of the virus in many cities over the past two weeks has made clear that the United States has not been following the trajectory of places like Taiwan  Japan and Hong Kong that have kept outbreaks relatively contained so far. And the country has not begun to see the number of new cases level off yet  as Italy has. Several scientists said it was too early to make ironclad statements about whether social distancing was having a powerful effect. In a few cities that acted early  including New York  San Francisco and Seattle  new reported cases have begun to slow  providing some optimism that control measures work. “The growth rate in New York City is slowing. We do have evidence that measures we put in place two or three weeks ago may be having an effect ” said Jeffrey Shaman  a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. Data from Seattle and San Francisco  he said  shows “they’ve slowed it in spots.” “But whether they’re going to hold onto it is an open question ” he added. The number of cases and deaths in New York City has continued to rise quickly in recent days. More than 30 000 new cases in the metro area were reported since Monday for a total of more than 100 000 cases overall. The United States has seen new hot spots in New Orleans  Indianapolis  Chicago  Detroit and other cities that did not significantly reduce how much people traveled until mid- to late-March  leaving open a critical window for exponential growth. Florida  which took longer than most of the country to issue a stay-at-home order and reduce the distances that people traveled  reported increasing cases this week in the Miami  Tampa and Jacksonville areas. Experts say the delays in keeping people at home in Florida and much of the Southeast could make those areas more vulnerable to outbreaks in coming weeks. The low testing rate among the population can also muddle any assessment of the effect of distancing measures so far  said Lauren Ancel Meyers  a professor of biology and statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. “In many of these other places  where social distancing measures were enacted very recently  it would be very difficult to see it in the data yet ” Dr. Meyers said. “Even if it’s effective.” Peter Baker reported from Washington  and Maggie Haberman and James Glanz from New York. Josh Katz contributed reporting from New York. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-health-care-candidates.html, us politics, What It’s Like to Run for Congress Without Health Insurance During a Pandemic, Uninsured candidates must take extra care to protect their health as they campaign amid the coronavirus outbreak: “What if something does happen to me?”, Supported by Uninsured candidates must take extra care to protect their health as they campaign amid the coronavirus outbreak: “What if something does happen to me?” By Isabella Grullón Paz In the past week and a half  Cori Bush has been hospitalized twice with shortness of breath  sore throat  fatigue  loss of taste and a headache. Told at first that she had pneumonia  she was sent home  only to return to the emergency room when her symptoms didn’t improve. A coronavirus test came back negative  but she was admitted anyway. She was discharged on Wednesday. “I’m worried about the bill I’m going to receive ” she said. “I drove myself to the emergency room  even though I should have taken an ambulance  but I didn’t want that bill. And now the bill from the hospital stay  the bill from being admitted  and the doctor’s bill  which is all separate.” Ms. Bush  43  doesn’t have health insurance. She is also a candidate for Congress  trying for the second time to defeat Representative William Lacy Clay of Missouri  a 10-term incumbent  in a Democratic primary. She is one of several Democratic congressional candidates who gave up their employer-sponsored insurance when they decided to run for office  and whose platforms include expanding access to health care. The choice between keeping their own health insurance or trying to help others get such coverage wasn’t one they made lightly. Now  with the coronavirus outbreak putting electoral politics on pause across the country  they must take extra care to protect their health as they fight to maintain momentum around their campaigns. “It’s a difficult balance  and I have to be real with you  it’s a little scary  because I want to be out there ” said Samelys López  40  who is running in a crowded Democratic primary in New York’s 15th District and is seeking to succeed her former boss  Representative José E. Serrano  who is retiring. “What if something does happen to me?” she said. “I have to be even more vigilant because I don’t have health insurance at the moment. And I think that is the reason we need to make the case for universal health care. We should have these things as a human right — I shouldn’t have had to make that choice.” Nabilah Islam  one of several Democrats running to replace Representative Rob Woodall  a retiring Republican  in a district north of Atlanta  has not had insurance since 2018. “It was something that I forwent because running for office is cost-prohibitive  and it’s expensive to pay for health care ” she said. “I can’t even qualify for Medicaid  even if I wanted to.” Georgia is one of 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  and Ms. Islam is one of more than 100 000 people in her district who are uninsured. “God forbid I do get the virus ” Ms. Islam  30  said. “I would go into medical debt  and that’s not just me  that’s over 20 percent of my district.” As expensive as it can be to run for office  candidates without health insurance face even greater financial risks  since an unexpected ambulance ride or emergency room visit could put them thousands of dollars in debt. Ms. Islam lost her insurance in 2018  when she left her job as the Southern states finance director at the Democratic National Committee. She bought a flimsy off-market plan the next year  while she was working with local campaigns in Georgia. But now that she’s running herself  she has no protections at all. “When you run for office  you can’t do this part time. The deck is stacked against you if you do it part-time ” she said. “And if you are a wealthier person  you have the advantages of not really having to worry about health insurance. You’re able to run more freely.” The prospect of going without health insurance  pandemic or not  can deter people from running for office  particularly those who are political outsiders. “It’s one of these additional barriers for candidates who are working class ” said Hannah Nayowith  who served as campaign manager for Jessica Cisneros  who narrowly lost a primary race last month to unseat Representative Henry Cuellar  Democrat of Texas. Ms. Cisneros ran a grass-roots campaign while uninsured  even though she provided insurance for her full-time staff. There were times she had to cross the border into Mexico for procedures and medication  because they were more affordable there. Ms. Nayowith noted that the Democratic Party has often called for greater representation by candidates of color and working-class people. But many of those people are less likely to have health insurance. “For folks that look like the kind of candidates that we want in this new era of politics ” she said  “it makes it even harder for them to do it.” “The system wasn’t designed to elect people like me: working people  women of color ” Ms. Islam said. “And one of those structural barriers is health care.” When Ms. Bush decided to run for a second time  it was hard for her to leave her job as a nurse in a community health clinic  particularly because she is a single parent of two children. In fact  she had planned to keep working until her campaign got off the ground. “I was going to work for several months and then take off later in the race. It just didn’t end up happening that way ” she said. “It’s hard to keep a job or find a job when you’re running against a Democratic incumbent.” She is doing her best to keep her campaign going while she recovers from pneumonia  staying present on social media until she feels healthy enough to become more active. “We structured our campaign to where it continues to roll even when I’m sick ” Ms. Bush said. “We will be able to make it day by day. But once I’m back  I’m back.” Ms. López  who was once homeless herself  left her job at a nonprofit group that builds housing for the homeless in order to run. She mulled the decision for months  and the prospect of losing her health insurance and her income was one reason it took so long to make up her mind. She had some savings  enabling her to take the leap  but she said that money would run out soon. Right now  she said  her focus is on helping people in her Bronx district  where many people live in poverty and which has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus. As her entire campaign operation moved online  she began using her network of volunteers not only to phone and text bank but also to try to get resources and supplies to those who needed them. She’s currently staying isolated  since she knows her health is directly related to the well-being of her campaign. “I feel like I’m being penalized ” Ms. López said. “Just because we make a decision to be in public service and give back  doesn’t mean that we should be choosing between life  death and illness.” Candidates who don’t have health care are often unable to provide insurance to their employees as well  leaving multiple layers of their campaigns vulnerable during a pandemic. “We aren’t able to raise the funds to be able to be able to pay a salary and have health insurance ” Ms. Bush said. “It was something that we really wanted to be able to do.” Isra Allison  Ms. Bush’s campaign manager  has worked for a string of grass-roots campaigns and  as a result  hasn’t had health insurance in four years. “Having access to universal health care will give people more of the opportunity to plug in to a grass-roots campaign if it’s something that they’re passionate about ” she said. Ms. Islam petitioned the Federal Election Commission in early January to be able to use campaign funds to pay for health insurance  seeking to level the playing field for candidates like her. “I believe that if you’re on the campaign trail  you should be able to have health care ” Ms. Islam said. “Especially during a pandemic.” She said she still hadn’t heard back. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/us/politics/03virus-uninsured-candidates-03-01/03virus-uninsured-candidates-03-01-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/21/reader-center/author-isabella-grullon-paz/author-isabella-grullon-paz-thumbLarge.png 
02/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/hasher-jallal-taheb-white-house-attack.html, us, Man Pleads Guilty to Plotting to Attack White House With Anti-Tank Missile, Hasher Jallal Taheb  23  also targeted the Statue of Liberty  the Washington Monument  the Lincoln Memorial and a synagogue  prosecutors said., Supported by Hasher Jallal Taheb  23  also targeted the Statue of Liberty  the Washington Monument  the Lincoln Memorial and a synagogue  prosecutors said. By Neil Vigdor A Georgia man who sought to obtain an anti-tank missile pleaded guilty this week to plotting terrorist attacks on the White House  the Statue of Liberty and other landmarks  federal prosecutors said. The man  Hasher Jallal Taheb  23  of Cumming  Ga.  faces up to 20 years in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of five years after accepting a plea agreement on Wednesday in United States District Court in Atlanta  the authorities said. Mr. Taheb emerged as a suspect in March 2018  when local police received a tip from someone in his community saying that Mr. Taheb had become radicalized  changed his name and planned to travel abroad  the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. When Mr. Taheb later advertised his vehicle for sale  an F.B.I. informant said he was interested in buying it. That is when Mr. Taheb revealed his plans to carry out terrorist attacks on targets that included the Washington Monument  the Lincoln Memorial and a synagogue in Washington  D.C.  the authorities said. The informant introduced Mr. Taheb to an undercover F.B.I. agent  to whom he showed a hand-drawn diagram of the West Wing of the White House  a criminal affidavit said. Federal agents said they arrested Mr. Taheb in January 2019 when he showed up in a store parking lot in Buford  Ga.  to obtain an AT-4 anti-tank weapon  explosives and assault rifles. “Taheb planned to conduct a terrorist attack on the White House as part of what he claimed was his obligation to engage in jihad ” John C. Demers  an assistant attorney general for national security  said in a statement on Wednesday. “And that was just one of the iconic American landmarks he wanted to target.” Mr. Taheb pleaded guilty to attempted destruction of U.S. government property by fire or explosive  and he is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23  according to court filings. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Mr. Taheb told the informant that he wanted to do as much damage as possible and that he expected to be a “martyr ” Tyler S. Krueger  an F.B.I. special agent  wrote in the criminal affidavit. Mr. Taheb also told an undercover F.B.I. agent that he had created a channel on a video-sharing website to post clips before the attacks  the affidavit said. The videos included images of oppressed Muslims with American and Israeli flags being burned in the background. Mr. Krueger wrote in the affidavit that Mr. Taheb discussed his plot to attack the White House in detail. “Specifically  he described his plan to use the AT-4 to blow a hole in the White House so that the group could enter ” Mr. Krueger wrote. F.B.I. officials said on Wednesday that tips from the public were crucial in thwarting the kinds of attacks that Mr. Taheb had been planning.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/africa/uganda-museveni-nyanzi.html, world africa, ‘I Refuse to Be Repentant’: The Woman Challenging Uganda’s Ruler, Stella Nyanzi mixes profanity and bawdy humor with razor-sharp political insights to criticize the country’s autocratic president., Supported by The Saturday Profile Stella Nyanzi mixes profanity and bawdy humor with razor-sharp political insights to criticize the country’s autocratic president. By Abdi Latif Dahir KAMPALA  Uganda — The tears began flowing immediately after Stella Nyanzi began to speak. It was a cool mid-March afternoon  three weeks after Ms. Nyanzi  a Ugandan scholar and feminist  was released from prison for insulting the country’s longtime president  Yoweri Museveni. Before her was an array of political activists and community organizers  many of whom had traveled long distances to celebrate her newfound freedom at a hotel in Kampala  the capital. “Thank you for loving me ” she said  drying her tears. “To love me is to invite hate. Some of us have been hated so much that we don’t know how to do love.” But Ms. Nyanzi  who speaks with a ringing  authoritative voice  quickly got back to her remarks  urging activists in rural and urban areas to work together to build stronger grass-roots coalitions that could challenge the country’s political elite and empower marginalized people. “We can laugh when we are liberated from Museveni ” she said of the 75-year-old president  once the darling of Western democracy advocates whose rule has devolved into outright autocracy. “Please be bad for the sake of the cause ” she exhorted the activists  and with an impish grin added  “And don’t get caught while being bad.” Ms. Nyanzi  45  has in recent years become one of the most potent foes of Mr. Museveni  who has governed the East African nation for 34 years. With over 212 000 followers on Facebook  Ms. Nyanzi mixes profanity and bawdy humor with razor-sharp political insights in both English and Luganda to taunt the president and his family and agitate for sociopolitical and economic change. In a country where freely expressing opinions is a risky endeavor  her denunciations have put her in the sights of the government’s security apparatus. But she has never been the shrinking violet sort. In 2016  when Ms. Nyanzi was suspended from her teaching post at Makerere University  the country’s largest and most prestigious university  she stripped naked and chained herself in her office in protest. In 2017  she was detained for over a month after calling Mr. Museveni “a pair of buttocks” in a Facebook post. Officials tried to commit her to a mental hospital. In 2018  she was arrested and charged with cyberharassment after writing a poem about the president’s mother’s vagina  leading to an 18-month jail sentence last August. While attending the verdict via video link  Ms. Nyanzi screamed obscenities at the court and bared her breasts in protest. But after a court quashed that sentence in late February  Ms. Nyanzi said she came out more determined than ever to skewer the president and his allies — and risk going back to prison. “I refuse to be repentant ” she said in an interview one recent morning at her home in Kampala. Images of her three children — a daughter  Baraka  15  and twin sons  Wasswa and Kato  12 — hang next to shelves filled with books on sexuality  gender studies and self-improvement  along with parliamentary reports dating to the 1980s. She and the children’s father  Ousman Bah  separated 13 years ago. Ms. Nyanzi says she’s not preoccupied with Mr. Museveni himself  but is “obsessed with the abuser of the seat of the president; he is the liberator who is now an oppressor.” When he captured power in 1986  Mr. Museveni promised “a fundamental change in the politics of our government” and an end to years of lawlessness  political strife and human rights abuses. But his critics accuse him of overseeing a government with high levels of corruption  expanding digital surveillance powers and refusing to address growing unemployment and poverty. Citizens  exasperated by the country’s direction  have increasingly taken to the streets in recent years  protesting escalating food and fuel prices  anti-gay legislation  tuition increases and the failure of the police to investigate violence against women. Ms. Nyanzi has not only helped to organize and lead some of these protests; she’s also written about them in academic journals and on social media platforms  the latter in her characteristically sardonic style. The eldest of four sisters  Ms. Nyanzi was born in the town of Jinja in southeastern Uganda  where her father worked as a doctor and her mother was a social worker. (She also has eight half-siblings from her father.) A trained medical anthropologist with degrees from Makerere University  University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  she said she was always aware of her relatively privileged upbringing. “I know what it means to have ” she says  “but I refuse to be guilty about privilege because you can use it to help others.” As a medical anthropologist  Ms. Nyanzi has delved into a wide range of issues  including the negotiation of sexual relationships among Ugandan students  the impact of H.I.V. and AIDS on rural communities and homosexuality in Africa. But she has a public  nonacademic side  trying to break down complex ideas into what she calls “chewable posts” on Facebook  covering cultural and health issues  as well as topics on sexuality  gender  law and politics. “Social media is very elitist ” she said. “By using it  I know we are excluding a huge majority of the population.” But it scares the powerful  she said  mentioning a controversial social media tax that the authorities introduced in 2018 and that has depressed usage. Lacing her messages online with invective and sexual metaphors helps her to reach a large number of people  Ms. Nyanzi says. In a recently published collection of poems written behind bars and titled “No Roses From My Mouth ” she compares jail to sexual intercourse  concluding neither “lasts forever.” “Many people ask me  ‘Why sex?’ I ask  ‘Why not?’ It’s a perfect thing that we are all thinking about ” she said. Her writings have predictably drawn criticism from the country’s more conservative elements  but also from fellow activists  who believe her antics detract from their message. “You can oppose Mr. Museveni while also remaining civil and respectful ” a journalist  Musaazi Namiti  wrote recently. “Obscene expletives and shocking sexual imagery dumped on social media in the name of opposing a power-hungry president are not alternative policies. They cannot propel Uganda forward.” In the face of such criticism  Ms. Nyanzi remains  as she said  unrepentant. “They say I am reckless; they want me to silence myself  to edit my rudeness ” she said. “I am an academic  not a politician. I want the issues flagged out there  and if I lose a few supporters in the process  then perhaps the issues are much more important.” Out of prison now  Ms. Nyanzi is spending more time with her children  taking them to the zoo and poetry readings  where fans applaud when she walks in and ask for selfies and autographs. While her children understand her drive and cause — they help make placards for her protests — she says she knows her absence takes a toll on them. “They sometimes ask me  ‘Mom  why do you love Uganda more than us?’” she said on a recent drive while one of her twin boys sat in the car. “I want to be there for them. I want to have an input on their lives. I hope they forgive me.” Ms. Nyanzi is also spending time with her partner  David Musiri  an activist who is also the father of the baby she miscarried in prison. The two met in 2018 while protesting in front of Police Headquarters to get clearance for a march demanding government action against a spate of kidnappings and murders of women in Kampala. “I immediately fell in love with him ” she said. On a quiet Sunday in March  she and Mr. Musiri visited the grave of his adopted father  who died last year while Ms. Nyanzi was still in detention. After giving her respects  she said she was determined to work hard and lay the groundwork that will see Mr. Museveni go before or after she dies. She’s also mulling a run for office as Uganda’s 2021 elections draw closer. “The suppression will continue ” she said. “I know I will go back to prison. They will handcuff my body but not my spirit.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/world/Uganda01/Uganda01-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/myanmar-journalists-arrest-arakan.html, world asia, Myanmar Journalists Who Quoted Rebel Spokesman Face Arrest, The authorities detained one editor and were seeking two others after they published stories on the rebel Arakan Army. Their news websites were also blocked., Supported by The authorities detained one editor and were seeking two others after they published stories on the rebel Arakan Army. Their news websites were also blocked. By Saw Nang and Richard C. Paddock MANDALAY  Myanmar — In a new crackdown on free speech  the Myanmar authorities have arrested a prominent editor on terrorism charges for publishing an interview with a rebel army spokesman  and on Friday they were seeking two more editors on similar charges. In recent days  the authorities have raided journalists’ homes and offices  interrogated reporters about their coverage and blocked websites that were reporting on armed conflict with ethnic groups. News sites run by the three editors were among those blocked under the government order. Journalists and human rights activists said the government’s actions — including the arrest on Monday of U Nay Myo Lin  editor in chief of Voice of Myanmar  an independent news site based in Mandalay — were an attempt to reinstate authoritarian measures like those of Myanmar’s former military regime  at a time when most of the world is focused on stopping the coronavirus pandemic. “During this critical time  we believe that it is very dangerous and irrational to detain journalists and block access to media  which are the eyes and ears of the people ” said the Myanmar Press Freedom Center  a media advocacy group in Yangon  Myanmar’s largest city. Health experts  meanwhile  worry that the government is insufficiently focused on containing the coronavirus. The government has done little to prepare for the pandemic; it has conducted just 644 tests in a country of more than 50 million people  reporting only 20 cases. The military  known as the Tatmadaw  is battling rebel ethnic groups on three fronts  but it has not proposed cease-fires during the pandemic. Myanmar has an elected civilian government  but the military is independent under the Constitution  which it drafted. The authorities have repeatedly targeted journalists in recent years. Two reporters for the Reuters news agency were sentenced to seven years in prison in 2018 after they exposed a military massacre in the state of Rakhine. The two were later pardoned and released. The governing party  the National League for Democracy  which is headed by the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and won by a landslide in 2015  is heading into new elections this year with diminished support from many ethnic groups. The Tatmadaw’s biggest military campaign is against the Arakan Army  a rebel ethnic group that is fighting to create an independent territory in Rakhine  along the lines of the ancient Arakan kingdom that was once there. The Arakan Army  formed a decade ago  says it has 7 000 soldiers. It has killed hundreds of Myanmar troops and staged dozens of abductions  including a daring raid in October  when rebels dressed as soccer players ambushed a bus and seized 31 people. Rakhine came to the world’s attention in 2017 with the brutal ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims carried out by the Tatmadaw  including a campaign of murder  rape and the burning of villages. Since then  more than 700 000 Rohingya have fled across the border into Bangladesh  where they live in squalid refugee camps with little chance of returning. Meanwhile  the Arakan Army has been waging war against the Tatmadaw in the same part of the country. On March 23  Myanmar declared the Arakan Army to be a terrorist group. The government also ordered communications companies to block at least 220 websites. Most were said to be pornography sites  but the list also included media outlets that cover news in areas where ethnic conflicts have broken out  including Rakhine. Myanmar’s director general of communication  U Myo Swe  said in an interview that media sites had been blocked to keep them from posting “fake news” about the coronavirus  or news that would contribute to instability in the country. “In this time of the coronavirus pandemic  some websites are publishing fake news about the virus and it harms the public ” he said  without citing any examples. He declined to comment when asked whether the website closures were aimed at suppressing press freedom. The government has blocked internet access since June in parts of Rakhine and the state of Chin where the Arakan Army operates  in what amounts to one of the longest internet shutdowns by any government in the world. Mr. Nay Myo Lin  the Voice of Myanmar editor  was arrested on Monday on terrorism charges after posting an interview with the Arakan Army spokesman  U Khaing Thu Kha. Mr. Nay Myo Lin faces up to life in prison. The next day  the police raided the office of Narinjara  a news outlet based in the Rakhine city of Sittwe  seeking to arrest its editor in chief  U Khaing Mrat Kyaw  who also had posted an interview with the rebel spokesman. Mr. Khaing was not at the office and is now said to be in hiding. The police seized computers and detained three Narinjara journalists  who were released that evening. “We are not committing a crime. We are doing our job ” said U Thant Myat Khaing  a reporter who was detained and interrogated. “When people are focusing on virus news  they are arresting journalists to shut down the information.” Late Tuesday night  the police raided the homes of several editors at the media outlet Yangon Khit Thit Media  including the home of the editor in chief  U Thar Lon Zaung Htet  who published a similar interview with the rebel spokesman. Mr. Thar’s whereabouts was unknown Friday. “Yangon Khit Thit Media reports news ethically and violates no terrorist law ” the outlet said in a statement after the raids. “This situation is unacceptable and threatens the Myanmar media.” Phil Robertson  the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch  said it was distressing to see Myanmar roll back media freedoms while most of the world is preoccupied with battling the coronavirus. “Myanmar’s military  and their accomplices in the civilian government  have realized the global Covid-19 crisis provides a golden opportunity to take care of repressive business while diplomats and the international media are distracted ” he said. Saw Nang reported from Mandalay  and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/arts/music/bill-withers-dead.html, arts music, Bill Withers  Who Sang ‘Lean on Me’ and ‘Ain’t No Sunshine ’ Dies at 81, A three-time Grammy Award winner  he had a string of much-covered hits in the 1970s but had not released an album since 1985., Supported by A three-time Grammy Award winner  he had a string of much-covered hits in the 1970s but had not released an album since 1985. By Neil Genzlinger Bill Withers  a onetime Navy aircraft mechanic who  after teaching himself to play the guitar  wrote some of the most memorable and often-covered songs of the 1970s  including “Lean on Me ” “Ain’t No Sunshine” and “Use Me ” died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 81. His death  at a hospital  was announced by his family. His son  Todd  said Mr. Withers had had heart problems. Mr. Withers  who had an evocative  gritty R&B voice that could embody loss or hope  was in his 30s when he released his first album  “Just as I Am ” in 1971. It included “Ain’t No Sunshine ” a mournful lament (“Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone/And she’s always gone too long/Anytime she goes away”) that cracked the Billboard Top 10. Other hits followed  perhaps none better known than “Lean on Me ” an anthem of friendship and support that hit No. 1 in 1972 and has been repurposed countless times by a variety of artists. There were also “Use Me” (1972)  “Lovely Day” (1977) and “Just the Two of Us” (1981)  among other hits. But after the 1985 album “Watching You Watching Me ” frustrated with the music business  Mr. Withers stopped recording and performing. “I wouldn’t know a pop chart from a Pop-Tart ” he told Rolling Stone in 2015  when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. “Bill was a mystical man ” Leo Sacks  who supervised the rerelease of Mr. Withers’s catalog for Sony Legacy Recordings  including a 2012 box that won a Grammy for best historical recording  said by email. “Like a Greek oracle. But he let the songs speak for themselves. He sang so conversationally and universally  like he was sitting next to you. His songs made every word count.” William Harrison Withers Jr. was born on July 4  1938  in Slab Fork  W.Va.  to William and Mattie (Galloway) Withers. His mother was a maid  and his father worked in the coal mines. At 17  eager to avoid a coal-mine career himself  Mr. Withers joined the Navy. “My first goal was  I didn’t want to be a cook or a steward ” he told Rolling Stone. “So I went to aircraft-mechanic school.” He spent nine years in the service  some of it stationed in Guam. He quit the Navy in 1965  while stationed in California  and eventually got a job at an airplane parts factory. A visit to a nightclub to see Lou Rawls perform was a catalyst for changing his life. “I was making $3 an hour  looking for friendly women  but nobody found me interesting ” he said. “Then Rawls walked in  and all these women are talking to him.” He bought a cheap guitar at a pawnshop  started learning to play it and writing songs  and eventually recorded a demo. Clarence Avant  a music executive who had just founded an independent label  Sussex  took note and set him up with the keyboardist Booker T. Jones  of Booker T. & the MG’s  to produce an album. “Bill came right from the factory and showed up in his old brogans and his old clunk of a car with a notebook full of songs ” Mr. Jones told Rolling Stone. “When he saw everyone in the studio  he asked to speak to me privately and said  ‘Booker  who is going to sing these songs?’ I said  ‘You are  Bill.’ He was expecting some other vocalist to show up.” Mr. Withers was laid off from his factory job a few months before “Just as I Am” came out. After the album’s release  he recalled  he received two letters on the same day. One was from his workplace asking him to return to work. The other was from “The Tonight Show ” where he appeared in November 1971. That “Ain’t No Sunshine” became a hit off that album was unexpected. “‘Ain’t No Sunshine’ was the B-side to ‘Harlem’ ” he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland in 2015  referring to another track from the album  “until the D.J.s turned it over.” The song  he said  had just come to him one day. “I was watching the movie ‘The Days of Wine and Roses ’ looked out the window and it crossed my mind ” he told The Plain Dealer. “Probably some girl had left me  but ego preservation has taught me to avoid inconvenient truths.” “Ain’t No Sunshine” won the Grammy Award for best rhythm and blues song. “Lean on Me” and “Just the Two of Us” (a collaboration with the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr.  written with William Salter and Ralph MacDonald) won the same award. Mr. Withers released six other studio albums in the 1970s  for Sussex and then Columbia  and performed across the country and beyond. One memorable appearance was at the music festival in Zaire in 1974 that preceded the “Rumble in the Jungle ” the heavyweight fight between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. But he also played clubs like the Bottom Line in Manhattan. “Mr. Withers’s lyrics are among the most thoughtful in all of pop music ” Robert Palmer wrote in The New York Times  reviewing a 1976 show there  “but his work also has its physical side. Many of his tunes simmer irresistibly  as if cooking over a low flame.” Mr. Withers chafed at Columbia  clashing with executives  and after the release of “Watching You Watching Me” in 1985  he was done with the music business. Years later he liked to tell stories about not being recognized in public. One such incident occurred at a Los Angeles restaurant. “Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles up on Pico ” he told NPR’s “Morning Edition” in 2015  “and these ladies looked like they had just come from church or something  and they were talking about this Bill Withers song. So I was going to have some fun with them. I said  ‘I’m Bill Withers ’ and this lady said: ‘You ain’t no Bill Withers. You too light-skinned to be Bill Withers.’” Mr. Withers’s brief marriage to the actress Denise Nicholas in the 1970s ended in divorce. In 1976 he married Marcia Johnson. She and their son survive him  along with their daughter  Kori  and a sister  Florence Mather. In 2015  in advance of a tribute concert in his honor at Carnegie Hall  Mr. Withers was interviewed at a restaurant by a reporter for The Times. The talk turned to how  with no music training  he had managed to fashion a career in music relatively late in life. “It was just something I decided to do ” he said. “If I decided to build one of these fountains” — he pointed to a decoration on the restaurant’s patio — “I could probably do it.” He could also probably have resumed his career at any time. “Late in life  he would tease us about recording again ” Mr. Sacks said. “But I think he was truly ambivalent. He said he didn’t think anyone was interested in what an ‘old man’ had to say. And that was Bill to a tee: wily  cunning  self-effacing. Utterly disingenuous.” Derrick Bryson Taylor contributed reporting.

With seasons on pause because of the coronavirus  it’s another reminder to customers of what they’re paying for but not getting., Supported by Some providers break out sports fees on bills. With seasons on pause because of the coronavirus  it’s another reminder to customers of what they’re paying for but not getting. By Kevin Draper Joyce Sanz recently called Comcast hoping to reduce the $164 each month her family pays for cable television and internet. An after-school program manager at an elementary school in Miami  Sanz wanted to trim expenses in case the economic fallout related to the coronavirus pandemic lasts months. Sanz said she asked the Comcast customer service representative for a discount or deferred payment options. No dice. She asked to be charged the prices offered to new customers. No can do. Finally  she spotted a specific line on her bill. “I am paying a sports fee ” she told the representative  recalling the conversation later during an interview. “Oh  we can’t take those out” was the response  leading Sanz to the obvious question: “If you are not giving the service  why do I have to keep paying for it?” Comcast and other cable and satellite TV companies are still providing subscribers with sports channels  of course. Sanz can still watch Fox Sports Florida  Fox Sports Sun and ESPN. But without live games featuring the Miami Heat  Miami Marlins  or other professional and college teams  those channels have been shells of their former selves. Nobody knows when major sports might be played widely again. Games would certainly be embraced by fans  but the sports ecosystem has taken a back seat to deeper concerns of public health and the global economy. But already sports leagues  television networks and television distributors are firing the opening salvos in what will be an exhausting war to determine who should pay for hundreds of millions — perhaps billions — in economic damages. “You always lawyer for the thing that will never happen ” said Erin McPherson  the head of consumer content and partnerships at Verizon. “And the thing that you think will never happen  happened.” As that takes shape  most American households will have little choice but to continue paying for live sports even as sports channels are reduced to reruns of historic games  documentaries and sports video game simulations. “They won’t throw money at their customers when their costs of goods hasn’t changed ” Craig Moffett  a co-founder of the media research firm MoffettNathanson  said of TV distributors. This is not the case in England  where pay television subscribers are more easily able to buy sports channels separately. Sky Sports  the main provider of televised sports  is allowing customers to pause their subscription payments as long as sports remain postponed. Some sports networks abroad are also beginning to push back against leagues. Canal+ in France  Globo in Brazil and NENT in the Nordic countries have all suspended some rights payments. Television is the biggest source of revenue for American sports. When people pay their monthly television bills  their money goes to television distributors  like Comcast  which in turn pay television networks  like ESPN  which in turn pay sports leagues  like the N.B.A. Along the way  everybody keeps a cut. But even if customers do not watch a single game  the majority of what they spend on bundled television packages goes to sports networks. This is because of the structure of the bundles  where customers pay one monthly price for dozens or hundreds of channels. Entertainment is available widely on streaming services  while news and sports programming is increasingly the only reason to still pay for bundled TV. “Sports are the glue that holds the bundle together ” Moffett said. “Without live sports  the value proposition to most households just isn’t terribly compelling anymore.” Television viewership  especially of news programming  is up lately  no doubt the consequence of nearly 300 million Americans under orders to stay at home. But with jobless claims reaching a record high  how many more people will look to cut the cord or  at the very least  push back on being charged for sports without getting live games? “A lot of them are going to get very familiar with how their TV service actually works  and how they can get rid of cable once and for all ” said Dave Warner  who created the website What You Pay for Sports in 2013 to educate fans about their television bills. McPherson  the Verizon executive  said the company had been recently reviewing its contractual relationships with networks and leagues in an attempt to reduce what the roughly four million Fios TV subscribers are paying. “We don’t want to charge our customers for content they aren’t watching and receiving ” she said. “Whether that is going to be in the form of a refund or discontinued billing  we are looking at all of those options right now.” However  Verizon does not feel it can unilaterally rebate subscribers. “We need the broadcasters and RSNs  and the leagues  to cooperate with that approach ” McPherson said. In at least being willing to discuss whether subscribers are currently getting what they pay for  McPherson is alone. AT&T  Comcast  Charter Communications and Dish Network — the four largest pay TV providers in the United States — all declined to make an executive available for an interview or answer questions about what subscribers should expect. Television distributors have historically felt they held little leverage in negotiations with sports networks. What networks pay sports leagues goes up each year. Sports networks raise prices as a result and pass large price increases on to distributors  who pass them on to subscribers. One way distributors have pushed back — and tried to deflect subscriber wrath — is by listing the costs for sports as a separate line item in bills  often terming it a “regional sports fee.” It is purposefully made to look like the actual fees and taxes imposed by state or federal regulators  but it is not the same. The model of regional sports networks  which has been so profitable for two decades  is showing signs of strain. The satellite television provider DISH Network has not carried 16 Fox Sports regional networks for the last nine months. A new Chicago sports network is having trouble getting distribution. Comcast has been sued by a Colorado regional sports network. In other words  the balance of the sports television ecosystem was already being disrupted before the coronavirus pandemic shut down sports. “Now imagine you have pulled out the last piece of the Jenga puzzle  which is that sports are no longer on the air ” Moffett said. “The whole foundation  the linchpin that was keeping it together  is gone  and the Jenga tower collapses.” The first sign of that collapse in America comes from DAZN  the sports streaming service that mostly shows boxing and baseball highlights in the United States  but is a major rightsholder in some other countries. DAZN has told some leagues it will defer payments for suspended or canceled competitions  according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Since it doesn’t receive payments from distributors as traditional television networks do  DAZN is attempting to conserve its cash. “DAZN is a pure sport play — when sports stops  so do many parts of our business ” wrote Simon Denyer  the chief executive of DAZN  in an email to employees on Tuesday announcing furloughs. The news was first reported by the Sports Business Journal. Regional sports networks  along with teams and leagues  face the biggest threat from a prolonged shutdown of live action  according to Moody’s Investor Service. If consumers balk at keeping subscriptions to sports networks  it “may affect affiliate fees unless their networks are part of the basic tier of pay TV ” wrote Moody’s in a recent research comment. That is little help to television subscribers like Sanz. She said she bought a Roku and is considering completely abandoning cable in favor of streaming. She has also called other companies that provide services she subscribes to  just to see if they would offer any discounts. When she reached Adobe  which charges her $39.99 each month for its Creative Cloud suite  she was given three free months. A small reprieve maybe  but significant. “It does matter at this point  when there is no income coming into the house ” she said. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/sports/00Virus-sportscable-print/00Virus-Television-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-kevin-draper/author-kevin-draper-thumbLarge.png https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/sports/02virus-sportscable-2/merlin_170960424_c991f9ce-3e01-4ddd-bd8d-d49c17089de5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
04/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/sports/olympics/coronavirus-olympics-athletes-funding.html, sports olympics, The $200 Million the Olympics Postponement Took From Team U.S.A., The Summer Olympics in Tokyo have been postponed a year. That means nearly $200 million in funding  which American athletes depend on for living and training expenses  likely won’t arrive until next August., Supported by The Summer Olympics in Tokyo have been postponed a year. That means nearly $200 million in funding  which American athletes depend on for living and training expenses  likely won’t arrive until next August. By Andrew Keh and Matthew Futterman Wallace Spearmon  a two-time Olympian in track and field  got what he wanted when the International Olympic Committee finally bowed to pressure from athletes and national Olympic organizations and postponed the 2020 Tokyo Games for a year. It made sense given the coronavirus pandemic. But the financial ripple effect might jeopardize his ability — and that of thousands of other American athletes — to train for the Games. “Hopefully the athletes don’t feel this  though we know we probably will ” said Spearmon  who is training in Arkansas to compete in the 200 or 400 meters. “A lot of us are already struggling to get by.” The anxiety is growing because the postponement has left the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee with a $200 million cash crunch that could leave athletes without the modest living and training stipends they rely on. The deficit comes while the committee simultaneously makes a push for the 2021 Summer Games and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. The organizations that run the individual Olympic sports in the United States  known as national governing bodies  were already trying to figure out how they will manage without income they were set to receive from thousands of events that have been canceled because of the pandemic. In recent days  U.S.A. Cycling laid off or furloughed 40 percent of what had been a 70-person staff. U.S. Rowing cut its staff by a third  also through a mix of furloughs and layoffs  and cut pay for much of the staff that remained. Now  funding from the U.S.O.P.C. is up in the air. “We have a rainy-day fund  but it’s raining awfully hard  awfully fast ” said Rob DeMartini  the chief executive of U.S.A. Cycling. The looming crisis is a result of the U.S.O.P.C.’s unique financial structure  which relies so heavily on nearly $200 million it receives every other year from its share of the U.S. media rights fees that NBCUniversal pays the I.O.C. to televise the Olympics. Unlike other national Olympic organizations  the U.S.O.P.C. receives no government funds. It pays for its operations and helps fund athletes and the national governing bodies of its sports through the sale of media and sponsorship rights and some modest fund-raising. The problem for the U.S.O.P.C. is that it does not get its share of the NBCUniversal money until after the Games occur. That money represents about 40 percent of the U.S.O.P.C.’s budget and allows it to distribute annually about $100 million  including $13 million in stipends directly to athletes and more than $75 million to the national governing bodies for their sports. For example  in 2016  U.S.A. Cycling received $2 million from the national committee  according to U.S.O.P.C. tax filings. The U.S. Fencing Association received $900 000. U.S.A. Gymnastics received $3 million. And even though the 2018 Winter Olympics were still more than a year away at the time  U.S. Figure Skating received $1 million  U.S.A. Curling got $842 000 and the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation received more than $2 million. Some of the organizations received more the following year. Also  direct payments for the athletes totaled $13 million each year as well  funding that helps roughly 2 000 athletes pay their rent and eat  using stipends that range from a few thousand dollars to as much as $21 000. There is also a discretionary fund of about $1 million to target a team or a group of athletes for whom a little extra support might make the difference between sixth place and a medal. Max Cobb  who leads the U.S. Biathlon Association and is the chairman of the council for the national sports organizations  said all of the projects the U.S.O.P.C. funds for athletes at the elite level and the grass roots now need to be reassessed and possibly put off for a year. In a statement Thursday  Morane Kerek  the U.S.O.P.C.’s  chief financial officer  said the organization is still evaluating the financial impact of the cancellation of the Games. “Given the uncertainty of the virus and its impact on the sports landscape we expect our analysis will continue to evolve over the coming weeks ” Kerek said. The U.S.O.P.C. could try to tap the United States Olympic Endowment  created in 1984 after the Los Angeles Games  to finance Olympic sports. The endowment has net assets of $185 million  according to its last financial report  but the U.S.O.P.C. tries to limit how much it asks to withdraw from the endowment  which is run independently  in any one year. What happens to the U.S.O.P.C.’s finances during the next 18 months may hinge on a delicate series of negotiations between the I.O.C. and NBCUniversal. In a conference call Thursday  Timo Lumme  the director of television and marketing services for the I.O.C.  said his organization is speaking to broadcasters to try to avoid leaving national Olympic committees and athletes without the funds they need. However  NBCUniversal is not obligated to make the bulk of its payment to the I.O.C. — roughly $1.2 billion — until shortly before the Olympics start. By that time  the network has finally received a steady stream of funds from advertisers. A spokesman for NBC Sports said Thursday that executives are “in constant communication with our partners at the I.O.C. ” but he declined to comment on any specific conversations. While those talks take shape  athletes and the people in charge of getting them the money they need are dealing with life in limbo. DeMartini  the U.S.A. Cycling chief executive  said the organization receives roughly one-third of its money from the U.S.O.P.C.  one-third from fund-raising and one-third from current racing. U.S.A. Cycling has received its U.S.O.P.C. money for this year but all riding in the country has stopped. Next year  riding will likely return but the Olympic money remains up in the air. “I’ve got a hole in my boat the size of a third  so I’ve got to take action ” he said. Susan Smith  the interim chief executive of U.S. Rowing  said her organization has applied for a low-interest loan through the Small Business Administration and reached out to donors for help covering the shortfalls that the cancellation of rowing’s busiest season of events has already produced. “It’s an interesting thing how a pandemic can focus an organization ” Smith said. Spearmon said athletes are already feeling the financial crunch  and if the U.S.O.P.C. has to dial back its funding that will only to make it worse. He is finally healthy from a calf injury two years ago  but there are no competitions where he can collect prize money or reach the standards that would requalify him for funding from the U.S.O.P.C. or the U.S.A. Track and Field. He doesn’t have a sponsor  and social distancing advisories prevent him from coaching. For those athletes who do have sponsorships  many of them have to renegotiate with shoe companies in December. That was supposed to be the end of an Olympic year  not the beginning of one. And it will be a bad time for companies dealing with the fallout from what economists predict will be a deep recession. “They are expressing how much money they have lost in last few months ” Spearmon said of the shoe companies. “There is so much unknown right now financially.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B.

Screens Won., , We’ve tried all sorts of things to stop us from staring at our devices. Digital detoxes. Abstinence. Now? Bring on the Zoom cocktail hour. Credit...Andrea Chronopoulos Supported by By Nellie Bowles Before the coronavirus  there was something I used to worry about. It was called screen time. Perhaps you remember it. I thought about it. I wrote about it. A lot. I would try different digital detoxes as if they were fad diets  each working for a week or two before I’d be back on that smooth glowing glass. Now I have thrown off the shackles of screen-time guilt. My television is on. My computer is open. My phone is unlocked  glittering. I want to be covered in screens. If I had a virtual reality headset nearby  I would strap it on. The screen is my only contact with my parents  whom I miss but can’t visit because I don’t want to accidentally kill them with the virus. It brings me into happy hours with my high school friends and gives me photos of people cooking on Facebook. Was there a time I thought Facebook was bad? An artery of dangerous propaganda flooding the country’s body politic? Maybe. I can’t remember. That was a different time. A lot of people are coming around. Walt Mossberg  my former boss and a longtime influential tech product reviewer  deactivated his Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2018 to protest Facebook’s policies and negligence around fake news. Now  for the duration of the pandemic  he is back. “I haven’t changed my mind about the company’s policies and actions ” Mr. Mossberg wrote on Twitter last week. “I just want to stay in touch with as many friends as possible.” Back to the Facebook basics. Here for the friends. Portal  Facebook’s countertop video tool  doesn’t seem so crazy now. Initiatives that were formed explicitly to help people escape screens are now adapting to  well  screens. “I started the Forest Bathing Club to get people and myself off screens in the 2-D world and into nature to experience the real world ” said Julia Plevin  a designer and founder of the Forest Bathing Club. “Now we’re doing virtual forest baths.” Avoiding screens guided the life choices of Arrington McCoy  a therapist in Boston  for many years. “I picked jobs based in large part on screens not being part of the equation ” she said  like becoming a backpacking instructor and now a therapist. “And as of 10 days ago  I am singing a different tune.” One friend of mine admitted averaging 16 hours of screen time a day  often on multiple devices at once. I’m 31 and have lived almost all my life in San Francisco  which means my friends are all having babies or they’re hosting forest baths. Given our demographic  most of those having babies crafted careful plans to keep those fresh eyes from screens. Plans to keep the babies from using screens  of course  but also away from even seeing the screens in use. How are those plans going now? “That went out the window last week ” said my friend Ashley Spinelli  an administrator at the University of California  Berkeley  who just had a boy  Nico. Shary Niv  a parent of a toddler  said  “I beg her to watch whatever children’s programming PBS is peddling on Amazon Prime.” Or there’s Miju Han  the director of product at HackerOne  a cybersecurity company in San Francisco. “My 6-week-old is starting to only know his grandparents from FaceTime ” she said. “The American Academy of Pediatrics is technically against this  but the grandparents really want to see their baby grandson.” The screen-time surrender isn’t just a San Francisco phenomenon. Daniela Helitzer  a doctor of audiology in Boca Raton  Fla.  said screen time used to be a constant debate among the parents in her town. She had some friends with toddlers who had never even seen a television turned on before this. Not anymore. “We’ve all officially lost the battle ” said Dr. Helitzer  who has a 2- and a 3-year-old. “I’ve accessed every educational app you can. I’ve used every online interactive worksheet I can find ” Dr. Helitzer said. “If he’s sitting on his iPad for two or three hours a day  I literally don’t even care. It’s like  ‘Use that screen as much as you can.’” Covered in screens these past few weeks  I have noticed some positive changes. I FaceTime my friends so much that I know them better than I did before. I decided to learn what TikTok was  and I love it. I spend hours with my chin tucked into my chest and a weird smile on my face  watching. I’m using Duolingo  an app to learn languages. Carolyn Guss  a mother of two and a vice president at PagerDuty  a cloud-computing company in San Francisco  was once very screen strict. Her children  8 and 9 years old  did not own any devices. They could watch only very limited television. On the first day of quarantine home school  Ms. Guss wrote up a schedule geared at keeping them off screens. “By Day 3  I had given up ” she said. “I think the fact that it rained on the first weekend broke my spirit.” Suddenly she was giving them her phone. She was sitting them at laptops. They were double-devicing. It felt like defeat. Then something surprising happened. They started doing pretty impressive stuff on those screens. “My son taught himself iMovie  and now the kids make videos of themselves doing basic things — making Jell-O  shooting hoops — then cut it into pretty professional looking footage ” she said. “Then they screen share it with their friends on Zoom. “These kids had no screen access before  and they leapfrogged me within days.” Screen-skeptics see this as an apocalyptic moment. Many activists spent years fighting online learning in schools. Face-to-face experience with teachers is irreplaceable  they argued. “Ed tech companies now are jumping on this and saying  ‘See  we told you ’” said Emily Cherkin  a screen-time consultant in Seattle. “Many of them are offering their services for free right now. It’s disaster capitalism.” But even some of the godparents of the screen-wary movement are coming around. One of the most prominent voices on this issue is Sherry Turkle. For years  she warned that technology was tearing social fabric apart. She wrote the book “Alone Together ” about the social pain that comes from silent family dinners and people walking  chins down  staring at their phones. Now  she is saying maybe some of the movement she inspired is focused in the wrong direction. “I think that this reveals the screen-time issue as a misplaced anxiety ” Ms. Turkle said. “Now  forced to be alone but wanting to be together  so many are discovering what screen time should be.” It should be about learning and connecting. It should be humanizing  Ms. Turkle said. All those Zoom cocktail hours are good screen time. Even parenting coaches  once hired to draft strict screen-time rules for the family  are saying it is probably time to throw those out. “Be gentle with yourself ” said Rhonda Moskowitz  founder of Practical Solutions Parent Coaching in Columbus  Ohio. “These are extreme times.” She said she was now meeting with her trainer via FaceTime and had attended a happy hour on Zoom  which was “a riot.” And the last thing I have noticed about myself is how absolutely thrilled I am now to see a human in the flesh. It is a small party every time. The more I use FaceTime  the more I hate not being able to hug my friends. Toasting a screen is not the same. In my pre-quarantine life  I could be a homebody  and I often worked from the living room. When this is done  that is  too. By all of us suddenly guzzling screen time  we might start to see the limitations of its high. Now that touch is the rarest thing of all  I crave it. The first thing I want to do when this is done is high-five every stranger I meet. That is not something I considered doing before. “Going on Week 2 of quarantine  our kids are desperate to see  touch  feel  smell their friends ” said Jon Steinberg  the creative director for Epic  a production and publishing company. “Weirdly  Gen Z could come out of this with a permanent  lifelong  forged-in-disaster appreciation for physical connections over digital ones.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/business/01screentime/31screentime-superJumbo.jpg 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/business/economy/coronavirus-jobs-report.html, business economy, Decade of Job Growth Comes to an End  Undone by a Pandemic, After an expansion that added 22 million to U.S. payrolls  March registered a loss  and worse is yet to come., Supported by After an expansion that added 22 million to U.S. payrolls  March registered a loss  and worse is yet to come. By Nelson D. Schwartz and Patricia Cohen The longest stretch of American job creation on record came to a halt last month  the Labor Department reported Friday  another reflection of the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the economy to a virtual standstill. Compared with the astounding numbers of people recently applying for unemployment benefits — nearly 10 million in the previous two weeks — the figure announced Friday was less striking: a loss of 701 000 jobs. But the data was mostly collected in the first half of the month  before stay-at-home orders began to cover much of the nation. With that  what had been a drip-drip-drip of job losses turned into a deluge. “As bad as this report is  next month will be many orders of magnitude worse ” said Michael Gapen  chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “This is the initial slippage of the labor market.” He said the March unemployment rate of 4.4 percent could rise to 13 percent in April. The decline in employment last month was the biggest monthly drop since the depths of the Great Recession in 2008-9. It was paced by a net loss of 459 000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector. The tally marks a stunningly abrupt end to a landmark stretch of job creation — 113 months in a row  more than twice the previous record. The gains began in late 2010 and totaled 22.2 million in an expansion that was steady  if not always spectacular. The near decade of resurgent hiring more than recouped the 8.7 million jobs wiped out in the recession that came just before. For corporations  the last 10 years were a golden age. With interest rates low  many companies binged on debt even as they used excess cash to buy back stock. For workers  the results were mixed  with only modest increases in wages  especially for those in lower-paid jobs. In the last few years  monthly hiring picked up  pushing the unemployment rate to a half-century low  including a 3.5 percent reading in February. The coronavirus pandemic changed all that. The closing of everything from restaurants and barbershops to retail stores and movie theaters eliminated broad swaths of employment in one blow  a loss only partly mitigated by vast government aid programs hurriedly enacted last month. Hiring virtually stopped in March  and nonessential businesses laid off staff as stay-at-home orders spread throughout the country. If anything  the picture has grown bleaker since the Labor Department collected the March data. “April will be markedly worse ” said Ellen Zentner  chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. “Job losses will be in the millions and will make March’s losses look tiny.” She expects the unemployment rate to peak at 16.4 percent in May  the highest level since the Labor Department began keeping track after the Great Depression. The record is 10.8 percent in November and December 1982. Ms. Zentner expects the unemployment rate to begin coming down in June but said the recovery would be slow. “The unemployment rate went up by elevator and will come down by escalator ” she said. During the long expansion  corporations were confident enough to run their operations with low inventories  lots of debt  little cash and supply lines that stretched across the globe. Without that cash cushion and that confidence  getting back to robust employment levels will not be easy  said Stephanie Pomboy  president of the independent research firm MacroMavens. “Companies saved nothing for a rainy day ” she said. “They will have a much more conservative approach to running their businesses in the future.” With most workplaces shut down  laid-off workers confront a bleak landscape  with little prospect of being hired until the pandemic lifts. One exception is in shipping and delivery  where companies are staffing up to get goods to millions of customers who can’t leave home. Amazon is in the midst of hiring 100 000 warehouse and delivery workers  and said Thursday that it had already added 80 000. Walmart and Lowe’s are filling tens of thousands of new positions. But those are rare opportunities in an economy largely frozen. “We’re in a delicate period in which a mild recession could turn into something more damaging ” said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist for Northern Trust. “Government policy must continue to be aggressive if we hope to put a floor under the current economic retreat.” The March report “represents the interruption of a very long winning streak  and sadder still  this is only the tip of the iceberg ” he said. “It’s clear from the data that those with more modest levels of education remain the most vulnerable members of our labor force. They are often the first to be laid off and often take a long time to get back to work.” The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for workers without a high school diploma rose to 6.8 percent in March from 5.7 percent in February  according to the Labor Department. Among those with at least a bachelor’s degree  joblessness rose to 2.5 percent from 1.9 percent. Mr. Tannenbaum noted that restaurants and other food-service establishments  which rely more heavily on less-educated workers  were among the businesses hit hardest as the shutdown progressed. What’s more  many of those workers can’t afford an interruption in their paychecks. Even previous shocks to the economic system  like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 or Hurricane Katrina in 2005  didn’t combine the magnitude of the job losses now underway with the pace of unfolding events. “The speed of the job losses is unlike anything we’ve ever seen ” said Gabriel Mathy  an assistant professor at American University whose specialty is economic history. “We’re in uncharted waters.” The feverish crush to file unemployment claims crashed government websites and caused those calling unemployment offices to endure hourslong waits on hold or persistent busy signals. For workers like Jane Bunting  March was a transitional month between employment and unemployment. A member of the national touring company of “Come From Away ” a Broadway musical  she watched as one venue after another canceled show dates as March wore on. She received her last payment on Thursday and has been trying to file for unemployment benefits this week  only to see the website crash on every attempt. Ms. Bunting gave up her apartment in New York City when the show’s tour began a year and a half ago and is holed up in a rental place in upstate New York. “I’ve been saving really aggressively  so I feel comfortable ” she said. “I haven’t had to dip into savings yet. But the longer this goes on  I definitely will.” The show’s run has been canceled through early May  but Ms. Bunting is hoping the curtain rises soon after. “Of course I want to go back to work as soon as possible  but if people need to stay out longer to flatten the curve  then I completely understand ” she said. Megan-Claire Chase  who learned last week that Friday would be her final day as a marketing project manager at EmployBridge  a national staffing agency based in Atlanta  knows the anxiety of losing a job. “I was laid off in the recession in 2008 ” she said  “so this is a nightmare.” For Ms. Chase  43  the loss is more unnerving now. “I’m a cancer survivor  so all of a sudden to be without my benefits is very scary ” she said. Ms. Chase is supposed to undergo checks every six months to make sure she is still in remission. As soon as she heard the layoff news  she called to reschedule one scan for this week  but was not able to get an appointment. “It’s very scary as a single person ” Ms. Chase said. One of 300 people at her firm who were laid off  she has to wait until after her last day of work to file for unemployment benefits. “I realized I’m actually grieving — the loss of my jobs  the loss of my benefits — and it’s not anything that I did ” she said. As bad as the layoffs have been  some executives are trying their best to avoid staff reductions. Tom Gimbel  chief executive of LaSalle Network  a Chicago staffing firm  is forgoing his salary through the second quarter of the year and potentially longer  he said. Business is down 25 percent  and he anticipates that it could ultimately be off 35 percent. He has been holding all-hands meetings with his employees at 10 a.m. daily with the online conferencing app Zoom. The market for permanent positions is very weak  he said  but the temporary-staffing business is holding up a bit better. “There are no profits right now ” Mr. Gimbel said. “But we’ve avoided layoffs so far.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

By Tejal Rao LOS ANGELES — For over a decade  Jennifer Field Piette has put together boxes of local fruits  vegetables and various pantry staples from California — Koda Farms rice  pale blue pastured eggs  crusty loaves of sourdough — and delivered them to people’s doorsteps in Los Angeles. Three weeks ago  the customer base for her business  Narrative Food  leapt from 85 people a week to 185. A week later  that number shot up to about 350. “I think there’s a wake-up call going on  in terms of food systems ” Ms. Piette said. “I hope it’s not a blip.” The potential danger of a crowded supermarket during the coronavirus pandemic  for both shoppers and workers  and the fragility of the industrial food supply  have people all over the city frantically looking for reliable  low-contact or no-contact groceries. For those who can afford the weekly cost of a subscription  specialized services like Narrative Food (where charges start at $43 for a box of vegetables) are increasingly popular. Farms around Los Angeles are also rising to the occasion  adopting more direct distribution models for local  seasonal foods in a time of crisis. Thao Family Farms  a small farm in Fresno that usually sells its specialty produce to restaurants  including the Culver City Tex-Mex destination Amacita  and at local farmers’ markets  is among many now packing up prepaid boxes. The boxes help make up for the farm’s lost business  and get home cooks what they urgently need. For $40  shoppers can order a mix of sprouting broccoli  Shanghai bok choy  green garlic  Chinese mustard greens  fennel and more  then pick it up at a handful of markets and restaurants across the city. The vegetable box is just one of the items on the Middle Eastern restaurant Kismet’s new grocery menu  along with wine and beer. Underwood Family Farms in Ventura County has started shipping produce boxes anywhere in the United States except Hawaii  via FedEx — this week’s are full of black kale  purple carrots  unripe avocados and tangerines. But some shoppers are prepaying and driving to the farm  then waiting safely in their car with the trunk popped open  while the food is dispatched. At the Altadena Farmers’ Market  people can place all of their orders online  picking and choosing among local cheeses  honeys and other foods from a number of vendors for curbside pickup  in a kind of custom-built  no-contact community-supported agriculture  or C.S.A. The market’s new menu also includes an $18 donation of fresh citrus  berries and vegetables that goes directly to seniors who live nearby. Though plenty of grocery stores  including Albertsons  Vons and Whole Foods Markets  have reserved shopping hours for older people and those with compromised immune systems  many of them don’t feel safe making the trip  handling items in the aisles  or even paying. “I’ve had regular clients just redirect their subscriptions to their elderly parents ” Ms. Piette said. And at a time when Amazon and Instacart workers are walking off the job in fear and in protest  and both food and delivery workers are on the front lines of the pandemic  people are eager to know who is working behind the scenes  and under what conditions. Joy Brooks is an owner  and the operations manager  of Sublime Delivery Service  a small courier company in Southern California that works with about 20 drivers  delivering food  pharmaceuticals and other necessities. She said she is looking to hire at least 10 more drivers in the coming weeks to keep up with demand. Ms. Brooks makes many of the deliveries herself. Last Sunday  she and her team dropped more than 300 food boxes around Los Angeles  from Beverly Hills and Santa Clarita to Cypress Park and Pasadena. “Right now  food deliveries are our highest demand ” she said  referring both to the provisions boxes from Narrative Food and to meal kits. As more restaurants close  small food producers lose their regular orders  and Ms. Piette is scheduling more pickups to get that food to home cooks  including bread from Bub and Grandma’s  and fresh noodles from Semolina Artisanal Pasta. “You don’t usually quintuple your volume in a few days ” said Ms. Piette  who was racing to keep up. At the company’s commercial kitchen space in Chatsworth  in the San Fernando Valley  where workers packed boxes  one staffer was now entirely dedicated to enforcing distance between employees  frequent hand-washing  sanitizing and other crucial hygiene practices. Meanwhile  the orders for more produce boxes  and more local foods  kept coming in. “I wish it wasn’t a tragedy that was changing things ” Ms. Piette said.

It’s part of a game meant to entertain children (and adults) during a prolonged period of lockdowns and social distancing. How many can you spot?, Supported by See that stuffed animal in the window? It’s part of a game meant to entertain children (and adults) during a prolonged period of lockdowns and social distancing. How many can you spot? By Jacey Fortin With her school closed  her city quiet and her country under lockdown  Stevie-Lee Tiller  13  is stuck at home with her parents and three siblings. Stevie-Lee  who lives in Hamilton  New Zealand  misses her friends at school. She is a little scared of the coronavirus because her father  a factory supervisor  is still going to work. She belongs to a close-knit extended family  but she can’t see most of her relatives in person. So she and her cousins have found a new way to be together  at least in spirit. They’re playing the same game in separate neighborhoods: the teddy bear hunt. The game is being played in countries around the world  from Australia to Japan to the United States. It’s like a scavenger hunt suited for social distancing: People put teddy bears and other stuffed animals in windows  on porches  in trees and on parked cars. Then  children go for walks or drives with their families and try to spot as many as they can. On most days  Stevie-Lee goes bear hunting with her mother and two younger sisters. “It’s really exciting when you walk past  because there are so many different bears ” she said. “There’s little ones  and some are  like  massive. There’s stuff like emoji pillows  and there’s Minions.” Her favorite sighting so far was a large white teddy bear that someone had propped up on a balcony. Stevie-Lee’s cousins Elijah Horsburgh  8  and Avah Horsburgh  5  have been keeping count of the animals they see; so far  their biggest tally for a single walk was 68. Avah’s favorite sighting was a stuffed unicorn. Elijah’s was a stuffed kiwi  the flightless bird that is an unofficial emblem of New Zealand. “It’s really fun because you have to go hunting  and you have to walk slowly so you can find it ” Elijah said. “It started as something fun to do while taking the kids out for a walk: How many bears can we spot today?” said Annelee Scott  44  Elijah and Avah’s mother. “But it’s so much more than that now. It’s helping people get through a really scary time. A lot of people are struggling with feeling anxious  alone and sad.” You don’t need a stuffed animal to participate. Some people have tacked up drawings of teddy bears instead of using the real thing. Others have taped rainbows or green shamrocks to their windows  or scrawled messages in chalk on sidewalks. The game seems to have been partly inspired by the 1989 children’s book “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt ” written by Michael Rosen and illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. In it  some children who say they are “not scared” push through tall grass  swim across a river  squelch through mud  stumble through a forest  trudge through a snowstorm and tiptoe into a cave. Finally  they find a real  live bear! Then they run home. Mr. Rosen has watched his work make its way into the real world. On social media  he shared photos from people who were going on bear hunts of their own. But Mr. Rosen  who lives with his family in London  according to his publisher  could not be reached this week. He had been feeling sick with chills  fever and fatigue. “Even my eyelids complaining they’re tired ” he wrote on Twitter last week. “Every other muscle from toes to scalp shouting  And me. And me. And me. And me.” Mr. Rosen  who did not say on Twitter what illness he had  was admitted to a hospital a few days ago. “He does know you’ve all been rooting for him with this lovely wave of support ” his wife  Emma-Louise Williams  tweeted on Tuesday. In recent weeks  stuffed animals have been spotted in at least 13 countries — including Japan  Australia  Germany and Scotland — and in all 50 states  according to data compiled by Tammy Buman  12  and Addy Buman  8. At their home in Norwoodville  Iowa  Tammy and Addy put pushpins on maps to keep track of teddy bear sightings around the world  which they monitor on social media with help from their parents  Julia Buman  34  and Ryan Buman  39. (Ms. Buman runs a Facebook group where people share photos of their bear-spotting adventures.) When the sisters were younger  their parents used to read Mr. Rosen’s book to them. So the stuffed-animal hunt brings back memories. “It’s like the bear hunt book  but it’s not just bears ” Tammy said. “I think that it helps people get their mind off of what’s happening right now.” The Bumans have put up several stuffed animals in and around their home  including a brown hobbyhorse named Sticky  who is perched in a tree outside. At Elijah and Avah’s home in New Zealand  there is a bear in the window wearing a bright red coat and a royal blue hat. His name is Paddington.

By Kai Schultz and Bhadra Sharma NEW DELHI — Ana Pautler  a trekker from San Francisco  was partway up a Himalayan mountain trail in Nepal when she noticed something peculiar: People were turning around. As fears of the coronavirus spread around the world  German hikers told Ms. Pautler on March 17 that their embassy had advised them to return to Kathmandu  the capital  and was discussing flying people out. Israeli tourists were doing the same thing  she said  spurred on by messages to leave. But Ms. Pautler  32  who has been living in China  received no such alert from the State Department’s travel advisory system until March 23  though she was signed up for regular updates. By that point  Nepal’s international airspace had already been closed for a day  following similar shutdowns all over the world  and her flight out had been canceled. “Other embassies seemed to be giving more information ” Ms. Pautler said in a telephone interview from Kathmandu  where she is waiting out a nationwide lockdown that will last until at least mid-April. “The U.S. Embassy wasn’t really saying anything.” While the United States struggles with surging cases of the coronavirus and life-or-death decisions in a fast imploding health care system  citizens stranded thousands of miles away fear that they may be left behind. A State Department spokesperson wrote in an email that personnel were “working tirelessly to identify transportation options for U.S. citizens seeking to return to the United States.” The State Department did not answer a question about why Americans in Nepal were notified of complications returning home later than other nations. As coronavirus cases reached one million worldwide  Americans on three continents said in interviews that government repatriation efforts had seemed slower and less certain than those of other countries  pointing to embassy social media posts and emails through the STEP program  which provides travel updates to citizens abroad. In India  American beachgoers in Goa  where many shops have closed from a 21-day lockdown  said they were rationing food as other countries loaded their citizens onto buses bound for the airport. In Ghana  Halima Mahdee  40  a student from California  said she was furious about not having been evacuated weeks ago  when South Korean and Chinese students were sent home from her study abroad program in Accra  the capital. In Peru  hundreds of Americans are still trapped  and activists warned that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding as tourists reported being forcibly evicted from hotels and unable to find medicine for critical health conditions. Diane Gallina  68  from Long Island  N.Y.  was frantically worried about her daughter  who she said was holed up alone in a hotel in Lima and feeling despondent. “She told me the Canadians got out ” she said through sobs. “How come Canada can get their people out?” Some tourists pointed out that communication had been far smoother with the embassy once it became clear that the United States was also going into lockdown mode. Parts of Europe  for instance  were initially reporting higher cases of the coronavirus than the United States  a possible reason for why they urged citizens to leave Nepal days earlier. The extraordinary challenge of evacuating Americans from far-flung corners of the world at the same time has overwhelmed diplomats. Last week  the United States Embassy in Kathmandu started posting regular updates on Facebook and organizing buses and flights to reach people in mountain towns  including those near Mount Everest base camp. But even as those messages were distributed among tourists  senior officials in Washington seemed unaware of the specifics. Asked at a news briefing on March 27 about the situation in Nepal  particularly for Americans stranded on trails leading to Mount Everest  Ian Brownlee  the State Department’s principal deputy assistant secretary in the consular affairs bureau  told a reporter he would have to get back to her. Embassies have faced daunting logistics coordinating with local government officials who are focused on protecting their own citizens. Even reaching tourists in countries like Nepal has been complicated: Some popular trails are accessible only by chartering tiny planes that hold a dozen people. At a Tuesday news briefing  President Trump said the evacuations were some of the “largest and most complex” in American history. He said the State Department had rescued more than 25 000 Americans from more than 50 countries. “Almost everybody’s out now ” Mr. Trump said  referring to those in Peru and Brazil. But in Nepal  hundreds are still stuck. Alarm bells sounded more than two weeks ago  when European nations started contacting their citizens. On March 17  as stringent lockdowns started rippling around the world  the German Embassy warned citizens of flight disruptions on their Facebook page and urged them to contact their airlines. Over the next week and a half  Germany and France organized flights to take out hundreds of people  including citizens of Finland  Austria  Denmark and Belgium. As Europeans were receiving early warnings to leave  John Arns  47  who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area  tried to get information about what the American government was doing. But all he could find on the embassy’s Facebook page was information about proper hand-washing techniques and Women’s History Month. “I am incredibly disappointed with the embassy’s response ” he said. Some Americans stuck in Nepal said they were being pointed out and called “corona” when they stepped outside of their hostels. The perception among some South Asians is that foreigners are responsible for importing the virus; Nepal has just six confirmed cases  including one person who has recovered. “The Nepalis here are afraid of us ” said Stacy Kim  58  from Santa Cruz  Calif.  who was stranded in a remote town near the country’s border with India. “When we try to buy food they are scared we are exposing them to the virus and try to get us to go away.” Even in Kathmandu  tourists said they were worried about the logistics of something as basic as reaching the airport. The police have threatened people on the streets. Raj Gyawali  who is part of a government crisis committee helping tourists during the lockdown  said the Europeans — except for the British — had been highly proactive in getting their citizens out. “To speak frankly  they seemed so organized ” he said. And the Americans? “I don’t know why they are delaying ” he said. It was not until March 26 that the State Department issued its first notice about a possible evacuation flight. Five days later  302 Americans left Nepal for Washington. In a video message  the ambassador  Randy Berry  said the flight was the result of “hundreds of hours of coordination and cooperation.” At a Tuesday news briefing  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Americans “to work your way back here ” saying he could not guarantee “the U.S. government’s ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.” But as Americans have watched medical personnel load bodies onto refrigerated trucks and the United States reports more cases than anywhere else in the world  some are having second thoughts about trying to leave on another evacuation flight. Amy Sellmyer  34  from Oklahoma  who has worked in Nepal and built a life there  felt she was better off staying put. “I’m not planning to go ” she said. Kai Schultz reported from New Delhi  and Bhadra Sharma from Kathmandu  Nepal. Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/world/03virus-tourists-1/merlin_171241920_b04d5445-9208-44c3-9bca-461e674e9b61-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Salman Masood The Pakistani authorities said Friday that four men had been rearrested in the abduction and killing of the American journalist Daniel Pearl after a court overturned their convictions just the day before. The government will appeal their acquittals to Pakistan’s Supreme Court  officials said. On Thursday the High Court in Sindh Province overturned the murder conviction of Ahmed Omar Sheikh  a high-profile British-born militant accused of masterminding the 2002 abduction and killing of Mr. Pearl. It also tossed his death sentence  reducing it to seven years  a move that would have allowed him to be freed for time served. The convictions of three other men in the case on murder and terrorism charges were also overturned. The court decision was widely condemned by American officials and journalists’ groups. Welcoming Pakistan’s move to appeal on Friday  a senior State Department official said  “The overturning of the convictions for Daniel Pearl’s murder is an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere.” The official  Alice G. Wells  added  “Those responsible for Daniel’s heinous kidnapping and murder must face the full measure of justice.” The Pakistani Interior Ministry said Friday in a statement that the men’s release was halted after they were rearrested through a measure allowing the government to hold suspects for three months. The ministry said it “reiterates its commitment to follow due process under the laws of the country to bring terrorists to task.” Officials said the release of the four men could create a serious problem with law and order. Mr. Pearl  a reporter for The Wall Street Journal  was abducted and killed in 2002 in the southern port city of Karachi while he was working on an investigation about militant groups’ links to Al Qaeda. The Sindh High Court had ruled that there was sufficient evidence against Mr. Sheikh in Mr. Pearl’s abduction but not his killing. Pakistani officials said an appeal would be filed next week in the Supreme Court. American officials have said they believe Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  accused of masterminding the attacks of Sept. 11  2001  personally carried out Mr. Pearl’s murder.

By Shane Goldmacher Pete Buttigieg  who rose from obscurity to narrowly win the Iowa caucuses before dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary last month  has taken some of the first steps toward outlining his post-campaign future. Mr. Buttigieg  the former mayor of South Bend  Ind.  is forming both a political action committee  called Win the Era  and an affiliated nonprofit group  according to people briefed on the plans. Donors have been told that the PAC will support and endorse candidates who represent generational change  specifically in down-ballot races  in hopes of helping to create a “pipeline” for the party. The groups will also promote issues such as climate change and cybersecurity. A skeletal version of a website that refashions Mr. Buttigieg’s 2020 logo  replacing the word “Pete” with “Win the Era ” is already online  though it has not been advertised. “There is simply too much at stake to retreat to the sidelines now ” the site reads. “Together we can build the era that must come next.” Mr. Buttigieg  whose second term as mayor ended Jan. 1  is just 38 and seen as one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party. But he also finds himself out of office and with no clear path back to electoral politics in Republican-dominated Indiana. He emerged as one of the surprise fund-raising standouts of the 2020 campaign  raising more than $100 million in a little more than a year. He won over traditional fund-raisers  from Wall Street to Silicon Valley  who had bundled huge sums for President Barack Obama  as well as small online contributors. He raised more than $43 million from donors who gave less than $200. His primary campaign committee ended up with at least $2.8 million in general election funds  according to calculations by the Campaign Finance Institute. Because Mr. Buttigieg did not become the nominee  that money must now be refunded. But Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign is now asking donors to instead redirect the money to seed the PAC  which can accept contributions of up to $5 000 each. “The work of electing a forward-thinking generation of Democratic candidates never ends ” said Lis Smith  a spokeswoman for Mr. Buttigieg and a senior adviser to his campaign  when asked about his plans. “Pete will do his part by building and leading the Win the Era PAC as we get closer to the November election.” Updated April 13  2020  Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/us/politics/03buttigieg-pac/merlin_169775097_91d9768d-0aac-4522-a2e0-fbd1024827a1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/multimedia/author-shane-goldmacher/author-shane-goldmacher-thumbLarge.png

She died of the coronavirus., Supported by those we’ve lost She gave up the stage for the writing life  publishing biographies of some famous friends and two powerful memoirs. She died of the coronavirus. By Elsa Dixler This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Patricia Bosworth  who gave up acting for the writing life  turning her knowledge of the theater into a series of biographies and mining her own extraordinary life for a pair of powerful memoirs  died on Thursday in Manhattan. She was 86. Her stepdaughter  Fia Hatsav  said the cause was complications of pneumonia brought on by the coronavirus. Ms. Bosworth had some success as an actress. She was admitted to the Actors Studio in its glory days  learning method acting alongside Marlon Brando and Marilyn Monroe. She won some important roles onstage and appeared alongside Audrey Hepburn on film. But she always wanted to write  and she found material in the many friendships she had cultivated with luminaries in Hollywood  the theater world and elsewhere — Brando  Montgomery Clift and the photographer Diane Arbus among them. She became a successful journalist as well  as an editor and writer for several publications. She was a contributing editor at Vanity Fair for many years. Ms. Bosworth’s best subject  and the one that underlay most of her work  was her own eventful life. She explored it in “Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story” (1997)  which centers on her charismatic father  a lawyer who defended two of the Hollywood Ten in the postwar anti-Communist hysteria and saw his career destroyed by the blacklist; and “The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan” (2017)  about her coming-of-age and emergence as a writer. Suicide haunted her. Her father  who had long abused barbiturates and alcohol  killed himself  on his second try  in 1959. And her beloved younger brother shot himself in his dorm room at Reed College in Oregon in 1953  tormented by depression and conflicted over his homosexuality. The subjects of Ms. Bosworth’s biographies were either suicides (Arbus)  survivors of a relative’s suicide (Jane Fonda) or flamboyantly self-destructive (Clift  Brando). She explained that writing these books was “one of the ways I coped with and tried to understand why the two men I loved most in the world had decided to kill themselves.” But as challenging as it may have been  Ms. Bosworth’s life was hardly grim. Patricia Crum was born into privilege on April 24  1933  in San Francisco  the daughter of Bartley Cavanaugh Crum and Anna Bosworth Crum  who was known as Cutsie. Her mother was a former crime reporter who wrote several novels  among them “Strumpet Wind” (1938). Her father  who was known as Bart  encouraged Patricia’s acting aspirations  and it was he who advised her to take her mother’s maiden name — depriving future critics of the chance  as she put it  to castigate a “crummy performance by Patricia Crum.” During Ms. Bosworth’s childhood  her father practiced law in San Francisco and served as an adviser to the liberal-leaning internationalist Wendell Willkie in his Republican presidential campaign in 1940 and for some years after. In her first memoir  Ms. Bosworth remembered her parents as glamorous figures  always leaving for parties or throwing them  their living room crowded with celebrities. But there were shadows behind the California sunlight. Her mother  feeling abandoned by her constantly traveling husband  had affairs; her father’s heartfelt liberalism would run athwart of the postwar Red Scare. More than one reviewer of “Anything Your Little Heart Desires” compared the Crums’ story to an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Mr. Crum’s decline followed his defense of members of the Hollywood Ten  who had refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee in its attempt to root out suspected Communists in the movie industry. His corporate clients disappeared. He moved the family to New York  where he purchased the left-wing newspaper PM and tried to turn it around as The New York Star. The attempt failed  and he became despondent  worried about money and harassed by the F.B.I. Mr. Crum eventually joined a Wall Street law firm and attracted celebrity clients. He represented Rita Hayworth  for one  in her divorce from the playboy Prince Aly Kahn. Ms. Bosworth  then a star-struck teenager  met another client  Montgomery Clift  lounging in the family living room. She kept one of his cigarette butts for the rest of her life. Enrolling at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville  N.Y.  Ms. Bosworth  in her first semester  impetuously married a fortune-hunting art student she had known for six weeks. He quickly became psychologically and physically abusive  she later wrote. Ms. Bosworth’s parents paid her tuition  but she was left to support her husband and his grandmother. While continuing her classes  she began to model  landing a national campaign for Prell shampoo. It was as a model that she met and formed a bond with Diane Arbus  who at the time was assisting her husband  the fashion photographer Allan Arbus. Her brief marriage over  Ms. Bosworth graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1955 and auditioned for the acting teacher Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio; her acceptance  she later said  was “one of the high points of my life.” The studio  the birthplace of method acting  was in its heyday. In addition to Monroe and Brando  fellow members included Paul Newman  Elaine Stritch  Ben Gazzara and Steve McQueen  who took her for a ride on his motorcycle. The studio crackled with erotic energy  and in the mid-’50s the casting couch was an accepted furnishing. Ms. Bosworth was castin “Blue Denim ” directed by Arthur Penn  at the Westport Playhouse in Connecticut in 1955. Among other roles  she went on to play Laura in “The Glass Menagerie” at the Palm Beach Playhouse in Florida in 1956 (“the high point of my acting career”) and a character based on Nora Ephron in “Howie ” a 1959 play by Nora’s mother  Phoebe Ephron. As a film actress Ms. Bosworth played a young nun  the best friend of Audrey Hepburn’s title character  in “The Nun’s Story” (1959). Ms. Bosworth ended her adventurous decade by marrying Mel Arrighi  a playwright and novelist  in 1966. They were together until his death in 1986. She began writing during those years  contributing articles about theater to The New York Times and New York magazine. In time she worked as an editor at McCall’s  Harper’s Bazaar  Mirabella and Vanity Fair magazines. Ms. Bosworth’s first book was “Montgomery Clift: A Biography ” published in 1978. Rosalyn Drexler  writing in The Times  praised Ms. Bosworth’s “total immersion in the subject as well as her artistry.” When “Diane Arbus: A Biography” appeared in 1984  the Times critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt acclaimed it as “detailed and balanced” as well as “highly intelligent.” (The book was the basis of a 2006 film  “Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus ” starring Nicole Kidman.) Ms. Bosworth moved on to “Marlon Brando ” a book in the Penguin Lives series  in 2001  and later to “Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman” (2011)  a best seller. Ms. Bosworth had first met Ms. Fonda when they were both students at the Actors Studio. Ms. Bosworth told Publishers Weekly that in “Jane Fonda” she had tried to write as much a cultural history as a biography  to give context to Ms. Fonda’s ever-evolving career. “In the 10 years I took to write her biography  I observed many Janes ” she wrote in an essay for The Times in 2011. “I saw the Jane with the agenda; the girlish  self-effacing Jane when she’s with men; the armchair shrink Jane who spouts advice about sex and love and exercise as if by rote whenever she’s on TV; the ruthless  hard-as-nails Jane in business and self-promotion; the generous Jane with friends in need; the loving grandmother-matriarch Jane; the celebrity Jane who in May walked down the red carpet at Cannes in a glittery white gown and left all the young starlets in her dust.” Creating a biography  Ms. Bosworth wrote on her website  was “like solving a mystery  always looking for clues.” Elegantly  and without self-pity or sentimentality  she eventually turned her attention to the mystery of her own life. Her first memoir  “Anything Your Little Heart Desires ” was also a cultural history  backed by prodigious research  as it followed her father’s life from his high-powered law career in San Francisco to his radicalization by the general strike of 1934 and his involvement in left-wing causes. Ms. Bosworth’s second memoir  “The Men in My Life ” covered her 20s  from 1953 to 1963. It is both the story of a survivor who struggles with the suicides of her father and brother and an entertaining account of her sexual awakening and life among actors in New York. In addition to her stepdaughter  Ms. Bosworth is survived by her partner  Douglas Schwalbe; a stepson  Léo Palumbo; and five step-grandchildren. She taught literary nonfiction at Columbia University and Barnard College and for some years ran the Playwright-Directors Unit at the Actors Studio. Her final book  “Protest Song: Paul Robeson  J. Edgar Hoover  and the Ongoing Fight for Racial Equality ” is to be published by Farrar  Straus & Giroux next year. Julia Carmel contributed reporting.

He died of the coronavirus., Supported by those we’ve lost An independent-minded jurist  he oversaw the World Trade Center bombing trial and another involving a plot to down jetliners. He died of the coronavirus. By Joseph P. Fried This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Kevin Thomas Duffy  a federal judge who presided over decades of high-profile trials in Manhattan  including those of mob bosses  radical revolutionaries and the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993  died on Wednesday in Greenwich  Conn. He was 87. A longtime colleague and friend  P. Kevin Castel  said the cause was Covid-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus. Judge Duffy died in Greenwich Hospital and lived in that town. Judge Duffy is probably most widely remembered for presiding at the trial of the Islamic militants who were convicted in the 1993 attack on the trade center. He also oversaw another trial in the 1990s involving an aborted plot to blow up as many as a dozen American airliners over the Pacific Ocean. In the 1970s  he heard a prolonged  contentious case over cleaning up New York City’s air; and in the ’90s he presided in an emotional clash over the exclusion of an Irish gay and lesbian group from the line of march in the city’s annual St. Patrick’s Day parade. In handling these and thousands of other criminal and civil matters over almost 40 years  Judge Duffy gained a reputation for being colorful and often controversial in the courtroom  displaying an independent  even defiant streak and delivering unvarnished comments from the bench. He would sometimes compliment jurors on their apparel. He once referred to a prosecutor as “that obnoxious little twerp.” In another case  an appeals court threw out a verdict because it said that the judge’s comments before the jury — including calling a lawyer’s questions “silly” and “goofy” — might have prejudiced the jurors against the lawyer’s client  who lost the case. After one of the six men convicted in the 1993 trade center attack maintained at his sentencing that he had not been involved in the bombing — in an underground garage  killing six people — Judge Duffy called him an “out-and-out” liar and declared  “The others were low  you’re even lower.” When Ramzi Ahmed Yousef  who was convicted of directing the bombing  asserted that terrorism was the only viable response to American policies toward Palestinian and other Muslim people  Judge Duffy read passages from the Quran showing  he said  that “your God is not Allah.” “Death was truly your God  your master  your one and only religion ” he said. The judge sentenced Mr. Yousef to life in prison plus 240 years. He sentenced the five other conspirators to 240 years each  though an appeals court later said that he had erred in setting the terms for four of the five men  and he resentenced them to 108 to 117 years each. In another trial before Judge Duffy  Mr. Yousef and two other men were convicted of plotting to blow up jetliners over the Pacific. Because of his involvement in those terrorism cases  the judge had round-the-clock security for about a decade. Judge Duffy also presided in 1983 at one of the several Brink’s robbery and murder trials stemming from the 1981 shootout between the police and Black Liberation Army and other radicals in Rockland County  N.Y.  in which a guard and two officers were killed. The trials led to several convictions. And in 1985 he oversaw the trial of Paul Castellano  the reputed head of the Gambino organized crime family  who was assassinated outside Sparks Steak House in Manhattan after the trial had begun. Some lawyers considered Judge Duffy unduly tough in meting out sentences. For his part  he made it clear that he favored wide discretion in sentencing. In a 1987 decision  as federal sentencing rules that limited the discretion of judges were about to take effect  he criticized people who  as he put it  wanted sentences to be imposed by “a mindless robot  automaton or computer.” Kevin Thomas Duffy  who preferred using his full middle name  was born in the Bronx on Jan. 10  1933  to Patrick and Mary (McGarrell) Duffy. His father was a carpenter  his mother a homemaker. After earning bachelor’s and law degrees from Fordham University  he was an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan and a lawyer in private practice. In September 1972  he was the administrator of the New York regional office of the Securities and Exchange Commission when President Richard M. Nixon nominated him to the United States Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Duffy married Irene Krumeich in 1957. She was a judge with the New York State Family Court and also served in the Criminal Court and the New York Supreme Court. She survives him  as do a daughter  Irene Moira Lueling; two sons  Kevin Jr. and Gavin; two sisters  Marie Heslin and Patricia McKeon; and eight grandchildren. His son Patrick died in 2017. Judge Duffy also had a home in Southampton  N.Y. One of the most drawn-out cases overseen by Judge Duffy was the 1970s battle involving New York City’s air quality. Environmental groups contended that the administrations of Gov. Hugh L. Carey and Mayor Abraham D. Beame had failed to enforce a pollution-reducing plan — including the imposition of tolls on East River bridges to discourage traffic — to which previous state and city administrations had agreed. Mayor Beame called the plan questionable and too costly. In two early rulings in the case  Judge Duffy declined to order the city to comply with the plan. But after an appeals court directed him to issue enforcement orders  the case became one of seemingly endless strife. At one point  Judge Duffy threatened to hold Governor Carey in contempt if he failed to meet one of the judge’s deadlines. The case ended without contempt proceedings and with the toll provision scrapped. In the case of the St. Patrick’s Day parade  Judge Duffy ruled in 1993 that the parade’s sponsor  a Roman Catholic fraternal order  had a constitutional right as a private organization to bar the gay and lesbian group from marching. The United States Supreme Court later issued a similar decision in a parallel case involving Boston’s St. Patrick’s Day parade. In addressing jurors before one of the World Trade Center trials  Judge Duffy provided some insight into his courtroom manner  suggesting that his informality was intended to make jurors feel at ease. None of the trial participants would be allowed to use a word longer than “delicatessen ” he said  because legal matters should be expressed in language simple enough for everybody  including himself  to understand. Julia Carmel contributed reporting. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/obituaries/01Duffy/01Duffy-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale 
03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-congress-voting.html, opinion, What Happens if Congress Cannot Assemble to Do Its Work?, As Covid-19 makes social distancing a matter of life and death  a growing number of lawmakers are pushing the idea of remote voting., Supported by As Covid-19 makes social distancing a matter of life and death  a growing number of lawmakers are pushing the idea of remote voting. By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise  research  debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. Before the coronavirus crisis gets better  it will get worse: more death  more economic pain — and therefore more need for Congress to adopt relief measures for the American people. But what if the pandemic reaches the point where lawmakers are simply unable to reconvene in Washington because of a complete shutdown of travel? What if the capital region becomes so inundated with illness that it makes return too risky? What if members return and start falling ill  setting off a domino effect? Already  six lawmakers are known to have come down with Covid-19. Especially in the Senate  where nearly half the members are age 65 or older  the potential for disaster is high. Hypotheticals aside  it makes no sense for hundreds of lawmakers and aides to be zipping across the country as travel restrictions are tightened and Americans are ordered not to leave their homes. At what point does it become unacceptably dangerous  from a public-health and a public-duty perspective  for Congress to assemble in person during a pandemic? These sorts of questions have been driving a growing number of lawmakers to agitate for an emergency system of remote voting. With the rest of America struggling to adapt to the new reality of social distancing  it is time for Congress to get serious about the issue. On March 23  as the Coronavirus Aid  Relief  and Economic Security Act was being hammered out  67 House Democrats asked the House Rules Committee to issue a temporary rule change enabling members to vote remotely during an emergency. This would not only reduce the risk of contagion  they argued  but it also would allow lawmakers already in quarantine to participate. Their letter came four days after Senator Rob Portman  Republican of Ohio  and Senator Dick Durbin  Democrat of Illinois  introduced a resolution calling for such a system in the upper chamber. “In times of a national emergency  the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person ” Mr. Portman said  announcing the measure. But both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  have rejected the idea. “That’s one of the few things that the speaker of the House and I agree on ” Mr. McConnell said in a March 31 interview with Fox News Radio. Ms. Pelosi has expressed operational and constitutional concerns about setting up such a system  while Mr. McConnell maintains that there is no need to upend the way the Senate has operated for the past two centuries. Under pressure from her members  last month Ms. Pelosi asked the chairman of the House Rules Committee to study the issue. A March 23 report by the committee’s majority staff laid out a number of potential challenges to remote voting. Most of them boiled down to: Change is hard. Objections typically fall into a handful of categories. Logistics. How would a remote system of debate and voting work? How would members register their votes? How could you make sure lawmakers were not under duress during voting? Advocates of remote voting acknowledge that many details would need to be hammered out but stress that such challenges aren’t insurmountable. Technology and security. Citing both hacking and the potential for glitches  skeptics warn of the unreliability of a remote system. Robust protections would of course need to be adopted. The necessary pieces of the technology already exist  industry experts say  even if it would take time (and money) to build and battle-test a robust system. Constitutionality. While there is some discussion about whether constitutional references to “meeting” and “attendance” could be interpreted to require lawmakers to conduct business in person  many constitutional scholars have noted that the founding fathers explicitly left it up to each chamber to “determine the rules of its proceedings.” The slippery slope. Traditionalists fear that once you make it possible for lawmakers to conduct vital business remotely  it will be hard to herd them back to the Capitol  eroding the deliberative nature of legislating. In the regular course of affairs  face-to-face negotiations and floor debates are indeed valuable. What is under discussion now is how to keep Congress functioning in extremely irregular conditions  when close interaction could prove dangerous for members and the public. The resolution from Mr. Portman and Mr. Durbin requires lawmakers to reauthorize any emergency voting system every 30 days. Already  state legislatures have begun grappling with the issue. Pennsylvania lawmakers were early adopters. In late March  both chambers held sessions in which a majority of members voted remotely. The shortcomings of some of the less dramatic alternatives that the Rules Committee cited  such as passing legislation by unanimous consent or a voice vote — neither of which requires members to gather on the House floor — were on display during the passage of the phase-three relief package. A lone Republican  Thomas Massie of Kentucky  blew up the process by demanding a roll-call vote. This forced scores of his colleagues to put their lives at risk to return to Washington and pile into the House chamber to override his petty stunt. Three days later  one of those members  Nydia Velázquez  Democrat of New York  announced that she had received a diagnosis of a “presumed coronavirus infection.” There has to be a better  safer way for Congress to conduct the people’s business under extraordinary conditions.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic.html, opinion, There Is No Way Out but Through, We are connected to one another and to generations past and future., Supported by We are connected to one another and to generations past and future. By Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist My sister  who lives in London  has been passing lockdown time going through old slides of my father’s  discovered last year. Every now and then she sends me a grainy or mildewed photograph  a message in a bottle from across the ocean. The pandemic has prompted a universal time of reflection. The past  more present  is the new field of exploration  absent movement. There we are  my sister and I  still in the cocoon of innocence  happy  curious  with my mother mainly  my father occasionally  my grandparents. Everyone but us in the photographs is now dead. My parents  all those South African aunts and uncles  that world  gone. The dead feel much closer now  along with all those things they lived  the Depression  the war  confinement. Ships drift around the world with unwanted people  like the Jewish refugees aboard the MS St. Louis on its voyage of the damned on the eve of World War II. The virus teaches something forgotten  what it is like to be swept away by the gale of history  what it is for every assumption to collapse  what is precious in each single contemplated breath. It is said the camera never lies. But behind those smiles in my dad’s slides lay family tragedy. When I researched my grandparents’ history in Lithuania and gazed at photographs of the Jewish life there that would be extinguished I recall thinking: You  sir  are doomed — and you on the wagon  and you with a hand on your horse’s withers. Roland Barthes observed that in every old photograph lurks catastrophe. Yet I feel more connection than catastrophe. To my family  to everyone out there looking backward and inward  sifting memories  adjusting priorities. Less is more. Old recipes revived  old purses reopened and redolent of a grandmother’s apartment  old rhythms of life in a small radius rediscovered. It’s the end of an era. The virus kills — to what degree is still unclear. It also screams  you must change your life. The world that emerges from this cannot resemble the old. If this plague that cares not a whit for the class or status of its victims cannot teach solidarity over individualistic excess  nothing will. If this continent-hopping pathogen cannot demonstrate the precarious interconnectedness of the planet  nothing will. Unlike 9/11  the assault is universal. Yet the two most powerful men on earth  President Xi Jinping of China and President Trump  have responded with petty national interest that has cost myriad lives. They have failed the world  a superpower debacle. China covered up the initial coronavirus outbreak in December for several weeks and then tried to divert attention from its biological Chernobyl through trumpeting its success in containing the illness (the numbers remain dubious)  offering international assistance (some in the form of defective masks and tests)  and propagating the wild conspiracy theory that the plague did not start in Wuhan but was cooked up in an American military lab and delivered by the United States team attending the Military World Games in Wuhan last October. The lesson is not  as China would have it  that despotic regimes deal more effectively with disaster but that they incubate the fear that made it impossible for doctors and authorities in Wuhan to communicate rapidly the scale of the threat. A series of tweets last month from the Chinese Embassy in France lauding China’s and Asia’s superior response to the virus due to the “sense of community and citizenship that Western democracies lack” was grotesque. Li Wenliang  who died in February  and Ai Fen  who appears to have disappeared  are the whistleblower doctors of Wuhan whom humanity must never forget. Trump tweeted on March 29  as Americans died  that “President Trump is a ratings hit.” His daily Covid-19 reality TV show  which he called his “coronavirus updates ” had “an astounding number” of viewers  “more akin to the viewership for a popular prime-time sitcom.” If you want a quick definition of obscenity  that’s it. This is the mentality  or rather the mental affliction  that compounded the Chinese cover-up with a Trump-authored American confabulation that lost another six weeks in dismissal of the pandemic as a hoax. The world is leaderless. Every country for itself. Swirling in lies and rumors. Schoolyard petulance  like Mike Pompeo  the worst American secretary of state in a long time  insisting on calling this coronavirus “the Wuhan virus.” This is Trump’s world  and Xi’s. It is hard now  here in New York  everywhere really. Reading the numbers. Trying to make sense of them. Seeing the triage tents and portable morgues. Watching small businesses close. The millions suddenly without jobs. The people dying alone  without their loved ones because of the risk of infection. Discarded blue and white latex gloves on a street. Insomnia. Choppers over the city at night. The Zoom gatherings that console but also recall that touch is beyond technology. The way people veer away from a passer-by  the coronavirus swerve. The sirens. The silence that makes the sirens louder. All this has happened before  not quite like this  but yes. My sister’s photographs are also a memento mori. And the world has come through. Because of people like Craig Smith  the surgeon in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital who wrote of Covid-19 patients in a moving dispatch to his medical troops  “They survive because we don’t give up.” It’s coming apart. Take care of it. We don’t give up. We are connected to one another and to generations past and future. There are no strangers here.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-future.html, opinion, Covid-19: A Look Back From 2025, In which the coronavirus has changed almost everything., Supported by In which the coronavirus has changed almost everything. By Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist Jan. 19  2025 When Covid-19 first emerged as a health crisis in China five years ago  observers noted that authoritarian regimes — with their hostility toward whistle-blowers  their manipulation of data  their fear of the free flow of information — facilitate the spread of disease. Within a few months  it became clear that the flip side of that proposition was also true: Disease facilitates the spread of authoritarianism. In Hungary  the virus was the pretext for Prime Minister Viktor Orban to establish a dictatorship on the model of Vladimir Putin’s Russia. In the Philippines  President Rodrigo Duterte used the pandemic to issue shoot-to-kill orders against political protesters. In Israel  the government’s decision to use cellphone data to track the movements of infected individuals quickly became a model and alibi for other states to pick up the practice  with no scruples about the data they collected. It didn’t stop there. The pandemic provided a ready-made excuse for democratic governments around the world to obstruct opposition parties  ban public assemblies  suppress voting  quarantine cities  close borders  limit trade  strong-arm businesses  impose travel restrictions and censor hostile media outlets in the name of combating “false information.” Remarkably  the tactics met with comparatively little resistance  partly because they were advertised as only temporary  and partly because the concerns of civil libertarians paled next to calls to “flatten the curve.” But as the lockdowns of 2020 were extended from spring to summer and then to early fall  a process of normalization began to take hold. In the U.S.  Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination from his Delaware home after it became clear that holding a convention would pose unacceptable health risks. Effectively barred from campaigning by restrictions on public rallies (as well as fear among his aides that the 77-year old nominee might contract the virus)  he sought to mount a virtual campaign against an incumbent who wielded the emergency powers of government to aid his re-election. Donald Trump handily won again in November. As civil liberties receded  big government grew. Unprecedented unemployment meant unprecedented increases in Medicaid rolls  jobless benefits  housing assistance and food stamps. It was left to Trump to preside over an expansion of the welfare state the likes of which Bernie Sanders could only have dreamed about a year earlier. Nor did things change much after the lockdowns were lifted  as people remained reluctant to venture into restaurants  shops and planes — and less able to afford them. Millions of business failures and personal bankruptcies translated to tens of millions of loan and mortgage delinquencies  which in turn caused a financial crisis. Dozens of banks had to be nationalized outright  while the government took stakes in every industry it rescued. By the time a safe vaccine was finally available  the damage had been done. The developing world experienced the crisis far more severely. “Flattening the curve” made little sense in countries whose medical systems were already overwhelmed and underequipped long before Covid-19 came around. Stay-at-home and social distancing orders were treated as a cruel and unenforceable joke in densely populated cities like Lagos  Cairo  Jakarta and São Paulo. People faced with hunger if they didn’t get to their jobs were prepared to take their chances with the coronavirus. The result was a frightful fatality rate  not-much mitigated by the fact that poorer countries have younger populations. Then there were effects of the global depression on the world’s most vulnerable economies. The destruction of the maquiladora industries in Mexico quickly led to the abrupt collapse of state authority along the border  a vacuum immediately filled by the cartels. By 2023 Trump had finally built his wall  backed by bipartisan congressional support. At the outset of the crisis it may have seemed that progressive parties stood to benefit politically. The opposite proved true. Environmental concerns seemed like idle luxuries when gas was cheap and CO2 emissions plummeted along with economic activity. Demands for gun control and criminal-sentencing reform fell flat in the face of increasing levels of crime. Trump’s repeated calls for getting America “back to work” resonated with rural and suburban voters  who thought they had less to fear from the virus and tended to measure personal risk differently than urban elites. A bellicose spirit also took hold. Economically damaged regimes — China  Russia and Iran especially — looked to offset domestic discontents with foreign adventures. Military enlistments rose everywhere  partly as a form of employment  partly out of a sense of fear. Among the paradoxes of the Covid-19 crisis was that it brought the world together as never before in a common experience of lockdowns and self-isolations — while fragmenting it as never before into wary states and nervous neighbors. Not everything was bleak. Adults read more books  paid closer attention to their spouses and children  called their aging parents more often  made more careful choices with their money  thought more deeply about what they really wanted in life. In time  that kind of spiritual deepening will surely pay its own dividends. For now  however  America awaits the inauguration of its 46th president  Michael Richard Pence.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/movies/library-congress-streaming-free.html, movies, Film Treasures  Streaming Courtesy of the Library of Congress, The astonishment of riches includes up-close looks at our history in hundreds of films. And they’re all free., Supported by Critic’s Notebook The astonishment of riches includes up-close looks at our history in hundreds of films. And they’re all free. By Manohla Dargis One of the world’s oldest films  “Sneeze ” is a gift that keeps on giving. Shot in 1894 and about as long as an achoo  it shows a mustachioed gent emitting a single sneeze  a kerchief clutched in one hand. The film was made by W.K.L. Dickson and the sneeze delivered by Fred Ott. Working in Thomas Edison’s New Jersey studio  they gave us the first celluloid sneeze  an open-mouth exhalation that was meant to be humorous but today seems ominous. Cover your mouth! I yelled when I looked at it again. “Sneeze” is just one of many films that you can watch for free online courtesy of the Library of Congress  which partly acquires deposits through the United States Copyright Office. The biggest library in the world  it has an extraordinary trove of online offerings — more than 7 000 videos — that includes hundreds of old (and really old) movies. With one click  you can watch Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show parade down Fifth Avenue in 1902; click again to giggle at Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse in a 1916 cartoon. And while the library is temporarily closed to the public  its virtual doors remain open. It remains one of my favorite places to get lost in. The Library of Congress was created in 1800 by the same act of Congress that moved the federal government to Washington  with a $5 000 budget for books approved by John Adams. The library was originally meant for the sole use of Congress and its role was debated over successive administrations and crises  including several catastrophic fires. By the time its first dedicated building opened in 1897  though  its status was settled: It was “the book palace of the American people ” as one librarian of Congress called it  a classification that expanded when it began adding films. “Sneeze ” a.k.a. “Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze ” is the library’s earliest surviving copyrighted motion picture and was submitted in paper form. Films weren’t protected by copyright until 1912 but photos were  so savvy producers deposited their films as paper contact prints (entire motion pictures were submitted that way). There are more than 3 000 such paper prints in the library (they’ve been turned back into films). Most were produced in the United States and open fascinating  often charming windows to earlier times whether through a Yale-Princeton football game  a New Jersey baby parade or some nuzzling in “Kiss ” the first film to show lips locking. You can sample this bounty on the Library of Congress website or through its more limited  curated selections on YouTube  where loading times seem faster. On each platform  the films are organized into playlists like the National Screening Room  a catchall that includes everything from educational films to slapstick comedies. Here’s where you can watch “Mabel and Fatty’s Wash Day” (1915)  which was co-directed by one of its stars  Mabel Normand  or dive into Pare Larentz’s “The River” (1938)  a classic about the Mississippi made for the Farm Security Administration. Here  too  is where to find Edward O. Bland’s “The Cry of Jazz” (1959)  a political scorcher about jazz that has bad acting  searing documentary imagery and terrific music (from Sun Ra  among others). The aesthetic quality of the titles varies  but that’s to the point of the library’s democratic mandate. Not all the films on deposit are exemplars of the art — although greatness abounds here — but they nevertheless have cultural and historical value. Some are flat-out weird and wonderful  while others seem like souvenirs from a distant land. That’s true of “Television ” a 1939 curio that opens with an audience seated in the dark before a tiny glowing screen that abruptly grows larger  a stark encapsulation of TV’s challenge to moviegoing. “Television now takes its place ” the narrator promises (threatens!)  “as a new American art and industry.” One of the library’s best YouTube playlists gathers together a small selection of titles from the National Film Registry. The registry is part of the library and new titles are added to it annually with the help of the National Film Preservation Board  an advisory body. The library also invites the public to nominate titles for the registry  so if you’d like to endorse Robert Aldrich’s 1964 freakout “Hush … Hush  Sweet Charlotte” you have until Sept. 15. To be eligible  a movie must be at least 10 years (so hold off on nominating “The Last Jedi”) and be “culturally  historically or aesthetically significant.” Some of the registry titles online are in so-so shape  but many look great and the painstakingly refurbished ones probably look better now than when they first played in cinemas. Most are short  which is useful if you’re having a tough time focusing on anything for very long. Mervyn LeRoy’s 10-minute nugget “The House I Live In” (1945) finds Frank Sinatra breaking up a gang of peewee thugs chasing a Jewish boy. Sinatra calls the bullies Nazis and lectures them about being good Americans. (The writer Albert Maltz  one of the Hollywood Ten  was soon blacklisted in Hollywood.) The film’s piety feels even more canned when viewed next to “In the Street” (1948)  a lyrical slice of New York life from James Agee  Helen Levitt and Janice Loeb. Among the most beautiful films in the registry playlist is the Fleischer Studios cartoon “Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor” (1936)  a gorgeous example of the work produced by this onetime Disney competitor. The story is simple — it’s the usual smackdown with boasts  quips and a can of spinach — but the film is a Technicolor marvel with liquid animation  vibrant critters and wittily choreographed bits. It’s also predictably antediluvian. “Bring me the woman ” Sindbad says with a leer to a giant purple bird  which snatches Olive Oyl from Popeye’s ship. She gets a few good licks in  which is delightful  and delivers ringside advice (“Give him the twister punch!”). But the victory belongs to the spinach-fortified Popeye. Clocking in at just over three minutes  “Jam Session” (1942) is badly scratched but is very much worth a watch and listen because it features Duke Ellington and his band — Ben Webster and Ray Nance are among its cool cats — playing “C Jam Blues.” The film set looks like an unused studio storage room  but the music is heavenly. The number ends  soon after Sonny Greer’s drum solo  with Ellington ambling over to join some female visitors. The film was produced as a Soundie  a musical movie that was shown jukebox-style in machines called Panorams  which were found in bars  nightclubs and the like. Patrons could summon up Ellington for a coin and start jitterbugging. Among the features on the registry playlist are a pair of shoestring classics from very different filmmakers. Written  directed and produced by Oscar Micheaux  “Within Our Gates” (1920) is a melodrama about black sovereignty and white racism that plays like a direct rebuke to D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation.” By turns touching and gravely disturbing  “Gates” is a passionate declaration of independence — political  cinematic  existential — from Micheaux  the first African-American filmmaker. Micheaux found his voice despite Hollywood and became a legend. The same holds true for Ida Lupino  whose taut  tense film noir “The Hitch-Hiker” (1953) is also available. Both movies are essential holdings in America’s greatest library.

They don’t seem too upset by the privacy., Supported by The zoo is closed  but essential staff still arrive to care for the roughly 6 000 animals. They don’t seem too upset by the privacy. By Julia Jacobs If a sea lion claps at the Bronx Zoo  and no one is around to hear it  does it make a sound? There is plenty of time to ponder koans these days at the animal park  where the coronavirus pandemic has left the sea lions  and the rest of its roughly 6 000 creatures  without an audience. In this busy season at the zoo  when people typically pack in — children atop their parents’ shoulders — to see the sea lions eat  there is no one standing at the pool railing. Or walking the pathways of Astor Court  with its Beaux-Arts buildings. Or sitting at the picnic tables. Or riding Wild Asia  the seasonal monorail that tours the habitats of red pandas  elephants and rhinos. Still  the life of the zoo goes on  as the sea lions perform their routines  no doubt encouraged by the fish they swallow in a single gulp. “The animals are blissfully unaware of what the rest of us have been going through ” said Jim Breheny  the director of the Bronx Zoo. “What I wouldn’t give for that innocence.” Unlike Broadway theaters or museums  zoos cannot go dark. Chinchillas need checkups. Penguin chicks might require help after they hatch. Captive tigers  alligators and grizzly bears probably shouldn’t be left to their own devices. “The animals that we care for rely on us for everything ” said Mr. Breheny  whose first job at age 14 was staffing the zoo’s camel rides. So since it closed to the public on March 16  the Bronx Zoo has been tending to animals while keeping its human employees as socially distant as possible. Roughly 300 workers of its 700-plus staff were deemed “essential” to care for animals and maintain the zoo’s operations. They are split in half into two teams  which report on alternating weeks. A spokeswoman for District Council 37  a union that represents zoo employees  said there had been no reports of layoffs or furloughs. Workers who still report find themselves following the routines they always have: spreading hay out so the American bison can graze; offering fish to Magellanic penguins eagerly snapping their beaks; and releasing the lions to laze around on exhibit. Others  including maintenance workers  electricians and plumbers  keep the sprawling campus operating. Mr. Breheny said the zoo’s mission right now is to keep the animals on a consistent routine. But its emptiness has not gone unnoticed  he added  by some primates. Last month  he took a moment to stop at one of the viewing spots for the baboon reserve  a two-acre space amid the 265-acre zoo designed to simulate the Ethiopian highlands. He said a group of geladas  monkeys with a crown of coffee-colored hair and upper lips that often flip up  moved toward him. He was likely the first human observer they had seen in a while  and they stared curiously at him through the glass. “They seemed to not understand why people aren’t here right now ” he said. The goats and alpacas in the children’s seasonal zoo are particularly accustomed to interacting with visitors  said Patrick Thomas  the zoo’s associate director  in an email. Now the only people those animals see are employees. “I don’t think our animals’ behavior has changed all that much ” he said  “but I do think that they’re aware that things are not the same.” The Central Park Zoo  Queens Zoo  Prospect Park Zoo and New York Aquarium are also shut indefinitely. The Wildlife Conservation Society  which runs these institutions  paired its Instagram announcement with the image of a somber sea lion who appeared to be frowning under its whiskers. While shuttered  the Bronx Zoo has lent itself to assisting health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic. In its deserted parking lots are white tents set up to test employees of the nearby Montefiore Medical Center for Covid-19 and 250 ambulances sent from around the country to help in New York City  the epicenter of America’s coronavirus crisis. For veteran staffers  the eerie quiet that now pervades the park is reminiscent of the vacant feeling after the Sept. 11 attacks  when it also shut down temporarily. Other zoos across the country  which are generally closed  can find parallels in the aftermath of natural disasters  like the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. For many zoos  revenue has flatlined  and there are concerns about their survival  said Dan Ashe  the president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Layoffs in the thousands are being announced. Zoos and aquariums hope to qualify for emergency loans from the Small Business Administration that were a part of the federal government’s $2 trillion stimulus package. “At a time when they have no revenue coming in the gate  they have to operate the facility at 100 percent ” Mr. Ashe said. Another concern for zoos  which have had to grapple with growing criticism of keeping animals in captivity  is the connection between wild animals and the novel coronavirus  which experts say likely originated in bats. According to a fact sheet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent to scientists who study zoonotic diseases  the agency has not received reports of wildlife or other animals becoming sick with Covid-19 in the United States  and there is no reason to think animals might be a source of infection here. Because humans and primates share genetic material and can potentially pass diseases between them  some zoos across the country had taken precautions before they closed  canceling behind-the-scenes tours where humans might be closer than usual to the animals  Mr. Ashe said. Even in the best of times  zookeepers in the Bronx have maintained a strict protocol of wearing masks and face shields around primates. The Bronx Zoo  which has long emphasized its ties to wildlife conservation  sees another purpose for itself during the pandemic: It is lobbying for a worldwide ban of the commercial trade of wildlife intended for human consumption. The Wildlife Conservation Society says the practice puts humans at risk of contracting diseases while trading live animals or eating fresh meat. According to a policy statement from the organization  such a ban would “significantly reduce the risk of a future zoonotic pandemic” and potentially prevent pandemics like Covid-19. Experts are investigating if the coronavirus passed from a bat to another animal that came into close contact with humans. On a lighter note  zoos and aquariums across the country have been trying to meet the demand of a housebound public enamored by animal videos. In Chicago  the Shedd Aquarium posted a series of viral videos showing their penguins wandering around the empty aquarium  coming face to face with beluga whales and colorful fish. In San Antonio  Texas  the city’s zoo has launched live streams of tree kangaroos lounging on tree branches and moon jellyfish floating in their fluorescent tanks. For its part  the Bronx Zoo has posted footage of a newly hatched blue penguin chick in the cupped hands of a zookeeper and a Malayan tiger splashing around in its watering hole. For now  trips to the zoo will have to remain virtual. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/arts/03virus-zoo4/merlin_171226743_25aa0c90-30ef-4d85-b23d-df4e66da3260-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

Try Reading ‘Hope and Help for Your Nerves’, Claire Weekes  a pioneer in treating anxiety  offered simple and soothing advice that has come to influence much of our approach to panic., Supported by Claire Weekes  a pioneer in treating anxiety  offered simple and soothing advice that has come to influence much of our approach to panic. By Hillary Kelly I felt the rumblings of a panic attack just now  while I was typing. It starts with a burning sensation in my temples. My chest tightens up a little  suddenly corseted  and my vision tunnels like one of those old Western photos in which everyone is grim-faced. That is merely the prequel. When the actual attack hits  it feels like the moment someone jumps out and scares you in a haunted house  except it lasts for 10  20  30 minutes at a time — words flying through my head unattached to any meaning  limbs tingling as if blood supply has slowed to a drip. Worst of all  my breath drops out like I’ve suddenly leapt to a great altitude  and a little voice pipes up telling me that this is it  my brain is about to tip into insanity  forever unable to return to normal. Right now  as coughs around the world are observed with quiet uncertainty (Cold or Covid-19? Flu or the first signs of worse?)  panic attacks are menaces in their own right  leaving sufferers to wonder how  exactly  their unreliable physiology is failing them. My first panic attacks happened at 21  after I had smoked some formidable weed. But it was later that they came on me in unrelenting waves  after I resigned from an imploding magazine in 2014 (while on my honeymoon in the Namibian desert  no less) and then found myself idle at home  stuck inside long empty days  lonely for the colleagues with whom I’d spent years establishing my bona fides as a book critic. These attacks reduced me to an inert little mouse  so fearful that I once slathered my legs in layer after layer of alcohol after dipping my toes into a creek — what if  my mind asked in an undying chant  that water is home to a flesh-eating bacteria? Now  tucked away in our house for all but the essential trips outside  days are starting to take on the same tenor. Five years ago  at my therapist’s urging  I kept track of every panic attack that washed over me: my record for a single day was 132. Soon I was diagnosed with agoraphobia and panic disorder  which is essentially a preoccupation with recurring panic attacks. An uptick in my SSRIs was the first wave of combat infantry  backed up by close work with the therapist. But it was a grey  mass-market paperback called “Hope and Help for Your Nerves ” with a front-cover blurb from Ann Landers  that became my talisman. Yes  I know what you’re thinking: A book critic shouldn’t fall for that. Face. Accept. Float. Let time pass. That’s the recipe that Dr. Claire Weekes  the Australian clinician and relatively underrecognized pioneer of modern anxiety treatment  established in a series of books (including “Hope and Help for Your Nerves ” her first) published from 1962 to 1989  the year before she died. This advice  when you encounter it in the midst of a cycle of breath-shortening attacks  may sound cruel. First  Weekes says  you must decide to truly experience the panic  to let it burst out into your fingers  your gut  your skull. Then  sink into it like a warm pool. Finally  rather than mentally kicking your legs to keep your nose out of the water  flip onto your back. “Stop holding tensely onto yourself ” she writes  “trying to control your fear  trying ‘to do something about it’ while subjecting yourself to constant self-analysis.” Just float through it  observing that it’s happening and recognizing that it will end. Weekes promises that “every unwelcome sensation can be banished  and you can regain peace of mind and body.” That’s a guarantee that  even in our cure-all-saturated world (Sex dust for orgasms! Crystals for … everything!)  is hard to square. But her advice  hard-earned through her own lifelong anxiety  which would wake her out of sleep to torment her  is so simple that “Hope and Help” essentially turns into a soothing repetition of two points. First  that what we’re mostly afraid of is fear. And second  that “by your own anxiety you are producing the very feelings you dislike so much.” Page after page offers the reassuring reminder that you can best fight your panic by refusing to fight the panic. And in short: It works. Weekes’s tactics have trickled out in drabs to influence much of cognitive behavioral therapy’s approach to panic. She was no lightweight — first an evolutionary biologist  then a general practitioner and made a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1973. Psychiatrists poo-pooed her theories in her day — her biographer Judith Hoare writes that as the guest speaker at a prominent psychotherapy conference in 1977  fellow doctors belittled her lack of formal training and “looked at their watches and talked among themselves” — but her work was propelled by word of mouth (“Hope and Help” had sold more than 400 000 copies by 1978)  and a cultish devotion to her simple and direct advice means that today the book is prized by the readers  including me  whom it has guided out of emotional suffocation. A scroll through its Amazon reviews turns up one gushing convert after another. The language of self-help  especially of the mental health variety  often emphasizes resilience and grit  like we’re mixed martial artists who ought to stand firm after every wallop. (“Badass Ways to End Anxiety & Stop Panic Attacks! ” exclamation point included  is one of the sponsored books Amazon shows above Weekes’s books.) But “Hope and Help for Your Nerves ” which walks us through every possible physical symptom of panic — from “giddinesss” to “sore scalp” — sounds practically Victorian to our modern ears  in both its lingo and its prescription. Weekes refers to panic as “nervous illness ” and illustrates it with images like the shaking hands of a vicar’s wife as she struggles with “cups of tea rattling in their saucers.” Perhaps it was that strange step back in time that turned me into a Claire Weekes acolyte — I could imagine her walking in to soothe the “hysterical” captive of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s feminist classic “The Yellow Wallpaper” and pull her back out of the walls. I started recommending the book to friends who admitted to their own secret panic. I kept it at hand for hourly reminders that I needn’t activate some dormant intrepid fighter inside me who could claw my brain back to stability like a member of Roald Amundsen’s Antarctic crew. Stuck inside again these days  I’ve been paging through “Hope and Help ” rereading the portions I underlined five years ago  when my fingers dulled the ink’s crispness with their fervor. If this book is my amulet  it isn’t the only one — for one angsty year  I carried Fernando Pessoa everywhere; and though I’m an atheist  I travel with my grandmother’s novena book as if its pages could flap hard enough to keep a plane aloft. But Weekes’s work has the particular effect of pushing me to see that something lies beyond the moments of slip-sliding terror I find myself in every few hours  or minutes. This isn’t how book critics behave  or so I’ve been led to believe. Books are supposed to meet higher standards than just the emotional release they incite. Which is true. But they can also be ballast  and in a time like this I refuse to cede an essential value of books just to maintain some irrelevant dedication to an intellectual credo. Especially since this one has potent advice for the present moment  when many of us feel we must push back our disquiet more tenaciously than ever. If you’re afraid  then be afraid. You might float through to the other side.

03/04/2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/technology/virus-tech-lobbyists-gains.html, technology, How Tech’s Lobbyists Are Using the Pandemic to Make Gains, Silicon Valley hasn’t suffered from the same financial devastation as other industries. Tech companies still have an agenda to push., Supported by Silicon Valley hasn’t suffered from the same financial devastation as other industries. Tech companies still have an agenda to push. By David McCabe WASHINGTON — Last month  lobbying groups representing advertising giants like Google and Facebook asked California’s attorney general to wait to enforce the state’s new online privacy rules given the coronavirus ripping around the world. In Washington  lobbyists representing cloud computing giants like Amazon pushed for more money to help federal employees work remotely. And Uber began reframing a longtime campaign to avoid classifying its drivers as full-time employees through the urgency of a mounting public health crisis. The coronavirus has created an opportunity for tech companies and their lobbying operations to quietly push for long-held goals in the frantic political and economic environment created by the outbreak. In some cases  groups or lobbyists representing companies like Google and Facebook have pursued changes  like the delay in California’s privacy law enforcement  that they were already hoping for before the pandemic. Others representing companies such as Amazon have asked for regulatory changes to benefit their businesses where demand is now soaring because of the outbreak. “It’s certainly opportunistic ” said Daniel Auble  the senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics  a research organization that tracks money in politics. “Everybody’s searching for every way that they can get some kind of assistance  whether it’s cash or delaying a regulation that will cost them money to implement  and may or may not have an effect on their performance during the crisis in essential ways.” While many industries rocked by the virus have recently asked Congress for direct financial assistance  tech companies’ requests are striking because Silicon Valley has not suffered from the same devastation as businesses in areas like travel or retailing. Instead  tech services are increasingly in demand as millions of people work and socialize from home to avoid being infected by the coronavirus. Amazon orders have soared so much that the company has put a priority on shipping essential items like soap  food and toilet paper. Google has provided temporary free access to some of its remote work tools. And Facebook’s traffic has surged. “Amazon  Google and Facebook are very well positioned ” said John Blackledge  a tech analyst at Cowen  adding that the companies have substantial cash reserves to weather an economic downturn. Tech lobbyists have nonetheless seized the moment. In the weeks before the virus swept the United States  groups representing Google  Facebook and Twitter already wanted the California attorney general  Xavier Becerra  to wait to enforce the state’s new privacy rules until 2021. The law  known as the California Consumer Privacy Act  requires businesses to give people a copy of the data that has been collected about them  as well as the ability to delete it. Companies have complained that the rules would place too many obligations on businesses. The law went into effect this year  but California will not start enforcing it until July. “We thought even before this that there should be a delay ” said Dan Jaffe  the group executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers  because of the slow speed with which the rules were being enacted. Now the pandemic has added urgency to the groups’ request  he said. In a letter on March 17 addressed to Mr. Becerra  more than 30 groups  including lobbying blocs for non-internet businesses  said many “companies have instituted mandatory work-from-home measures to limit community spread of the virus  meaning that the individuals who are responsible for creating processes to comply” with the law weren’t in the office to work on the issue. They asked him to wait to enforce the rules until 2021. “If you’re on a ventilator  you’re not going to be doing a lot to be responding to a regulatory demand ” Mr. Jaffe said. “I’m not trying to pretend that that’s yet the situation  but those are real-world things that could happen.” An adviser to Mr. Becerra  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said his office was still committed to enforcing the rules starting this summer. (This week  Gavin Newsom  the governor of California  delayed some regulatory processes in light of the virus.) Facebook  Google and Twitter  which are represented by some of the groups that signed the letter  declined to comment. Other companies with growing demand for their products have pushed for deregulation or other government action that would benefit them  arguing it would improve the response to the virus crisis. Trade associations representing drone makers like Amazon and the Alphabet subsidiary Wing have tried to expedite approval for airborne deliveries — or waive approvals altogether — and eliminate prohibitions on the circumstances under which the devices can be operated. Amazon and Wing declined to comment. Instacart  the delivery start-up that recently announced it would hire 300 000 more grocery delivery contractors to meet new demand  said it had told policymakers that one of its priorities was expanding a pilot program where customers can use federal food services  like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  to buy goods online. Several lobbying groups representing the cloud computing industry  including Amazon and Google  have also encouraged federal officials to grant faster approvals for the services to be adopted in light of the virus or to provide more funding for federal employees to work from home. Matthew Cornelius  a former federal official who leads the Alliance for Digital Innovation  which represents Amazon and Salesforce  said rapid spread of telework in the federal government validated the industry’s argument that agencies should be able to more quickly use their products. He hopes that after the immediate shock of the virus passes  he said  the government and industry will look at lessons in how the government can increasingly do work in the cloud. “I think this is a tremendous opportunity ” he said. Uber  too  has cast a long-waged policy fight as newly urgent in light of the coronavirus. For years  the ride-hailing company  whose drivers are contractors  has resisted calls to make them full-time employees. Federal law does not require companies to give contractors certain benefits and protections  like health insurance  which can be expensive for companies to provide. Last year  California lawmakers approved a measure meant to provide employment protections to contractors  over the continued objections of Uber  Lyft and others. In recent days  Dara Khosrowshahi  Uber’s chief executive  has said the virus crisis shows the importance of creating a new classification for workers who are neither employees nor contractors  something the company pushed for before the pandemic took shape. Last week  Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote a letter to President Trump  calling for the so-called third way approach. He has also spoken to lawmakers on Capitol Hill  including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  since the outbreak began. Privately  Uber has gone further. The company has asked lawmakers to shield it from lawsuits over how its drivers are classified if it provides the drivers with medical supplies or compensation during the pandemic  according to a mid-March email obtained by The New York Times. A labor lawyer recently asked courts in California and Massachusetts to reclassify Uber and Lyft drivers as employees in light of the crisis. An Uber spokeswoman  Susan Hendrick  said in an email that a so-called safe harbor provision to shield the company from lawsuits would let it provide benefits to drivers until the law was permanently changed. Lyft said in a statement that it was not proactively seeking such a safe harbor from lawsuits but that it would back one. The idea pushed by Uber has gained traction in Congress. Last week  a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent congressional leaders a letter asking for the legal shield that the ride-hailing companies support. Some in the tech industry are sensitive to any appearance they are seizing on a crisis for their own gain. Aaron Cooper  vice president for global policy at BSA  an enterprise software trade group  said it believed that increased sharing of private and public data could help improve the response to the virus. But he bristled when asked if BSA was lobbying to trim regulations that might hold that kind of sharing back. “It’s not the right time to be trying to push the government to change rules ” he said. Kate Conger contributed reporting from San Francisco. Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report  Scott Gottlieb  Caitlin Rivers  Mark B. McClellan  Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization  without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days. Charity Navigator  which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system  has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross  and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30 000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal  though.) If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have  and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing  call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested  how to get tested  and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now  the C.D.C.  like the W.H.O.  has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic  for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. It seems to spread very easily from person to person  especially in homes  hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face. No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States  China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away. Unlike the flu  there is no known treatment or vaccine  and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu  but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home  you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms  while also keeping as much distance as possible  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space  the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available  both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters  doorknobs  toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. Yes  but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park  rather than go for a jog or a walk  getting some fresh air  and hopefully sunshine  is a good idea. That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired  having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation  or even grows  makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years. Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions  make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.” Advertisement , https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/04/business/00JPvirus-techlobby2-print/merlin_165484125_6784bf02-0544-4ae3-9614-0cb6c3017c5c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale

By Tiffany Hsu The billboard was blank. In all the times Takeshi Sato had walked through Shibuya Crossing  Tokyo’s answer to Times Square  he had been more or less surrounded by ads. But on March 23  he noticed something strange looming over the pedestrians: an empty sign. “I thought  ‘Oh  this is not normal ’ and I remember feeling depressed ” Mr. Sato said. “But it’s understandable that advertisers want to stop running ads on billboards  because fewer people are going out.” Even in 2011  after a devastating earthquake and tsunami  the billboards in that part of town were full  he said. The blank spot in Shibuya  facing one of the world’s busiest intersections  suggested the far-reaching effects of the coronavirus. ???????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/LM4xdD7ljE Companies that spent big to get the word out about their products before the pandemic have hit the brakes. Facebook has described its advertising business as “weakening.” Amazon has reduced its Google Shopping ads. Coca-Cola  Kohl’s and Zillow Group have stopped or limited their marketing. Marriott’s advertising  in the words of the company’s chief executive  has “gone dark.” “A lot of advertisers are just pulling back — the tide’s going out ” said Garrett Johnson  an assistant marketing professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business. “If the economy is not doing well  if firms are bleeding cash as a result of Covid  we’re not going to be seeing too much advertising.” Ads became an unavoidable part of modern life for a simple reason: They work. Each dollar that companies spent on advertising in the United States last year led to $9 in sales  the research firm IHS Markit estimated. And while the barrage of marketing messages can seem like background noise  their absence would be conspicuous. The ad industry employs about 500 000 people in the United States. Their work blankets movie screens  smartphones  buildings  stadiums and inbox-clogging promotional emails. Companies that regularly buy ads are the lifeblood of TV networks  podcast companies  news outlets  lifestyle publications and pretty much all of the internet — and when they spend less on marketing  there is a ripple effect. During the Great Recession  more than $60.5 billion in global ad spending evaporated  according to the WARC research group. It took eight years for the industry to fully recover. Close observers of how the advertising business has fared in recent weeks say the new crisis may be worse. “It was a seismic shock  possibly the biggest we have faced  ever ” said Harris Diamond  the chief executive of the advertising company McCann Worldgroup. “It all took place in a very short period of time  and is having an impact everywhere we communicate.” Overall spending on digital ads for March and April is down 38 percent from what companies had expected to lay out  and ad spending has fallen 41 percent on TV  45 percent on radio  43 percent in print publications  and 51 percent on billboards and other outdoor platforms  according to the trade group IAB. Advertising giants like Interpublic Group and Publicis have suspended their financial forecasts  saying they were uncertain about the future. The Cannes Lions conference  one of the biggest events on the ad-industry calendar  was postponed last month  then canceled early on Friday. The major TV networks will not be hosting their annual New York gathering  known as the upfronts  to hype their fall shows before an audience of corporate sponsors and ad executives. Similar events for digital platforms like YouTube and Hulu were also postponed. “We’re working through this as it’s unfolding  just like everyone else ” said Patty Morris  an assistant vice president of marketing for the insurance company State Farm. “There are things happening that we’ve never seen before.” State Farm had planned to advertise during National Basketball Association games and the N.C.A.A.’s annual men’s basketball tournament. It had also expected to run ads during coverage of the Summer Olympics on Peacock  the streaming service that NBCUniversal is scheduled to start nationwide on July 15. And now? “We’re trying to deal with all of the cancellations  trying to understand what’s happening here ” Ms. Morris said. With production studios shut down  and filming of commercials at a standstill  a bare-bones style of advertising has emerged. On a recent night  the NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon read out a State Farm ad in the manner of a podcaster at the start of his shot-from-home episode of “The Tonight Show.” After plugging the insurance giant  Mr. Fallon held up a scrap of paper on which one of his daughters had scrawled the company’s website address. On YouTube  the “Tonight Show” episode was preceded in some cases by a State Farm commercial called “New Normal ” a mash-up of old footage and videos made by nonprofessionals. Many companies are trying to protect their brand names by keeping their ads away from media reports about overrun hospitals  joblessness and death. As news organizations ramp up their coronavirus coverage  they are losing out on the revenue that would have come their way in more pleasant times  because many companies have stipulated that their ads must not appear near articles that include outbreak-related keywords. British news organizations  including The Guardian and Daily Mail  wrote in an open letter this week that so-called blacklisting will cost news outlets more than $60 million if the pandemic lasts another three months. “Readers are relying on us right now  and we are relying on advertising ” the publishers noted. The companies that have continued to advertise are treading lightly as they try to find a way to keep customers aware of their products while acknowledging the pandemic. Kentucky Fried Chicken reacted to the changed atmosphere last month by canceling a British commercial  set to a Chopin nocturne  that showed dozens of people eating chicken and licking their fingers. In online ads  Audi and Volkswagen have spread out the letters and symbols in their logos to encourage social distancing. A Times Square billboard made for Coca-Cola by a McCann agency also presented the company logo with the letters spaced apart. A recent commercial from Lincoln  part of Ford Motor  underscored the theme of isolation. Created by the Hudson Rouge agency  the ad repurposed footage of a woman and a child in a sparsely decorated house in the middle of nowhere. A voice-over seems to address life during quarantine: “More than ever  your home is your sanctuary.” The commercial then shows Lincoln picking up a car that needs servicing and leaving a loaner vehicle in its place. “A lot of clients are shifting their messaging to what they think is going to be most useful to customers  to how they can help ” said Michael Epstein  a media-planning executive at the marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network. Many ads now feel like public service announcements. The flu medicine company Mucinex introduced an educational campaign called “Spread Facts  Not Fear.” Images related to washing increased 600 percent in ads on social media last month  according to an analysis by the Pattern89 artificial intelligence platform  and depictions of crowds fell 54 percent. “Today  if you get the tone wrong  it’s an unforgivable sin ” said Mr. Diamond of McCann. “The ability to reach audiences is unparalleled right now  but their willingness to accept marketing messages is limited to the right messages.” Updated April 11  2020 This is a difficult question  because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained.

It will still hold a “virtual” draft later this month., Supported by The league had been set to begin play on May 15. It will still hold a “virtual” draft later this month. By The Associated Press The W.N.B.A. has postponed the start of its season because of the coronavirus pandemic  with no indication when play would begin. The league was scheduled to open training camps on April 26 and the regular season was set to begin on May 15. The W.N.B.A. will still hold a “virtual” draft on April 17. W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a statement on Friday that the league will “use this time to conduct scenario-planning regarding new start dates and innovative formats.” “Our guiding principle will continue to be the health and safety of the players  fans and employees ” Engelbert said. The W.N.B.A.  which was set to begin its 24th season  is the longest running professional women’s sports league. With the Summer Olympics also postponed  the W.N.B.A. will have additional flexibility with its schedule. The league was set to go on a monthlong break starting July 10 to allow players to participate in the Tokyo Games. The U.S. women’s basketball team has won six consecutive gold medals. Every other major sports league has been put on hold because of the virus. The N.B.A. suspended its season on March 11 after one of its players tested positive for the virus. In an interview with The New York Times last month  Engelbert said that the morning after the N.B.A. suspended its season she contacted Terri Jackson  the head of the W.N.B.A.’s players’ union  to discuss plans for delaying their season for up to 90 days. The delay could position the seasons of the W.N.B.A. and N.B.A. to overlap much more than usual; the N.B.A. typically has just a month of playoff games remaining when the W.N.B.A.’s season begins. Engelbert told The Times that additional overlap this year could give her league a chance to expose itself to new audiences  such as by playing home games in different venues or by having doubleheaders with N.B.A. games. “One of our transformational goals is to expand the fandom  expand the reach of the W.N.B.A. beyond our 12 cities to get more exposure to our players in our potential fan population ” Engelbert told The Times. “So we could actually be creative here and think about other cities.” Two W.N.B.A. cities are major hot spots for the virus: New York and Seattle. One of the Storm’s homes for the season  the Angel of the Winds Arena  is being used as a coronavirus isolation site. The Las Vegas casino where the Aces play is shut  as is the Connecticut Sun’s home arena. “We continue to send our thoughts and prayers to our players  fans  and all of those in the community impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and are grateful to those selfless health care workers and first responders who work tirelessly on the front lines ” Engelbert said in the statement on Friday.
