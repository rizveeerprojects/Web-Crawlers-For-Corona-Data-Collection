He decided to write a book on Delhi’s fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic.,Dr Maheshwar Prasad Chaurasia always wanted to write a novel. In May  he attended a webinar on how to write and publish a book. At the workshop  his writing instructor suggested that he start his journey as an author with a non-fictional work. He decided to write a book on Delhi’s fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic.  Dr Chaurasia was qualified to do so —as additional superintendent at Delhi’s government’s Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital  he was part of the core team that set up the city’s first quarantine centres  isolation wards and testing facilities in the initial months of the pandemic.  “Those were the early days of the pandemic and we did not know much about the virus. Doctors and officials went sleepless for days as they fought the pandemic. People were in a panic and were asking so many questions. My book is about how the doctors and the administration fought the pandemic in its initial months ” says Chaurasia   whose book -- Just Switch Off Corona -- was released last month.  Chaurasia is not the only writer to have been inspired by the pandemic. Hundreds of books with titles such as Corona: A Checkmate; Murder in the Time of Corona; The Corona Wars; Corona Kiss; The Pandemic Plot; My Pandemic Experience  have been published in the past couple of months. Interestingly  a majority of these books -- poetry  fiction  non-fiction in English  Hindi  Tamil and many other Indian languages -- are by first- time writers and have been brought out by self- publishing companies.  The writers of these books include doctors  information technology (IT) professionals  teachers  most of whom seem to have drawn from their own experiences and understanding of the pandemic.  Dr Kumar Shyam  who lives in Hapur  a town in the National Capital Region  about 70 km from Delhi  last month published The Pandemic Plot  a novel that he says draws from the conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and nature of the coronavirus. The book that moves from Wuhan in China to Italy is the story of an international medical team comprising scientists from many countries  including India  who go on a mission to find the answers to some of the trickiest questions about the origin and spread of the virus.  His slim page-turner about this global quest ends with the conclusion that researchers at a Wuhan lab get infected and die and the virus spreads into the rest of the world.  “The governments and health systems around the world did not know what had hit them and there are so many conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and spread of the virus. l thought all of this made for a novel. I used many real incidents to connect the dots  ” says Dr Shyam  a general surgeon  who owns a 100-bed hospital in Hapur.“Being a doctor helped me write about virology with authenticity ” says the doctor  who wrote the book every night in his personal library that boasts 3 000 books.  Rahul Bhardwaj  managing director at Yash Publications  which published The Pandemic Plot  says the book is a hit  having sold over 3 000 copies in hardback and paperback since its release last month.  “We have got 30 proposals for books on Corona and have already published three. Four more will be published next month ” Bhardwaj adds.  Notion Press  one of the country’s biggest self- publishing companies has brought out as many as 40 titles on the coronavirus  both fiction and non-fiction in English  Hindi and Tamil. Some of the titles published by it include Born in Lockdown  Pandemic Spell  Murder in the Time of Corona  Why and How China developed the Coronavirus.  Interestingly  Naveen Valsakumar  co-founder and CEO of Notion Press  says that one of the reasons why there are so many coronavirus-related books on his company’s platform is that a lot of the writers are young and tech-savvy  who studied Google Trends and realised that there was a lot of curiosity about the pandemic.  “So  they decided to write books based on those trending searches. We made it clear to all writers that we will not publish any book offering unvalidated medical advice on Corona. For many people  writing about the pandemic has been a cathartic experience ” says Valsakumar.  Love and romance are among the most popular genres among those writing on the coronavirus. Sample some of the titles in the category: Corona Kiss  Cupid Covid; Love in the Time of Corona Virus  A Second Chance with Love in Corona. In fact  there are dozens of books titled Love in the Time of Corona. A lot of these stories involve young doctors whose lives are torn apart as they fight the virus.  “Lockdown had a deep impact on relationships and that is the subject of my two Corona books” says Kawalpreet Kaur  a 26-year-old teacher. Her first book  Love in the Time of Corona Virus  and its sequel  The Dark 21 Days  feature the stories of two youngsters who battle not just caste  and but also Covid-19 in a hospital in Italy.  Sayed Arshad  founder of Blue Rose Publishers says the reason why most books have been published by self- publishing companies is their ability to bring out a book fast  something many of the writers want. “Normally it takes about seven months to bring out a book  most self- publishing companies take three weeks flat ” he said.  After English  the maximum number of books on the coronavirus are in Hindi  and with some curious tiles: Namaste Corona ; Corona se Atmagyan ( Enlightenment through Corona) ; Akash Me Corona Ghana Hai ( The Sky is eclipsed by dense Corona) ; Corona Ek Safar ( Corona  a journey) . Rounak Rai  an art teacher and author of Corona se Atmagyan  a collection of 33 poems accompanied by his drawings  says he wrote the book during the lockdown.  “Corona brought out the best and the worst in human beings. My book captures the pain  the suffering and what this pandemic taught us about ourselves and about others ” said Rai. “ But one of the unintended benefits of the pandemic is the fact that it encouraged people to look within and become writers.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-warriors-survivors-wield-pen-as-pandemic-inspires-fiction/story-Ry8ArMSlW0Eypv6FJMhEkP.html

30/10/2020,government;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;iraq,Review: The Ultimate Goal by Vikram Sood,Former R&AW chief Vikram Sood outlines how narratives are crucial to any country’s goal of avoiding being dominated by another,“The battle of narratives has never been so grim as it is today  because real power comes not from the barrel of a gun but from those who control the narrative ” asserts former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Vikram Sood. With these words he delves deep into outlining how narratives are crucial to any country’s “ultimate goal” of not just domination but equally of not being dominated by another nation.  In his book  The Ultimate Goal  Sood shows how nations construct narratives. In a fascinating and comprehensive analysis of how countries enhance their strength and position  the author candidly admits that narratives are not always based on truth but explains why they need to at least be plausible for them to create the desired perception.  Sood headed India’s external intelligence agency and knows how agencies like America’s CIA and the Russian KGB contributed to controlling narratives.  The book  in fact  starts with an interesting case study of the assassination of American President John F Kennedy in 1963 and touches on how the powerful connived to build a narrative that JFK had been shot from behind by a lone assassin while there was evidence  including from a bystander  that the former President had  in fact  taken bullets from the front and from three directions.  Five years later  JFK’s brother  Robert was killed. “Like his brother  Robert too favoured peace in Vietnam. Someone had written and executed a different narrative for the brothers. It was clear that there were powerful interests in the country who did not want John F Kennedy to continue as president and did not want Robert Kennedy to be president either ” writes Sood. “Narratives are not the truth; rather  they nudge you to understand the truth in a particular way. They are never neutral or innocent; they are always strategic…It is much like advertising – create a brand  a dream and a need for the product. That is the ultimate goal of any power-seeking global dominance ” he adds.  A timely book neatly divided into chapters that effortlessly tell the stories of America  Russia and China  it also takes into account how China is dealing with criticism over how the deadly Corona virus – now ravaging the world – emanated from its soil. The former spymaster explains how it is trying to damage control a narrative that interferes with its geopolitical and economic goals and points out that the Corona crisis has deepened the fault lines between China and the US under Donald Trump; especially now that the US is in the midst of an election.  The book will interest intelligence agencies worldwide but is sure to have a bigger reading audience too as the narrative-building factory has a wide array of players that includes the military  the media  the film industry  the Church and the powerful corporate world that is closely linked to governments in all countries.  Read it to learn how a narrative can become truth through persuasion “somewhat like a Coca-Cola advertisement  or through manipulation of the mind  as was done by the US administration in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003.” Sood writes  “Narratives are for self-justification; they are designed by the narrator not only to tell his version his way but also to tell your version his way.” He should know. He’s been in the business of spy craft for decades and is now part of the Observer Research Foundation  a public policy think tank.  Where the book disappoints and leaves you yearning for more is when it finally gets to the India chapter. In the introduction  Sood teases the reader about how India’s narrative was created by the West  from the time it ruled the world. He also says  the chapter “deals with how India now tries to answer the question: who are we  and what is an India for all  without favours?”  The answers  however  are not detailed through a case study of how any contemporary Indian government has sought to build a “narrative” with the help of the media – print television or internet  its intelligence agencies or its tech and corporate worlds.  According to the author  “A premeditated dislike for India’s governing BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has added to a global narrative encouraged by negative perceptions that appear in the Indian press. The term ‘fascist’ is bandied about  yet no critic of the government  however virulent  has been stifled.”  Many would find this contentious and point to recent events including the Bhima Koregaon investigation  the Delhi riots charge sheet  and the stifling of voices against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act.  This is an engaging book that shows the reader how governments  the world over  and their intelligence agencies nudge narratives in their attempt to achieve the “ultimate goal” of domination.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/review-the-ultimate-goal-by-vikram-sood/story-hjdxXLqc0ZNDfD7yBmkkmM.html

24/10/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,10 ways to ensure safe and hygienic indoors for your family,As India faces Unlock 5.0  the concept of hygiene has changed. Here are some suggestions to keep you and your loved one’s safe.,As the country eases the lockdown restrictions and we get into “unlock” mode; stepping out of our isolated bubbles and securing our home against infections has become critical.  Regardless of how much you plan to step out now that restaurants and malls are operational  it is important that you practise social distancing  wear a mask when you are outside home and maintain good hygiene habits.  The virus continues to play havoc in most parts of the country. People are doing everything they can to keep themselves safe but what about your dream abode? It is time to pay proper attention to it! We look at 10 quick and easy suggestions to protect you and your family! 1.Keep your living spaces well ventilated: Open the doors and windows every day to allow fresh air to circulate around the house. Air conditioning can reduce the risk of transmission of the virus through air by reducing its airborne concentration. But this is effective only when a ceiling fan is switched on.  2.Add new colours to your walls with protection: The hygiene of our home is of utmost importance today. Thus  protecting the surfaces in our home and keeping them safe  is the need of the hour. Paint your house with Asian Paints Royale Health Shield range of products – The Anti-Bacterial Multi Surface Paint. It has two sets of products in it - Royale Health Shield and Royale Health Shield Clear. Royale Health Shield can be applied on your walls to give a new look with a colour of your choice and also gives Anti-Bacterial protection to your walls. Royale Health Shield Clear is a protective clear coat that can be applied on your pre-painted interior surfaces to give Anti-Bacterial protection. Royale Health Shield range of products can kill 99%# bacteria on painted surfaces within 2 hours of exposure.The Silver Ion Technology in the paint is recommended* by the Indian Medical Association. Royale Health Shield range of products is a revolutionary solution that combines hygiene and aesthetics to ensure safe & beautiful surfaces in your home. 3.Clean your hands often: While it is recommended to wash your hands for 20 seconds each time you come into contact with any object that could have a risk of contamination  you can use a sanitizer with over 60 per cent alcohol in case soap and water is unavailable as well. Disinfect all frequently used surfaces around the home using disinfectants and sanitizers. 4.Use vegetable and fruit disinfectants that kill bacteria  viruses  fungi and other pathogens that are present on the surface of food items and stay safe from food-borne diseases. When ordering a takeaway  dispose off the container right at the doorstep and heat the food well before eating. All outside packaging must be discarded immediately in a closed bin as soon as you can. 5.Indulge in an Anti-Viral Mattress Protector that focuses on providing a fresh  safe and hygienic sleep environment by neutralising enveloped viruses and bacteria and also keeps dust particles at bay. Wash all bedding  linen and sheets frequently using a good-quality laundry detergent.  6.Use a good water purifier: In these troubled times  its best to limit your visits to the hospital for absolutely unavoidable circumstances. One of the most important steps towards this is ensuring a steady supply of clean drinking water  which only a good water purifier can provide. Pick one that filters the impurities even as it retains the goodness of alkaline minerals. 7.Clean carpets and rugs regularly: Carpets and rugs can contain a range of synthetic chemicals that can pollute your home. They also have potential to trap dust  bacteria and viruses. Use a good home cleaning system that can drive away all the germs off the carpets and leave them dust-free.  8.Leave your shoes outside the home: The easiest way to keep the germs out of your home is by leaving your footwear outside. Place a trendy shoe rack right at the main door and use this to store the shoes you regularly wear outside as they may contain viruses and bacteria. 9.Using hand-held products like UV lights as disinfectants is also a good idea. Commonly available boxed sterilizers using UV lights can be used to disinfect household products. But direct exposure to the human skin can be a health hazard  so be sure to handle the apparatus with care.  10.Avoid going to social gatherings or throwing dinner parties at home for some time in order to minimize the chances of being in company of many people in a closed environment. Limit your exposures and if you feel at risk  wear a mask  even if you are indoors. Social distancing is the new normal and ensure that you follow it to the tee at your home. So stay home as much as you can  clean and disinfect properly  and stay safe!

23/10/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;united states,Review: The Phoenix Rises: Lockdown Chronicles edited by Amit Dasgupta,An anthology that approaches the lockdown and the pandemic from different angles,A lot has changed too fast. Lockdowns implemented in varying degrees across the world have transformed how we deal with our lives. The experience has been unlike any other in recent memory  just like the Covid-19 pandemic itself. Someone had to think of a book that captures the experiences of people who have lived with the draconian lockdown in recent months. The Phoneix Rises: Lockdown Chronicles edited by Amit Dasgupta  an anthology in which writers from different walks of life have approached the theme from different angles  is that publication.  The slim volume of writings  many of them short  has several stories and ideas that are instantly relatable. There are exceptions too  such as veteran seaman Beetashok Chatterjee’s piece on seafarers who have been meeting the everyday challenges of their profession in a redefined new world.  The need of the hour is for nations to keep aside their differences and come together to combat the global medical emergency. In his piece  Jug Suraiya notes  “For the first time  humanity is facing a fight to the finish  which does not divide it into opposing factions but unifies it against a common foe.” We know who the foe is. What we do not know is how to stop it from infecting people  which can prove fatal.  Healthcare specialists in many countries are working overtime in research labs as the search for a reliable vaccine continues. Meanwhile  doctors and their support staff have emerged as the real heroes. In a heartfelt tribute to the profession  Nikita Bathla tells the reader  “We bid farewell and distance ourselves from our families  not wanting to expose our loved ones to our occupational hazards. We realise we are not prepared; we are reacting.”  Producing an anthology in which all the contributions are uniformly good is impossible. That is the problem here  too  since some pieces do not have much to say while the others state too much of the obvious. What makes it readable nonetheless is the presence of pieces marked by the imaginative presentation of thoughts. Antara Dev Sen takes off with a charming little story revolving around her daughter and proceeds to reflect on the pandemic. She makes a satirical reference to Ma Corona: “Anyway  I have to go. Time for my Corona puja. Women across Bihar  Bengal  Assam  Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are single-handedly warding off COVID-19 by their diligent worship of Ma Corona or Corona Mai. I need to do my share.” Humankind surrenders to God when everything else seems powerless.  Years from now  readers of history will reflect on the ongoing pandemic just as we do about the Spanish Flu today. Defining 2020 as a ‘decisive watershed in the human story ’ Anjum Katyal says the pandemic has been “a truly universal experience  affecting everyone... right from celebrities in their mansions to the homeless on the streets.” It is clear that each one of us must exercise caution if we wish to avoid infection. United States President Donald Trump who pretended to be ‘macho’ and indifferent tested positive like other ordinary mortals.  In an introspective essay  Jael Silliman reflects on her life in badly-affected New York and asks when India will relax its “draconian lockdown of 1.3 billion people.” Relaxation has already taken place  of course  although we are still waiting to see what happens after schools and cinema halls  where maintaining social distance is difficult if not impossible  start functioning normally.  Dilip Bobb  in his insightful piece  believes that “With billions around the world in some kind of lockdown  this is the largest psychological experiment ever undertaken.” Experts have been pointing out that the pandemic will have an impact on the mental health of patients and others too. Bobb believes that ‘a number may emerge stronger and more resilient’  a possibility that should please everybody. The Phoenix Rises is part of an emerging genre of writing that records the impact of the pandemic. Given the times  we can expect to read more such anthologies with new insights and personal narratives soon.  Biswadeep Ghosh is a journalist  author  and teacher.

22/10/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Reset  refresh  rejuvenate: How approaches to financial planning need to change post-pandemic,The economic fallout has caused a seismic shift in the attitude towards money. Job losses  salary cuts  and shutdown in businesses have upended lives for many.,For Maanvi Chhabra  a finance professional  the Corona virus disaster could not have come at a worse time. Having landed a cushy job at a top-tier technology organization early this year  she was confident that she could comfortably pay off her debts in the next two years without compromising on her other goals. Building an emergency fund for rainy days was not a priority; the handsome pay ensured thoughts of unforeseen situations did not cross her mind. But before she could start paying her EMIs  Chhabra’s employer was forced to shut shop owing to mounting losses due to the lockdown.  The Covid-19 pandemic brought the world economy to a grinding halt in the first half of this year. In the past few months  governments across the world have been compelled to seal borders  cease trade and manufacturing and confine citizens inside their homes to stop the death toll from surging. Although lockdown restrictions have been eased in most countries and economic activities are being resuscitated  it will be a while before the economy can be nursed back to health. In fact  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Chief Economist Gita Gopinath warned in September that a full recovery of the global economy remained unlikely until a vaccine was discovered.  The economic fallout has caused a seismic shift in the attitude towards money. Job losses  salary cuts  and shutdown in businesses have upended lives for many  the impacts of which have been devastating for those whose finances were already in fragile shape. Coupled with income uncertainties  the fear of contracting the infection and the thought of being burdened under a mountain of medical expenses has spurred people to re-evaluate their financial goals.  Realigning goals Talking about the impact of the pandemic on financial goals  Arjun Chhabra  a chartered accountant  says  “I don’t think my long-term goals will be impacted. The silver lining that has emerged in this crisis - there is more money in hand due to the fall in recreational expenses and I think it will be easy for me to meet my short-term goals. I have started focusing more on saving than investing because the markets are so volatile. New investments  especially high-risk ones remain out of the question. My priority in the short-term is to maintain liquidity by having enough savings.” Nitin Rao  the CEO of InCred Wealth asserts that the current tremors in the economy have necessitated a shift in the approach to maintaining financial well-being. He says  “The markets have never had to face an unforeseen event of this nature in the past. Earlier investment cycles were usually predictable (every 3 to 4 years) and aligned with economic activity but now what with jobs and earnings at risk  short-term goals and priorities have to be aligned with those risks. Government interventions through fiscal and monetary stimulus have also in turn changed the returns expectations for all. For instance  debt instruments that were giving ~7% earlier are now giving around 3%. Vikas Gupta  CEO at Omniscience Capital opined that the redrafting of goals primarily depends on the extent to which one’s income stream has been disrupted by the pandemic. He says  “Those whose income streams have not been disrupted  need not worry about changing their goals. Rather for them it is an opportunity because of the volatility in the stock markets and undervaluing of asset classes caused by the economic downturn. Those who have seen a significant drop in their earnings will first have to think of regenerating their income. Depending on whether they had a contingency fund or if they have had to tap into their existing investments to keep themselves afloat  they will have to re-evaluate their goals. The biggest takeaway for both these groups are that everyone should have a contingency fund that can help them pay for at least six months of basic living expenses.” Mapping strategies with the changing situation Given that the economy will take a while to regain its pre-pandemic health  the first step towards resetting your finances has to be maintaining a tight leash on your expenses. Gupta explains  “Irrespective of whether your income has remained unchanged  has been partially impacted or completely dwindled  you have to force yourself to go on a tight budget and keep expenses at minimum. That increases your search opportunity for new income streams for longer periods of time. If you need to tap into your investments  fixed income instruments are preferable as this minimizes the risk you would be exposed to should you play around with your equity investments.” According to Rao  the planning for the next one year will hinge on liquidity requirements. He says  “It is important to understand your perceived cash flows to be ready for unforeseen expenses like medical costs  insurance coverage  job loss  pay cuts. Assets like gold have to be an essential part of the portfolio at least for 1 year to hedge against any uncertainties. Since valuations in the stock markets are still high  money can also be moved to debt for the short term needs. Lastly  exit strategies are critical hereon and need to be defined for all investments. Traditionally exits were aligned to markets or economy but they should now also be linked to life events  life cycle or whenever abnormal profits are made or every 3 to 5 years irrespective of the market cycle.” (This article is part of the HT Friday Finance series published in association with Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC),https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/reset-refresh-rejuvenate-how-approaches-to-financial-planning-need-to-change-post-pandemic/story-da3b3Pvai87lRVZuq39s4H.html

South Asia region stands to lose USD 622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario or up to USD 880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario  it said  adding while the regional loss is largely driven by India  all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP.    The report titled “Beaten or Broken? Informality and Covid-19 in South Asia” claims that South Asia is set to plunge into its worst-ever recession in 2020 as the devastating impacts of Covid-19 on the region’s economies linger. “Temporary school closures in all South Asian countries have had major implications for students. They have kept 391 million students out of school in primary and secondary education  further complicating efforts to resolve the learning crisis ” said the report. “While most governments have made enormous efforts to mitigate the impact of school closures  it has been difficult to engage children through remote learning initiatives ” it said.    The report also noted that the pandemic may cause up to 5.5 million students to drop out from the education system and cause substantial learning losses  which will have a lifetime impact on the productivity of a generation of students. “Most school systems closed in March  and -- though there are important exceptions -- countries are starting to reopen or have already opened their schools. Children have been out of school for approximately 5 months. Being out of school for that long means that children not only stop learning new things  they also forget some of what they have learned.    “The projected learning loss for the region is 0.5 years of learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS)  falling from 6.5 LAYS to 6.0 LAYS  an enormous setback from recent advances in schooling ” it said.  The ‘Learning Adjusted Year of Schooling’ (LAYS) concept  introduced by the World Bank  seeks to combine access and learning outcomes into a single measure.  It combines quantity (years of schooling) and quality (how much kids know at a given grade level) into a single summary measure of human capital in a society.    The report has projected that based on country data on household labor incomes  the average child in South Asia may lose USD 4 400 in lifetime earnings once having entered the labour market  equivalent to 5 percent of total earnings.    “These projections are based on what we currently know about returns to schooling  using the reduced level of learning caused by the crisis. Summing these numbers for all children in South Asia  the region stands to lose USD 622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario  or up to USD 880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario.    “While the regional loss is largely driven by India  all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP.

Much like other celebrities spreading awareness around the virus  Sania Mirza says it’s important as a responsible individual and human being that one get tested the moment there are symptoms.  “I don’t understand why a stigma needs to be attached to a virus. This is something that we collectively have to fight against. The moment there are symptoms isolate yourself  and inform local authorities. This isn’t something that you can take lightly. This is not just about yourself; we know how the virus is spreading. This is a war that we’ve as a human race against the virus and we need to put up a strong fight ” she says.  💞 🌊 @izhaan.mirzamalik A post shared by  Sania Mirza (@mirzasaniar) on Oct 7  2020 at 1:13am PDT Sharing her fitness regime she continues  “I’m still practising my game and exercise daily because working out is a part of my job too. I take out about two three-hours a day for pilates  do cardio and so on and so forth.” Ask about her plans of returning to the court and the 33-year-old says she will take some more time off. “I probably won’t play any tournament this year because the situation is still bad in the world and it’s difficult as a parent to travel with my child in such times… The situation is not in our favour and it isn’t easy to balance things out. And I have to think of myself both as a mother and athlete ” she adds. Last month at the US Open  tennis player Naomi Osaka sent out a strong message by wearing seven masks at the annual tournament voicing against racial injustice and advocate Black lives matter movement. Osaka’s gesture highlighted how important it is for celebrities to stand up for the right as their voice matter. Mirza says it’s all the more necessary in today’s time to drive the collective conscious towards a positive outlook.  “I think it’s always important for anybody who has a voice to stand up for the right for what they think that is right. And being athletes  we have a voice and a reach and following in some ways so we do have an added responsibility. And it becomes essential that we stand up for what we believe in  kudos to Naomi Osaka for what she did and how she did it ” she says.

10/10/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Shobha Deepak Singh on recovering from Covid-19: Jo Dara So Mara,Cultural impresario and director of Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra  Shobha Deepak Singh says one can’t stay afraid in these times.,As the festive season approaches  artistes are trying to reclaim the stage and take the pandemic head on. The fight isn’t easy  but the fighters aren’t giving up either. “Woh dialogue hai na: Jo Dara So Mara. So  darna nahi hai ” says Padma Shri Shobha Deepak Singh  director of Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK) in Mandi House  who recently resumed work after getting discharged from hospital where she was recovering from Covid-19.      “On September 20  I realised I was Covid positive  and soon got hospitalised ” says Singh  77  who had been working out of her office all through the lockdown period. “I used to go every day for two or two and a half hours. So when I got to know that I’m Covid positive  I was so sure that some artiste at the institute would also have got corona. We got 40-45 people tested  but nobody tested positive besides me and my husband (Deepak Singh). The doctor has been thinking  how is it possible ” she quips  adding  “But I wasn’t afraid. Some friends of mine even went abroad or to remote places because they didn’t want to get corona  and still got it. One has to take precautions  but can’t stay afraid.”    A few days back  when Singh resumed work in her office  she was surprised to find that nobody was available at the rehearsal for SBKK’s Ramlila  which has received Government’s permission to be staged. “Then suddenly all the dancers appeared on the stage with flowers  and started clapping. It was such a touching welcome... I have been missing the noise of ghungroos in the institute. During the pandemic  we shifted all classes online since the parents of foreign students were concerned about the health of their children. But  I had decided that the Ramlila would happen this year as well! Its first show was in 1957 and has been happening since; I didn’t want to give it a break. The only reason why it could have been cancelled is if the Government didn’t allow us ” says Singh reiterating how performing artistes have had a tough time due to the pandemic. “During May-June  the Kalbelia dancers who I have worked with in the past contacted me saying they have no money. And without thinking for a second I sent them whatever I could.”  One who is known to be averse to the very thought of recording live performances  choreographed by her  and cringe when people miss out giving credits  Singh has for the first time agreed to this year’s Ramlila at SBKK to get recorded. “What to do! In life you always have to go along with how the society moves. Although 100 people can watch it live at the open lawns now  we had earlier thought of an alternative incase we didn’t get the permission. The alternative was to record the whole performance from October 10 to 12  and upload the video on YouTube  from October 17 (when Navratri begins)  along with a ticker that says that its copyright lies with SBKK. Even now we’ll go ahead with this plan ” she adds.           Author tweets @HennaRakheja Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/shobha-deepak-singh-on-recovering-from-covid-19-jo-dara-so-mara/story-qYbFreW9lXWOxUB2R6mdrJ.html
04/10/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Daan Utsav: It’s time to celebrate the joy of giving,There is a joy in giving since an act of kindness leaves an impact on both the donor and the receiver.,There is a joy in giving since an act of kindness leaves an impact on both the donor and the receiver. This is the very basis of the week-long festival that’s Daan Utsav (October 2 to 8). And it’s all the more relevant to celebrate this since the pandemic has left many among us helpless. So cease this chance to impact lives  directly or indirectly.  The process of this annual event has taken a virtual route this year  to ensure people can participate from the comfort of their homes. Anjana Sharma  a Gurugram-based school teacher recalls  “I’ve donated to the NGO Goonj earlier  and this time as will I will be donating clothes and shoes for the underprivileged. It’s not just me but my entire group of friends who will be going there together to donate. I feel this festival of giving should be celebrated twice a year since it promotes kindness  and that’s what we really need in today’s world.”  JV Lakshmi  an NGO volunteer from Ghaziabad  says  “Last year  on the same day we had organised a similar camp. I got reminded of this by someone who came to donate; this shows the spirit of people.”  NGOs such as Goonj have started mobile camps where vehicles are collecting donations while following all Covid-19 protocols whereas some private companies are encouraging their employees to play online games.

25/09/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Farm bills anger spills onto highways  railways,Farmers protesting against farm bills blocked road traffic at several places in Punjab  Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh  only allowing movement of emergency services such as ambulances.,New Delhi/Chandigarh/Meerut   Farmers across several states protested over key farm reform laws  passed by Parliament this week  leading to disruption of life in Punjab  Haryana and parts of western Uttar Pradesh  even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the opposition parties of spreading “lies” and misleading the farmers for their own political benefit in a video message  the third time he has had to defend the legislations. In the truncated session  Parliament approved the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill  2020  the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill  2020  and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill  2020  leading to a protest by farmer bodies and opposition political parties. The primary points of contention are the absence of any mention of a minimum support price (the government-decided floor) and the freedom given to private players and others to operate in areas beyond the physical boundaries of  Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs).  Also read: Farmers have lost all faith in PM Modi-led govt  says Rahul Gandhi Close to 250 farmer bodies came together under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee on Friday for a national strike between 10am and 4pm  terming the laws as “anti-farmers” and asked the government either to withdraw these legislations or at least provide minimum support price (MSP) protection in them. The government has maintained that MSPs will stay and there was no reason for farmers to worry.  It has already announced MSPs for some winter-sown crops to reassure farmers who continue to insist that the support price protection be written into the law.  Farmers blocked road traffic at several places in Punjab  Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh  only allowing movement of emergency services such as ambulances. Road blockades in several places forced people to walk long distances to reach their destinations. The protest called by 185 farmer bodies was more or less peaceful with no major untoward incident reported from anywhere. According to Punjab government officials  a complete bandh was observed in all 22 districts  except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stronghold of Pathankot  with business establishments and public transport not functioning. Railways had already suspended about two dozen trains originating from or passing through the state in view of the three-day rail blockade observed by  farmer groups from September 24 to 26. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said he will not allow implementation of the laws in Punjab and directed the police not to book farmers for violation of Section 144 of CrPC imposed across the state for Covid management. Also read: Congress  NCP say no to farm bills in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena to decide In Haryana  a near complete bandh was observed in farmer dominated districts of western and central parts of the state with not much impact seen in the northern parts. Traffic was blocked on the Rohtak-Chandigarh  Rohtak-Delhi  Jind-Chandigarh and Ambala-Hisar highways. Additional police force was deployed at Ambala and Panipat railway stations  officials said. In western UP  farmer organisations blocked major highways including the Yamuna Expressway in the national capital region and Agra-Lucknow expressway. Road blocks were also reported from Ayodhya and some parts of eastern UP. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)  Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (KMS) and Rashtriya Kisan Sabha members demonstrated at various places. Political parties such as the Congress  Samajwadi Party  Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)  Trinamool Congress and the Left parties supported the strike and their workers participated in the bandh. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters in Jaipur that the Modi government has launched a brutal attack on the livelihood of 620 million people linked with farming at the time the country has been attacked by the Corona virus and China . Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav said the laws would enslave farmers to corporates and claimed that farm incomes have fallen in recent years instead of increasing as promised by the Prime Minister. PM Modi  asked the BJP workers to reach out to farmers on the ground and inform them about details and benefits of the new agriculture reforms and how these will empower them. “They (Opposition) are spreading rumours. Saving farmers from such rumours and explaining the importance of the agriculture reforms is the responsibility and duty of all BJP workers because we have to make the future of farmers bright ” Modi said at a function organised to celebrate the birth anniversary of party’s ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay. The PM said small and marginal farmers  who constitute 85% of the peasant community  will benefit the most from these reforms as they would get better price for their produce.  BJP leaders also held press conferences at various states capitals saying that  farmers were being misled by the Opposition. “The Rabi crop has not been harvested yet and they are saying farmers will not get the minimum support price ” said BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra  in Kolkata. “This kind of smear campaign will not work. The BJP government is committed to protecting the interest of farmers.”  Outside the food bowl of northern India  protests were also reported from West Bengal and Bihar. The ruling Trinamool Congress and the Left partied led the protests in West Bengal. Traffic was blocked in Hooghly  North 24 Parganas  Nadia  South 24 Parganas  Burdwan  East Midnapore and other districts where farming is the main source of income for the rural population. In Bihar  RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav led a protest  in Patna. Roads were blocked at Ara  Purnia  Samastipur  Bhagalpur  Begusarai and Hajipur districts  officials said. However  there was not much impact of the bandh in  states such as Maharashtra  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh  from where only sporadic protests were reported. Farmer bodies burnt copies of the laws at several locations and in Karnataka  entry of traffic into Bengaluru was blocked.

25/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,bangladesh;india;mali;oman,Review: Undertow by Jahnavi Barua,Undertow is about regret and reconciliation and about how conflict casts its shadow over generations,Jahnavi Barua’s Undertow is framed by minimalist — almost melancholic — stillness. This makes this novel  which was published in February this year before the world was silenced by the novel corona virus  unexpectedly prescient.  Loya  a young elephant conservationist  comes to visit her grandfather in Guwahati for the first time. She has never met Torun before — because her mother Rukmini was cast out of their family home for marrying her Malayali classmate. Rukmini’s mother had forbidden the match  but Torun had found middle ground: he helped his beloved daughter elope and then never spoke to her again to appease his formidable wife.  Now  25 years later  Loya has come to Assam from Bengaluru for the first time. She’s on her way to study the Elephas Maximus in Kaziranga — but first  she wants to discover her roots.  Undertow is about regret and reconciliation. Reading it is like sifting through a box full of old photographs and learning about the wordless people and places in them. Loya  still resentful  is a sulking guest — she wants answers but doesn’t want to ask Torun the questions. So on quiet afternoons  like a curious child she goes through things in her grandfather’s house: bookshelves with old government gazettes and books on folklore  old furniture  the pantry — to piece together her mother’s past  and making sense of her emotional inheritance. Undertow envelopes with its quiet beauty — especially in its descriptions of Guwahati and the Brahmaputra river. The Saraighat Bridge “looked deceptively fragile  a wisp of spun sugar against the grey sky.” On uncharacteristically hot September early mornings  “At that secret hour  dew softened the ground while the air still held  possessively  memories of the river at night.” Underneath all this softness is the dark undertow of anger — hard feelings are left unspoken but keenly felt. On her wedding day  Rukmini  angry at her mother  stood under the hot shower “Perversely… daring it to scald her  but all the heat did was stain her fair skin pink and draw out her anger until she was empty of it.”  Torun and Loya circle around each other’s hurts in silence until a mild confrontation. But this is not revelatory novel. It’s about how conflict casts its shadow over generations. Conflict is also at the heart of the story of Assam where most of the novel is set.  The politics of migration enters this novel subtly. Loya learns about Assamese identity through conversations around the Assam Agitation  the movement in the late 1970s and early 80s against undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants  “to expel illegal aliens  instead of arming them with citizenship and voting rights.” Last year  these protests were rekindled against the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act  which allowed undocumented non-Muslims immigrants to get citizenship. For protestors elsewhere in the country  the Act was Islamophobic and discriminatory. But in several north-eastern states and especially Assam  the protests were against the acceptance of any immigrants — in this case Bangladeshi Hindus — who they felt would threaten Assamese identity.  Torun tells Loya about the powerful Ahom dynasty from old Burma which ruled Assam for six centuries. They were not outsiders  he insists; they were migrants only in the way that everyone is in the beginning. But  “they settled down. Assimilated. Converted to Hinduism from Buddhism and married our local girls… the world was a different place in those days. Borders were more fluid and constantly refashioned by war.” Loya  the daughter of an exile straddling her multiple identities  is the counter argument for our evolving sense of identity.  Barua  a doctor by training  has previously written a collection of short stories  Next Door (2008) and a novel  Rebirth (2011)  about motherhood which was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and the Commonwealth Book Prize. Undertow becomes a part of an almost burgeoning literary movement which holds up a mirror and traces the political brewing in modern India. Annie Zaidi’s critically acclaimed novel Prelude to a Riot (2019) spelt out the sinking feeling of rising anxieties due to communalism and anti-immigrant biases. Madhuri Vijay delineates the Kashmir conflict in her multiple award-winning 2019 novel The Far Field  in which — like in Undertow — the protagonist is also a young 20-something woman from Bangalore who goes to Kashmir to look for answers to understand her mother.  During the Assam agitation  Barua writes  “bandhs were just that. Bandh. Everything closed  came to a grinding halt.” I read Undertow when the COVID-19 lockdown had just begun. I realized then that I had never experienced the sounds of silence before. As I read about Rukmini who had “lived through many of these suspended days when the city was inert with a silence broken only by the softest of sounds: the rustling of leaves in a mango tree as the wind passed through  the cawing of a crow from the top of a water tank  the muted chatter of a television.”  I could hear all of them.

21/09/2020,technology;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Restaurants  bars pin on IPL to bring some cheer!,,The commencement of Indian Premium League (IPL)  not only brought cheers to cricket fans but added a dash of excitement among restaurants  bars and clubs in the city. Reeling under corona virus fear  cricket lovers and partyholics are taking this as an opportunity for a safe outing.  With restaurants now allowed to operate till 11pm and with no weekend lockdown  some food joints and bars are providing IPL offers at their outlets while others are waiting and watching for the season to set in to announce their offers.  Club Momentz has placed a big screen on the pool side and is offering discounts on food items and beverages. “IPL viewing on big screen is our biggest attraction. Since opening day of the tournament we have started getting 10-15 table bookings. Our offers on food  drinks  cocktails and mocktail is working well. Besides  we launched ‘sign-your-bottle’ wherein the customer can own a bottle and use it during their next visits ” says Jugal Sachdeva.  Food aggregators are also using this opportunity on their apps. By using ‘Cricket’ code people can order dishes on Zomato and ‘Howzzat!’ on Swiggy to get discounts on selected restaurants.  At Royal Sky they have already started getting a good footfall during the matches  said the young restaurateur Jatin Ahuja. “As we are slowly recovering from the pandemic crisis  we are very upbeat about IPL this year. Like last year  we have come up with a screen display along with a range of 24x7offers for our clientele like 1-on-1  a free drink and more ” he said.  For software professional Abul Hasan it’s a win win situation as a customer  “I love cricket especially 20-20 format. As a ritual I do a watch a match or two at my favourite restaurant on big screen with my friends so this year too we are all game for it. Also offers at the outlets are a bonus for us.”  For the ongoing IPL season  The Beer Café Biggie is offering a 20% discount on their food and beverages  informed its operation manager Rishikesh Mishra.  RK Jaiswal  owner of Klub Bigg Boss and Suravi Restaurant said  “We are offering buy two and get one on food and drinks. It’s too early to say how it’s shaping up but we hope as the season progresses people may start visiting more. Covid fear is restricting people and if cases go down  I am sure it will pick up ” he said.  Traditional clubs are a disappointed lot as they have restricted operation till 9 pm. “Though the bars are allowed to open till 11 pm we have not been allowed to open restaurant beyond 9 pm. So  it’s not feasible to have IPL screening on big screen as it starts at 7.30 pm ” shared Ashok Agarwal  secretary Oudh Gymkhana Club.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/restaurants-bars-pin-on-ipl-to-bring-some-cheer/story-c4HqnPy3py5iVyITKUIIII.html
18/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Community centre in Begumpur Khatola to house Covid positive prisoners from Bhondsi Jail,,With at least 42 inmates at the Bhondsi district jail testing positive for Covid-19 since September 2  the district administration on Friday issued an order  instructing that an isolation ward for prisoners be set up at a community centre in Begumpur Khatola  about 15 kilometres away from the jail premises. Issued by Amit Khatri  deputy commissioner  Gurugram  Friday’s order stated  “Keeping in mind the spreading and upsurge of Covid-19  a necessity has arisen to keep and treat the Corona Virus positive prisoners and a proposal for the establishment of an isolation centre/dedicated ward... was under consideration. The task for identifying the suitable accommodation was entrusted to the SDM Gurugram and Superintendent  District Jail. They have reverted with their recommendation that the community centre in Begumpur Khatola is a suitable site (sic).” On September 2  33 inmates were found to be positive for Covid-19 at Bhondsi jail. Since then  67 more suspected cases of Covid-19 have been tested  of whom nine were found to have been infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus  thereby denoting a test-positivity rate of 13%. “Two hundred other inmates  who have travelled outside the jail premises recently for medical checkups or court proceedings  are currently in quarantine within the jail. They will all be tested for Covid-19. If found to be positive  we will move them to the government medical facility in Sector 9 for now. Once the community centre is set up  they will be moved there ” said Sanjay Kumar  assistant jail superintendent  adding that 35 of the 42 confirmed positives in Bhondsi so far have already recovered.  It was still unclear  however  how many isolation beds will be available for inmates  how many health staffers will be deployed there  or by when the facility will be up and running. Police commissioner  KK Rao  could not be contacted on Friday despite multiple attempts  while Dr Virender Yadav  chief medical officer (CMO)  did not share any specific details.  “We will comply with the deputy commissioner’s order as directed ” he said. Subhash Boken  spokesperson  city police  said  “Adequate security shall be provided at the isolation centre for Covid positive prisoners in Begumpur Khatola  especially during transportation from the centre and to the district jail and vice versa.” As per Friday’s order  the health department has been asked to provide “an adequate number of medical officers and other medical staff for treatment and examination of prisoners”  and to ensure that “testing of prisoners and submission of reports is done on a priority basis.”  Jail authorities  meanwhile  have been asked to depute staff for internal management and maintaining the records of prisoners admitted to the isolation centre. “Bedding  utensils  food and other necessities for prisoners” will also be provided by jail authorities. The sub-divisional magistrate  Badshahpur  has been tasked with ensuring adequate supply of electricity and potable water to the community centre  and to provide two vehicles for the facility. One will function as an ambulance for emergencies  while another will be used to transport food and other necessities for patient inmates.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/community-centre-in-begumpur-khatola-to-house-covid-positive-prisoners-from-bhondsi-jail/story-l6IlE8VXydbbxR1VIdm7vI.html
18/09/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;germany;india,London Confidential review: A murky virus conspiracy is the theme of ZEE5’s new spy-thriller,London Confidential shows the city in a completely different light as viewers get a peek into what a post-Covid world would look like and the anxieties attached with the threat of another pandemic from China,Cast: Mouni Roy  Purab Kohli  Kulraj Randhawa  Sagar Arya  Pravessh Rana  Jas Binag  Diljohn Singh Director: Kanwal Sethi Producer: Ajay G Rai and Mohit Chhabra Rating: 3.5 (out of 5) The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our world forever  almost overnight. It has altered the very way we live and interact with the world around us. With no end in sight to this chaos  and a majority of us confined to our living rooms as we embrace the new normal; the pandemic has expectedly become a premise for the latest original on ZEE5. The latest gold-star from ZEE5’s goodie bag  London Confidential  tells the story of two undercover cops Uma (Mouni Roy) and Arjun (Purab Kohli) posted at the London RAW station  who are trying to prevent another virus much deadlier than Corona Virus to spread across the border of China into India. Watch the trailer here. The virus is more aggressive and life-threatening than Corona and the RAW agents will go to any extent to expose the deadly conspiracy behind the origin of this virus and find incriminating evidence against major political links behind the mess China is plotting another virus attack and the plot gets murkier when another undercover RAW agent Biren Ghosh (Diljohn Singh) is trying to reach a Chinese informer for ‘vital information’ in the run-up to the coveted Conference of New Viruses. But he mysteriously goes missing. Uma and Arjun get on the trail and what follows is a series of brutal killings as they set off to expose the mole within their RAW set-up  who is feeding vital information to the political kingpins. The spy-thriller shows London in a completely different light as viewers get a peek into what a post-Covid world would look like and the anxieties attached with the threat of another pandemic. Talking about the experience  director Kanwal Sethi said: “This is the first OTT film to be shot in London post the lockdown phase. On one hand  it was a very challenging experience and a great learning experience to shoot in these difficult times  but at the same time  it was also a joy to work with a wonderful team. I really appreciate the team at ZEE5  Ajay Rai and Mohit Chhabra  who came together and decided to start filming. We have tried to show London under a new lens  like never before.”  The story also takes us into the lives of undercover agents  who are hidden heroes putting their lives at risk to protect the nation. Roy plays the glamorous spy with a tough task at hand. But as her character Uma fights the battle to unearth the origins of the new virus  she is fighting another personal battle. Her marriage with long-time boyfriend is on the rocks as she spent many weeks undercover in her starting out years causing a complete breakdown of communication in the wedlock. Officer Arjun is the rare RAW cop  who has managed to preserve his sense of humour despite all the bloodshed and hardship that he sees. He has the cover of working at a grocery store in London  and his own personal life is completely down in the dumps. Arjun has been on the trail of the some of the world’s deadliest criminals but his sense of humour has kept him going. “I am excited about my role as Arjun  who is a RAW agent. Action  spy  thrill and a mole in the system – I am looking forward to see what people feel about seeing me in this new avatar. Mouni is amazing and I feel all her millions of fans are in for a treat when they see her in the new role. I am sure the film will get the reach it deserves ” said Kohli. Roy added: “It is a spy-thriller franchise with a stirring plot and lovely characters passionate about what they do. Purab is a thorough gentleman and an absolute rockstar.

18/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Covid-19: HC asks Maharashtra if it was willing to make medicines available for critical patients,The bench of justice K K Tated and justice N R Borkar has directed the government to file an affidavit disclosing its stand on the issue by October 2,The Bombay high court on Friday directed Maharashtra government to disclose on affidavit if it was willing to make available the medicines required to support critical Covid-19 patients at government and private hospitals  wherever such patients were being treated. The bench of justice K K Tated and justice N R Borkar has directed the government to file an affidavit disclosing its stand on the issue by October 2. The directive came on a public interest litigation filed by a non-profit organisation complaining about black marketing of medicines for treatment of critical Covid-19 patients. In his plea  Jayesh Mirani  president of All Maharashtra Human Rights Welfare Association  has sought a direction to the state government to make Remdesivir 100   Actimera 400 injections and Fabiflu tablets available at the government and private hospitals assigned for treatment of Covid-19 patients and also at medical stores.  His counsel  advocate Prashant Pandey  claimed that the medicines were available only with six suppliers in Mumbai. Besides  people are forced to pay exorbitant amounts for these medicines  Pandey said. For example  he said  Remdesivir 100 injection has the maximum retail price of Rs 3 000  but is being sold in black market for over Rs 30 000  and therefore it was necessary that the injections and the tablet is made available directly at the Covid care centres. Government pleader Purnima Kantharia said one of the prayers of the petitioner was to also make the medicines available over the counter at medical stores and it will have to be seen if it was permissible and feasible. The bench posted the PIL for further hearing on October 6. Mirani  has said in his PIL that Maharashtra is the worst affected state in India  both in terms of Covid-19 infections and the number of deaths caused by corona virus. But  the state authorities did not place orders for these drugs approved for sale in India on June 22  2020  and bulk of the doses have gone to Tamil Nadu  Karnataka and Assam and private hospitals which had placed advance orders for the same.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-hc-asks-maharashtra-if-it-was-willing-to-make-medicines-available-for-critical-patients/story-Y3bLf11edESGQYBBSAstFO.html

07/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,greece,Covid-19 travel: Summer 2020 is European tourism’s leanest season amid pandemic,Unsure how long the pandemic will last  Bruges has already decided to forego any blockbuster exhibits. Instead  it will centre on local artists who have been hart hit financially by the pandemic. It includes a photographer tasked to show the solitude that COVID-19 has spawned in the city.,Bruges mayor Dirk De fauw first realized something was desperately wrong with European tourism when on a brisk March morning he crossed the Burg square in front of the Gothic city hall and there was nothing but silence. “There are always people. Always ” De fauw said. That morning? “Nothing. Nobody is on that large square” at the heart of one of Europe’s most picturesque cities  he said. Six months later  as Europe’s meanest tourist summer season in history is starting to draw to a close  COVID-19 is yet to loosen its suffocating grip on the continent. If anything the pandemic might tighten it over the coming months  with losses piling up in the tens of billions of euros across the 27-nation European Union  and the continent’s vaunted government support and social security system under increasing strain to prop up the sector. The upheaval so far  the bloc’s executive European Commission said  shows that “revenue losses during the first half of 2020 for hotels  restaurants  tour operators  long distance train operators and airlines were roughly 85-90%.” No country has been exempt in an area spanning from Greece’s beaches to the trattorias in Rome and the museums of Paris. And even now  the European Commission told The Associated Press  “bookings for September and October remain abnormally low ” as dire as 10% of capacity in Bruges. It dents hopes that a brief uptick in business in July would be a harbinger of something more permanent. Over the summer  though  came fresh spikes in COVID-19 contamination  new restrictive measures and regional colour codes that spelled disaster for local tourism when they turn red. It left the European tourism industry relying on hope more than anything else. It was all evident on a late summer’s day in Bruges  when usually throngs of American and Asian tourists should have been mixing with Europeans along the cobblestone streets below gabled houses to help boost the annual visit numbers to over 8 million in the city of 110 000. “The swans have it all to themselves ” muttered Michiel Michielsens as he slowed his boat behind a bank of swans who gracefully obstructed a quick passage on the canals. On a normal day — not like the one when he had 114 customers instead of 1 200 — tourists instead of birds would rule the waters. Now a boat could be seen showing a single couple around while normally 40 people fit in one. For tourists who can live with wearing masks for hours  there are some advantages. In Bruges  it extends to the city’s famed museums where the medieval Flemish Primitives take center stage. Instead of craning over other tourists flashing smartphones  any visitor could now be alone for minutes on end to study in detail one of Jan Van Eyck’s most famous pictures “Our Lady with the Child Jesus  St. George  St. Donaas and canon van der Paele.” All this is bittersweet to museum officials though. Across Europe  just about all have had to close for months early this year  and the outlook is bleak. Attendance has now slumped to a quarter of what it was in 2019 at Bruges museums. But during the uptick in July “we had 50%.” “So it’s declining gradually. Every month we see the numbers declining ” said Jonathan Nowakowski  the business director of Bruges Museums. “I can tell you that we’re looking at losses of 3.4 to 4 million euros this year ” all happening despite expectations being high in a Van Eyck memorial year with special exhibits. “We had we thought we would have had huge numbers of visitors ” he said. It all quickly trickles down to hotels  restaurants  shops and the survival of families. For those who own the building it is more manageable than for those who rent a building  since often those monthly payments must continue to come. With reservations down for the next months  some hotels will just close down  knowing the costs will never match up to the puny revenue. Others are using the low winter rates in summer. A great many put staff on temporary unemployment  and they acknowledge government aid has been a help. But they fear that will whittle down soon despite the 750-billion-euro recovery fund that EU recently agreed to. “In the next few months  we will see a lot of places that will go bankrupt. A lot of people will be unemployed ” said Luc Broes  co-owner of the hotel-restaurant Duc de Bourgogne  which overlooks a canal. Social protection  he said  only goes so far. “We also have to pay our rent for the building. We also have to pay all the staff. We have to pay the insurances. We have to — we are not protected. In the moment we can’t pay anymore  we will go bankrupt as well ” Broes said. Despite the 19th-century novel “Bruges-La-Morte” (“Bruges  the Dead City”) that turned the city into a metaphor of melancholy and decay  there is a steadfast conviction that people can turn this around — that tourism will survive. It is a feeling felt through much of the bloc and a special EU summit is already planned for early October on how to reinvigorate and reform tourism in general. Unsure how long the pandemic will last  Bruges has already decided to forego any blockbuster exhibits. Instead  it will centre on local artists who have been hart hit financially by the pandemic. It includes a photographer tasked to show the solitude that COVID-19 has spawned in the city. “They get funds. They get paid  They can survive  and we can offer the visitors something new  something inspiring without having all the logistical difficulties that corona(virus) brings ” Nowakowski said. The question of whether there will be more lockdowns  nationwide restrictions or limits on international travel still haunts everyone. Renowned chocolatier Dominique Persoone was lucky to survive on a big local fan base so he could do without the big cruise ship crowds that come and buy his chocolates from his shop  in the shadows of the cathedral. “The hardest thing is that you don’t know what the future will bring. We don’t know how it’s gonna be in September  October  when the real chocolate season starts. Then it’s Halloween  Santa Claus  Christmas.” Now  winter and more uncertainty beckons. “We thought we were safe and we had a wonderful life. And  now  this is happening ” Persoone said.

06/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,sudan;china;india;liberia;new zealand,Former health secy Preeti Sudan appointed WHO panellist,On Thursday  the World Health Organisation’s independent panel for pandemic preparedness and response appointed former health secretary Preeti Sudan as one of its  11 panellists from across the world.,On Thursday  the World Health Organisation’s independent panel for pandemic preparedness and response appointed former health secretary Preeti Sudan as one of its  11 panellists from across the world. The decision  by the panel’s two heads  former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clarke and former Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  received  a rather muted response in India.  HT learns that India recommended  former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale for this post. In a meeting of the Chairs earlier this week  Helen Clarke is believed to have conveyed that Sudan’s experience as the head of the government ministry that led India’s response to the pandemic makes her much more suited for the job.  Member states such as India were invited to nominate their candidates but the chairs had the freedom to pick their own candidate as they did with Sudan.  In its press release dated September 3  the panel said that while it reviewed more than 120 people  it “made the final appointments based on skills (including expertise in outbreak response  managing national health systems  leadership in youth and community engagement  socio-economic analytical capabilities)  knowledge about the international system including WHO and experience from similar international processes.’’ Significantly  the release added   “All panel members will serve in their individual capacity and will not represent either their government nor specific organisational interests.’’ The prestigious panel also has former UK foreign secretary David Milliband as a member. Their first meeting is on September 17 and in the report expected by May 2021  the panel is expected to address how the pandemic emerged and why countries were caught off guard. A senior government official  says  that Gokhale’s name was even cleared by the Prime Minister’s Office for several reasons. One of them is that Gokhale has served as ambassador to China  and  as foreign secretary   was an “expert on multi-lateral issues’’. India is among 62 nations that have asked for a probe into the origins of the Corona virus. US President Donald Trump has led the charge accusing China  where the outbreak started  of concealing information about the virus.  “I don’t know anything about this ’’ said Preeti Sudan on Saturday  about the background of her appointment.  “I didn’t apply for this position.’’ Sudan’s appointment was pushed by Clarke who  worked with the Indian officer on the board of The Partnership for Maternal  Newborn and Child Health. “I will be working from New Delhi in an endeavour that is for international good ” Sudan added. HT reached out to Gokhale  but there was no response till the time of going to press. The official cited above  who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed that Clark spoke with health minister Harsh Vardhan before making the appointment and explained the reason for vetoing India’s choice. Vardhan was appointed chairman of WHO Executive Board in May this year.  HT reached out to the Prime Minister’s office and Harsh Vardhan but didn’t receive any response.  A spokesperson for WHO said: “The selection of the members of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) was done by the co-chairs  former President of Liberia  Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the former Prime Minister of New Zealand  the Right Honourable Helen Clark. This decision was not taken by the World Health Organization. ”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-health-secy-preeti-sudan-appointed-who-panellist/story-aVLWeFwY2FLv0vaiDZKCHN.html
02/09/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Ghaziabad: Containment zone list not in public domain despite govt directions,,Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad  the list of containment zones that is prepared by the district administration is still not in public domain. The residents have complained that due to lack of proper information on containment zones they find it difficult to know about the areas which should be avoided.  The Uttar Pradesh government  in their three consecutive orders issued for Unlock 2  Unlock 3 and Unlock 4  has directed the respective district magistrates to put up containment zones’ list on the district’s official website and also send the same to the Union ministry of health and family welfare and the state’s health and home departments.  According to the official records  on September 1  the district had 336 containment zones with 842 active cases under category 1 (having single positive case) and category 2 (having more than one positive cases) zones. However  the number of active cases in the district on September 1 stood at 1 421  as per the state control room figures. Notably  the containment zones are created as per defined norms which have been issued time to time by the government.  “The list of containment zones in Ghaziabad is not in the public domain. We somehow used to get the list off and on during initial months when the number of zones was less. Now  with high number of cases  the number of zones is also on the rise. The working of the district administration is not transparent in this regard. It makes us think that whether the containment zones are managed properly or not ” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi  president of flat owners’ association.  “We often read in newspapers that the district has a particular number of containment zones. But nothing is known about the areas in which these zones are present. Whether they are sealed properly or not is not known to citizens or the civil society ” he added.  The neighbouring district of Gautam Budh Nagar  on the other hand  has been regular in updating the list of its containment zones. The official website of the district has a link -- gbnagar.nic.in/novel-corona-virus-covid-19/ -- where the list of containment zones are uploaded since July 1 and updated regularly.  In Ghaziabad  in one-off tweet from the Twitter handle of the district magistrate  a list was last shared on June 18.  “At present  on the ground the concept of containment zones hardly exists. The list is not in public domain for the use of residents to know which areas should be avoided. We have taken to social media and also contacted the respective incident commanders of the zones to provide us the list ” said Alok Kumar  founder member of the federation of association of apartment owners.  When asked about the issue  Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he will hold a review meeting on Wednesday evening in this regard. Pandey said he will ensure that list of containment zones is put up in public domain.  “It seems that there has been some laxity on part of some officials. I will hold a review meeting on Wednesday evening and will see to it that the list gets uploaded. A comprehensive review will be taken up during the meeting ” he added. According to the list accessed for September 1  the highest active cases  147  are under the jurisdiction of Sihani Gate police station where 46 zones are active. The next on the list is the Indirapuram police station area which has 77 zones with 142 active cases. Likewise  the police station areas of Sahibabad  Kavi Nagar and Vijay Nagar have 18  28 and 23 zones with 84  101 and 90 active cases  respectively.  The containment zones are created on the recommendation from the health department. Thereafter  the administration officials  called as incident commanders  are tasked to supervise the sealing and timely de-sealing of the zones.  According to UP chief secretary RK Tiwari’s order on July 24  the category 1 zones were revised to have an area of 100 metres radius as against 250 metres earlier. The category 2 zones were also directed to have an area of 200 metres radius as against the previous area of 500 metres  along with an additional buffer zone of 250 metres outside the containment zone. At present  defining the buffer area is left to the district officials on the basis of local assessment.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-containment-zone-list-not-in-public-domain-despite-govt-directions/story-XQY5GYbYoNhoHZLw1faNEP.html

22/08/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,US FDA-approved ointment found to treat  kill viral infections including Covid-19,The US company released the results of an independent laboratory evaluation of a topical medical formulation that mitigates coronavirus from entering the body through the nasal passages,A US pharma company has successfully tested a Food and Drug Administration-approved over the counter ointment as the first line of defence against the deadly coronavirus that has so far killed over eight lakh people globally.  Scientists associated with the project said the FDA-registered non-prescription over the counter (OTC) ointment has been proven to prevent  treat and kill viral infections including coronavirus.     “As per the lab report states  no infectious virus was detected after 30 seconds of T3X treatment ” the pharma company said in a statement. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “We believe this will be a breakthrough that will reduce the likelihood of becoming infected with coronavirus through the nose  which is where most cases are contracted ” said Dr Brian Huber  CEO and founder of Advanced Penetration Technology  which is based out of Indiana and Texas. “This is a big deal. It is the type of protection a lot of people have been hoping for and could be a first line of defence against the COVID virus.  It is a powerful and effective layer of prevention ” Huber said. He was speaking after the company released the results of an independent laboratory evaluation of a topical medical formulation that mitigates coronavirus from entering the body through the nasal passages  thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of people becoming infected with the virus. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) concluded that people contract Covid-19 and other viruses primarily through the nose. However  virus may still enter a body through the mouth and the eyes. “T3X is an FDA registered  over-the-counter formulation  which means that no prescription is needed.  It is easy to use and can be self-administered without the assistance of medical personnel or technicians ” the company said.    A London-based research laboratory  Virology Research Services Ltd  evaluated the anti-viral impact of the product  named APT™ T3X  against Corona Virus (NL63) and Influenza A virus and concluded that it is a highly effective formulation against coronavirus  it said.      The research concludes that APT™ T3X effectively neutralises viral infectivity within seconds.  The anti-viral efficacy supports the topical intranasal use of APT™ T3X to decrease the viral load of exposure.    “Under the conditions tested  APT T3X displays a 99.9% virucidal activity against human coronavirus NL63 ” the company said. Click here for complete coronavirus here  The testing was performed over two months  in May and June.  All definitive anti-viral assays were performed in triplicate  it said.    The product was initially developed eight years ago for resistant-bacterial infections  but its formulation additionally provides powerful anti-fungal and anti-viral therapies.  It has no documented side effects. However  patients diagnosed with Lyme disease should be aware of a potential “Herx” reaction shortly after use  the company said.

21/08/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Bombay HC to not interfere with compulsory Covid-19 test for those travelling to Konkan for Ganeshotsav,The bench said that effective steps need to be taken to contain the spread of the deadly infection  especially where transportation of citizens from one region to another is concerned,The Bombay High Court has refused to interfere with the directive of the state disaster management authority  making it mandatory for people visiting their hometowns in the Konkan region after August 12 for Ganeshotsav to undergo a Covid-19 test. A bench comprising justices KK Tated and Milind Jadhav upheld the clause in the Government order issued on August 4  2020  observing that it has been issued to ensure that the population of Konkan region stays safe and does not “get infected or come in contact with corona virus”. The bench said that effective steps need to be taken to contain the spread of the deadly infection  especially where transportation of citizens from one region to another is concerned. The bench then dismissed the petition filed by one Santos Gurav of the Konkan region. Gurav had moved the high court  represented by advocate Harshal Mirashi  contending that the government order  especially the clause making the Covid-19 test mandatory  had curbed his freedom to travel to Ratnagiri district in Konkan region for the festival. The test was mandatory irrespective of whether people travel in state transport buses or private vehicles and they would be allowed to travel only if the test result is negative  Mirashi pointed out. The high court  however  refused to accept the contention. The bench said if people travelled from one place to another to a different region or district  then there was a likelihood of the infection spreading and effective steps need to be taken to contain it.

Due to a spike in Covid-19 caseload in Lucknow  Divya Karan  another international medal winner  said she would also skip the camp beginning on September 1.  Besides Phogat and Kakran  the 15-member India team for the camp includes Nirmala Devi  Pinki  Seema (50 kg)  Pooja Gehlot  Lalita (53 kg)  Anshu  Sarita  Pooja Dhanda (57 kg)  Sonam  Sakshi Malik  Navjot Kaur (62 kg)  Nisha and Anita (68 kg).

In her message to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)  Phogat  the 53kg Asian Games gold medallist in 2018 and a two-time Commonwealth Games champion  has cited only health issues. Kakran said joining the camp would be risky.  “In my knowledge  there is a serious hike in corona cases in Lucknow and I don’t want to risk myself. I am satisfied with my training at the Guru Prem Nath Akahara (Delhi) as I have my own mechanism of safety here --- proper sanitisation  hand wash and other measures to keep myself protected from corona virus ” said Kakran  a bronze winner in the 68kg in the Asian and Commonwealth Games in 2018  on Thursday.  Lucknow has had over 16 000 cases and 200 deaths due to the novel coronavirus. On Wednesday  at 767 Lucknow reported the highest number of new cases in Uttar Pradesh.  “I have my brother as sparring partner and am getting good training. There is no use of such camp where out of 30 days you have to spend 14 days in mandatory quarantine ” said Kakran  the 2017 Commonwealth Championships gold medallist.  “Yes  Phogat has sent a message to the WFI  citing health issue  but so far we haven’t got any information from Kakran ” said assistant-secretary Vinod Tomar. “A committee under the chairmanship of WFI president Brij Bhushan Saran Singh will take a final decision on this.”  Phogat and Kakran’s decision comes days after six players tested positive on returning to the national camp for the men’s hockey team in Bengaluru. All six have been discharged from hospital. A camp for national shooters  scheduled in New Delhi from August 1  too has been deferred indefinitely due to Covid-19.  Tomar said there was no need to take the camp out of Lucknow. “Everybody in the world is facing problem with corona and I don’t see any issue to the Indian wrestlers in attending the training camp as all safety measures are in place ” he said.  Following a virtual discussion with India coach Kuldeep Singh  local authorities at the SAI centre have promised the ‘best’ arrangements. “All kind of safety kits  exclusive stay arrangements  24x7 sanitisation plan  setting up of additional CCTVs to keep a vigil on the campers (especially during the quarantine period) have been made ” said a SAI official.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/vinesh-phogat-pulls-out-on-health-grounds/story-Ges9D6IdA7UUE5t7fH1zzK.html
18/08/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Preterm and underweight Covid positive baby successfully discharged from Pune hospital after four weeks of ventilator support,The baby was under ventilator treatment for over 22 days and was successfully discharged after 35 days of treatment  says doctor,A preterm baby boy born weighing just 1.8 kg was admitted for over a month after being tested positive for Covid-19 at a private hospital. The baby could be the first such occurrence as the first preterm baby who was successfully discharged after undergoing ventilator treatment for about 22 days  including 100% oxygen requirement  in the state  according to the hospital authorities.  Although doctors could not confirm if this is a case of vertical transmission  they are reporting the case as the first of its kind in terms of multiple symptoms  including lung fibrosis  pneumonia in both the lungs and cytokine storm which are not usually reported in Covid-19 positive infants. Dr Pradeep Surawanshi  who was the treating doctor at Bharati Vidyapeeth University and Medical College and Hospital for the baby  said  “The baby was brought to us after delivery from another private hospital. He experienced breathlessness and was not responding to the normal treatment procedure  and so we got the baby tested for antibodies which tested positive for the Covid-19. The mother was also tested later and was found positive. The baby was born at 34 weeks and weighed only 1.8 kg. The baby was under ventilator treatment for over 22 days and was successfully discharged after 35 days of treatment. The baby is successfully breast feeding. This is a rare case because we observed cytokine storm and lung fibrosis  just like in case of adults. We will be reporting it to the Lancet publication as a first of its kind in the world.”  Neelima Suryavanshi  aunt of the baby said  “The baby was born on July 12 and the same day was shifted to Bharati hospital after experiencing breathlessness. It was a very critical case  but thankfully due to timely intervention the baby is now healthy.”  Dr Sanjay Gupta  former president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India said  “This is definitely a rare case and a positive one in that. However  the breathlessness in the baby could be because of either being born preterm and that the lungs were not fully developed and underweight or due to Covid.”  The case study report of the case states that “the breathing difficulty gradually increased over the next two days and the baby was put on a ventilator. The infant also received two doses of special medicine called ‘surfactant’ into the baby’s lungs to help the delivery of oxygen. In spite of this  baby required 100% oxygen and was put on a special type of ventilator called high frequency ventilator. The X rays were showing widespread pneumonia in both lungs and resembled the disease presentation as seen in adults with severe Covid-19.  “A special gas called nitric oxide was also used to help oxygen delivery. Baby also had all the blood investigations suggestive of the ‘cytokine storm’ and the antibody test for Covid-19 came to be positive in both baby and mother. It is noteworthy that mother never had any symptoms of Covid-19  except the fact that she had preterm delivery (which itself can be due to corona virus-2).  “A special therapy (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) which helps the immune system was also given. Due to the severity of the disease and after detailed discussion with parents  baby was given high dose steroids (methylprednisolone) for 5 days after which the baby started its gradual recovery. “The child remained on ventilator for 22 days out of which high frequency ventilator was given for 16 days. In modern day NICU care it is an exceptional event to require such a prolonged ventilatory care. Eventually the baby came off the ventilator on 25th day of life. At this stage  the CT scan of the chest showed some residual scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs  which has been recently documented in adult patients  who have recovered from the severe Covid-19. After few days of oxygen therapy during the recovery process  baby was discharged home on day 35.”  Dr Suryavanshi said  “This is a unique case of a preterm small baby  who suffered from severe Covid-19 disease and required almost 4 weeks of ventilatory support and heavy dose of steroids  which lead to recovery albeit with some residual damage. This kind of severe disease presentation has not been documented world over in preterm small babies. As we know babies have a tremendous potential to recover from any damage  much faster and better than adults  we hope with time  baby will eventually overcome the scars left by this dreadful disease.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/preterm-and-underweight-covid-positive-baby-successfully-discharged-after-four-weeks-of-ventilator-support/story-njiMrFEX5a3Kmdt0rQqGPM.html

A design inspired by a Thai temple symbolises people missing their favourite holiday destinations because of travel restrictions amid the pandemic.  A Hong Kong-based theatre actor and costume designer  Kok has had little work during the Covid-19 pandemic but used his creative juices as an opportunity in the now-ubiquitous fashion accessory  the face mask. Since February this year  he has crafted over 170 masks inspired both by the pandemic and Hong Kong’s political problems.

Under a new national security law  people have been arrested for displaying or chanting slogans deemed as advocating independence from China.

A security camera represents a fear of surveillance  and eyeballs  a fear of being watched or censored. “I really want to document different things that happened in our lives ” he tells Associated Press.

03/08/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,These corona warriors didn’t celebrate Rakhi with their families  so that we could,When we were celebrating the day with our families and having the best meals  these cops were on roads to ensure that they safeguard us against Covid-19.,While most of us had a blast celebrating Raksha Bandhan  the cops in the city couldn’t get their share of joy. Engaged in their duties all day long  they only focussed on work to ensure that the festival doesn’t end up becoming a bummer for the still prevalent rule of social distancing  and too many people don’t gather in one place.  Though most of them havd e received their rakhis via courier and were able to tie the threads from their sisters  but still missed the joy of being with their families. “The festival is virtual this year ” laughs Sanjeev Kumar Vohra  Delhi Police  Head Constable (HC) whose family lives in Himachal Pradesh. “It’s not new for us  we are quite habitual of not celebrating festivals with our families. But  this year we were also scared to visit them. Bas subah WhatsApp call kar lenge aur sabse baat karke waise hi celebrate ho jayega. In fact I haven’t been able to visit my family since past five months  and I miss my kids the most ” adds Vohra. Some of the cops who used to get rakhis tied by their colleagues’ families  feel nostalgic about the sweet gesture that has enabled them to extend their family. “We either tie rakhi to each other and eat sweets together or some school students visit us every year. But this year due to the corona virus  there weren’t any visitors. Families of other policemen who lives in Delhi are also like family to us... Last year one of my colleagues’ daughter tied rakhi on my wrist  and it strengthened my bond with my colleague ” says HC Dharanveer whose family lives in Uttar Pradesh.  Another reason that many couldn’t celebrate this festival with their families is the shortage of staff. “Many of my colleagues were  corona positive  and we are also prone to the virus since we had maximum exposure to it while on the job. So  since there was less staff on ground  it was difficult to get an off. And to be honest  it gave us immense joy to see others being able to celebrate happily. It felt that we are a part of their celebrations  and so we didn’t mind being away from our families. Duty sabse pehle hai nai ji ” says constable Rajeev Saroha whose family lives in Uttar Pradesh.

02/08/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;thailand,Swimmers fret over staying out of pools  say it’s taking a toll mentally,Swimmers in the country have not entered the pools since March 25  when the first coronavirus-forced lockdown was announced. The latest Ministry of Home Affairs’ guidelines on the third phase of easing lockdown restrictions still prohibited the use of swimming pools till August 31.,Their resumption of training still on hold due to government guidelines  elite Indian swimmers say the continued restrictions on use of pools will not only affect their performance in the next few years but is also taking a toll on their mental health. Swimmers in the country have not entered the pools since March 25  when the first coronavirus-forced lockdown was announced. The latest Ministry of Home Affairs’ guidelines on the third phase of easing lockdown restrictions still prohibited the use of swimming pools till August 31. Srihari Nataraj  who achieved the ‘B’ qualification mark last year in the 100m backstroke event with a national record 54.69sec  said this forced break has pushed back the careers of swimmers by almost a year  the effects of which will be felt in the Tokyo Olympics and the next Asian Games. “Had we been training  all of us would have made substantial progress. Now it’s going to take us at least 3-4 months to make the same amount of progress  setting us back by almost an entire year ” Nataraj told PTI. The 19-year-old needs to bring his timing down to 53.85secs to be sure of a Tokyo Olympics spot.”The things I would have achieved in March  I will achieve in December if I get back to training now. We are wasting a lot of time in our career. It will affect our performance in Tokyo Olympics  2022 Asian Games ” Nataraj added. Kushagra Rawat  who has achieved the ‘B’ qualification mark in the three events of 400m  800m and 1500m freestyle  said the lack of training opportunities was also affecting the Indian swimmers mentally. “Swimming pools have opened all over the world  so it keeps playing on our mind that they (who have started training) have improved their timings while we haven’t even been in a pool for four months ” Rawat said. “It is such a discipline that even if you miss out for a day or two  that impacts your performance. When I took a three month break for my 12th board exams it took me three months to get back to the earlier timings.”The Swimming Federation of India (SFI) has been asking for permission for the Olympic hopefuls to resume training since May  but to no avail. Dronacharya award-winning coach Nihar Ameen also expressed disappointment at the government’s decision to keep the swimming pools shut for the elite swimmers. “We keep getting promises that in the next unlock the pools will be opened. Swimming is one of the safest sports and if all the other sports including contact sports and gyms are open then why not swimming?” Ameen asked. Nataraj  Virdhawal Khade  Sajan Prakash  Rawat  Aryan Makhija and Advait Page are the six swimmers who have achieved the ‘B’ qualification mark in their respective events for the Olympics and are aiming for the ‘A’ standard. Out of them  Prakash and Makhija have been lucky enough to resume training. While Prakash  who spent the entire lockdown at an academy in Phuket  started training when the pools opened in Thailand  Makhija flew to Alabama  USA  where he is enrolled at Auburn University  in mid July. However  Nataraj  Rawat and Khade do not have any plans to go outside for training. “The only option for me is what the federation is planning. Others going abroad are already enrolled in universities. I don’t have that option ” Nataraj said. “I’m relying on federation as I can’t afford to train abroad. Apart from the cost there are also logistical issues ” Rawat said. Khade also said he will not travel abroad to train in personal capacity. Earlier this week  the SFI said it was looking to organise a training camp for its Olympic hopefuls outside the country.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/swimmers-fret-over-staying-out-of-pools-say-it-s-taking-a-toll-mentally/story-xlDrTKytugjQaQAAHYQh7O.html

Agarwal said this concession will be given only to those parents who have suffered financial crisis due to the lockdown.  “In this regard  a letter will have to be given by the parents in writing to the school management and on that basis parents will be helped ” he said. The office-bearers of the association have decided if such parents do not deposit fees even then  such students will be denied online education.  He also said all the schools of the association started online education in which a lot of money was being spent as no financial support had been provided by the government in this regard. Agarwal claimed that the unaided private schools had not increased the fee despite the fact all other expenses were being incurred by the schools.

26/07/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,mexico,Covid-19-weary Texas braces as Hurricane Hanna makes landfall,Hurricane Hanna roared ashore onto the Texas Gulf Coast  bringing winds that lashed the shoreline with rain and storm surge  and even threatening to bring possible tornadoes to a part of the country trying to cope with a spike in coronavirus cases.,Hurricane Hanna made a second landfall in Texas on Saturday afternoon. The first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season made its second landfall at around 6.15 pm in eastern Kenedy County  about 15 miles north-northwest of Port Mansfield. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph). Earlier in the afternoon  the storm had made landfall on Padre Island  about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Port Mansfield  which is about 130 miles (209 km) south of Corpus Christi and about 70 miles (113 km) north of Brownsville. Hurricane Hanna roared ashore onto the Texas Gulf Coast  bringing winds that lashed the shoreline with rain and storm surge  and even threatening to bring possible tornadoes to a part of the country trying to cope with a spike in coronavirus cases.  The hurricane made landfall around 5 pm CDT about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Port Mansfield  which is about 130 miles (209 km) south of Corpus Christi and about 70 miles (113 km) north of Brownsville.    As of Saturday evening  it had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph).  Many parts of Texas  including the area where Hanna came ashore  have been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks  but local officials said they were prepared for whatever the storm might bring.  Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb said Saturday that he had seen some residents doing last-minute shopping for supplies  but he warned that if that hadn’t been done already  people should stay at home and ride out the storm.  “We’ve been staying at home for five months because of the corona(virus). ... So staying home doesn’t sound real popular  but right now this is a real important matter ” McComb said  adding that residents should remember to wear masks if they have to evacuate their homes.  Steady rain fell Saturday in Corpus Christi and the winds got stronger. Sherry Boehme  who lives in a condo along the beach there  said the storm’s approach had increased the anxiety she has felt during the pandemic. The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease.  “It’s almost like a double whammy to us ” Boehme said Saturday by phone. “I think it’s made a lot of people nervous. ... We’ll get through it. Everybody is good and strong and sticks together.”    Boehme said she’d already felt 60 mph wind gusts at her condo and had seen a surge of water coming from the bay. Most people seemed to be staying home  as traffic was light  she said.  Judge Barbara Canales  Nueces County’s top elected official  said officials were highly concerned about storm surge that was already moving inland. Live webcam footage showed waves sweeping over popular Whitecap Beach near Corpus Christi hours before the hurricane was expected to make landfall.  First responders in Corpus Christi proactively placed barricades near intersections to have them ready to go if streets began to flood  McComb said.     More than 35 000 people throughout South Texas  including Corpus Christi  Harlingen and Brownsville  were without power early Saturday evening  according to AEP Texas.  Corpus Christi is in Nueces County  where health officials made headlines when they revealed that 60 infants tested positive for Covid-19 from July 1 to 16.  Farther south in Cameron County  which borders Mexico and where Brownsville is located  more than 300 confirmed new cases have been reported almost daily for the past two weeks  according to state health figures. The past week has also been the county’s deadliest of the pandemic.  The main hazard from Hanna was expected to be flash flooding.    Forecasters said Hanna could bring 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain through Sunday night — with isolated totals of 18 inches (46 centimeters) — in addition to coastal swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus  and Hanna loomed as the first big test.  South Texas officials’ plans for any possible rescues  shelters and monitoring of the storm will have the pandemic in mind and incorporate social distancing guidelines and mask wearing.  Gov Greg Abbott said Saturday that some sheltering would take place in hotel rooms so people could be separated.  “We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more catastrophically deadly event by stoking additional spread of COVID-19 that could lead to fatalities ” Abbott said.  Various resources and personnel to respond to the storm were on standby across the state  including search-and-rescue teams and aircraft. Mobile teams that can continue testing for Covid-19 were also being deployed.  Abbott said he has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in Texas and had asked the federal government to approve a similar declaration.  Tornadoes were also possible Saturday for parts of the lower to middle Texas coastal plain  forecasters said.    A hurricane warning remained in effect for Port Mansfield to Mesquite Bay  which is north of Corpus Christi  and a tropical storm warning was in effect from Port Mansfield south to Barra el Mezquital  Mexico  and from Mesquite Bay north to High Island  Texas.  Mexico’s northeasternmost states  coastal Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon just to its west  also took precautions ahead of the storm’s arrival. Tamaulipas was preparing shelters and disinfecting them to try to avoid spreading Covid-19  the state’s governor  Francisco Cabeza de Vaca  tweeted.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-weary-texas-braces-as-hurricane-hanna-makes-landfall/story-rDzjeTq8mHpCqm0ggcXcuN.html
20/07/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,brazil;india;japan;pakistan;saudi arabia,Review: Inside the Tablighi Jamaat by Ziya Us Salam,A narration of the origin and spread of the Tablighi Jamaat that has an excellent grasp of the psychology behind its success,It is an axiomatic tenet held by most believing Muslims that Muslims are not doing well in the world because they are not Muslim enough. On the other hand  most modern and progressive Muslims (read secular  scientific  educated) believe the community is backward because it is hopelessly hoodwinked by the mullahs and their regressive understanding of Islam. The mullahs  however  are convinced that the community is so steeped in carnal and material pleasure  now symbolised by the mobile phone  that it is indifferent to its true improvement. In order for Muslims to prosper  they aver  it is not enough for them to be more conscious of their Muslimness in matters of the world. They must practise a better Islam. True Islamic piety and glory in this world  it is asserted  go hand in hand.  These attitudes persist in spite of the fact that in the vast Muslim world today there are more mosques per capita  and more Muslims per mosque  than perhaps ever before in the history of Islam. More Muslims pray five times a day than have probably ever done before. This achievement owes much to the rise and influence of the Tablighi Jamaat. Founded in the 1920s by a Deoband-educated cleric Maulana Ilyas  it has been the Tablighi Jamat’s mission to make better Muslims of Muslims. Maulana Ilyas began his movement after he had a vision on a trip to Mecca that he must spread God’s word. He had his vision at a moment when undivided India was in the wake of intense religious wars spawned by the rise of revivalist movements such as the Arya Samaj. The Samaj propagated shuddhi and conversion to Hinduism  both new concepts  aimed at a general population rather than at individuals. The Arya Samaj believed  before the term ghar wapsi was invented  that most Indian Muslims were converts from Hinduism and they needed to return to the fold. But unlike the Arya Samaj  or other Muslim organisations  Maulana Ilyas steered clear of non-believers and concentrated on reforming Muslims alone. He inherited his well-off father’s madarsa at Nizamuddin in Delhi  where the Jamaat’s headquarters the Markaz now stands  and started sending his disciples out to different corners of India in order to acquaint Muslims with their faith and to call them to the mosque for prayer. His mission was simple: enlist men who would volunteer to travel to do dawa  to spread the word in modern missionary style  but he kept his focus on Muslims alone. They would teach uninformed or illiterate believers — the majority were both — the five basic principles of Islam  exhort them to emulate the Prophet’s exemplary life  and be regular in prayer and remembrance of God. If one feared and remembered God adequately  in the light of the practices of the Prophet  then no worldly privation would matter. From this humble beginning the Tabligh network has today grown so vast that it has an imprint in nearly 150 countries  including such faraway places as Japan and Brazil  with adherents and activists running into millions. It was the Tablighi ideology that made the Pakistani cricket team adorn the particular Tablighi look — long kurta  long beard  shaved moustache  skull cap — and attitudes for nearly a decade. It was the Tablighi mindset that made the Pakistani pop singer Junaid Jamshed give up his profession and devote himself to spreading the word. Thus it was that thousands of foreigners had landed at the Markaz in Nizamuddin in March for its annual gathering before the unfortunate events surrounding the lockdown and the infections they spread catapulted them to world notoriety. Ziya Us Salam  the author of this book  a senior journalist with The Hindu  who  interestingly  started his career as a film critic  has written five other books on various aspects of modern Muslim life in South Asia. He narrates the origin and spread of Tabligh with an insider’s lucidity and has an excellent grasp of the psychology behind its success. Remarkably  he began this book after the Tabligh became mired in controversy in March and has finished it in no time. The haste has not impaired the quality of the book. Strictly speaking  as Ziya shows  the Tablighi Jamaat is not an organisation  unlike  say  the Jamat-e-Islami or the Jamiat-e-Ulema  the other two better known modern Muslim organisations of South Asia. It does not have a membership roll  it seeks no details from its adherents  it doles out no salaries. It is an entirely voluntary organisation and works in small groups that radiate across the world from the centre. It has a simple organisational principle: a few members will knock a few times on a brother’s door and exhort him to come to the mosque. When I lived in Delhi’s Batla house during my student days I had encountered many such visits. (At one time  in Aligarh University  such visits would provoke unresponsive students to lay bare posters of Samantha Fox and Brooke Shields in their rooms on the pious missionaries.) In the mosque  the believers are asked to stay back after prayer to discuss matters of faith. Once a brother has become a regular he is invited to visit another mosque for three days at his own expense as part of a group. This is followed by a 40-day visit to a different part of the country. The final rite of passage is a four month trip  within the country or abroad. Most such trips are self-sponsored. The volunteers stay at mosques  travel and live frugally  and maintain a spirit of egalitarianism  regardless of background. Women are kept out; their role is to be a good homemaker. Its membership includes Muslims from all walks of life  including university teachers  engineers and professionals. Many make such trips several times a year and for several years.  One of the reasons for the outstanding success of Tabligh is that it has kept its teachings very simple. It emphasises the correct way of performing ablutions  the correct way of dressing  the correct way of offering namaz  and the correct teachings of the Prophet. It has its own sets of books the Fazail-e Amal  a compendium of stories and anecdotes extolling the life of the Prophet and the early Muslims  and sets of prayers for different occasions such as illness  accident  job  marriage  business ad infinitum. The Tabligh doesn’t encourage its practitioners to read or reflect on the Quran  in fact it doesn’t much emphasise the Quran and instead gives primacy to its own book and to the emulation of the Prophet’s ways. As the scientist and science populariser Dr Aslam Parvez says  “the Quran teaches to question  to explore  to reflect  by over emphasising the Prophet and the Hadith they downgrade the Quran.” Ziya us Salam and the other myriad modern Muslims he quotes in the book are deeply unhappy with the Tabligh and its ethos. The Tabligh is almost banned in Saudi Arabia. They are unhappy that the Jamaat has reduced Islam to a set of rituals. It has no interest in philosophy  in politics  in the deeper truths that the Quran offers. It has reduced the practice of Islam  an all-encompassing faith  to a set of rituals in a mosque  whereas for a good Muslim everything in life is an act of worship and remembrance of God. There is no separation of the realm of scripture and the realm of the world as such. The Jamaat also encourages belief in things that ‘true’ Islam abjures  such as the power and charisma of the graves of holy men. It wastes too much energy in disputations about the correctness of rituals. Entire theses have been written on the importance of wearing the right dress  washing up in the correct way  the correct area to gaze at while praying  and the correct way to raise your index finger. Its critics claim that it denies the true spirit of Islam by not allowing women inside mosques and by not encouraging their wider participation in civic and public life as shown in the early history of Islam. It has nothing to say on social and political questions affecting Muslims like the triple talaq or the Babri Masjid issue in India  and generally presents a conservative and unappealing picture of Islam to believers and non-believers alike.  VS Naipaul acutely noted in his travels through Islamic countries  many different kinds of anxieties beset the faith of modern practising Muslims. Unlike many other religions  worship in Islam is formal and rule bound. To pray is to pray correctly  otherwise one risks the non-acceptance of one’s prayers  irrespective of the spirit of the offering. While one offers namaz to Allah alone  there are enough human authorities who can intervene and say aapki namaz nahi hui ie the namaz was not performed properly  and hence will not be accepted. And since it is obligatory to pray five times a day  forfeiting any one of those could risk forfeiting one’s place in paradise. And it is paradise that one is after  since that it is all that matters  so one tries to earn enough merit  sawab  by praying correctly and praying enough and uttering the right prayers and incantations. This approach underplays the importance of good deeds. But in spite of its simplification  it is not easy to be a good Muslim  because there are so many things you could do wrong. Despite praying five times a day you could lack in charity  lack in piety  lack in humility  lack in compassion  lack in submission  lack in trust  lack in faith  lack in devotion  and lack in sincerity. The Quran’s lofty and majestic tone  its exhortation to reflect on God’s beauty  his wondrous creation  his immanence and universality is of no good here  because one is after being correct and that is why the life of the Prophet  his ways  his tradition  his utterances  the Hadith  in short  are of paramount importance. In practice  the Hadith is often much more important than the Quran. The fact is that few practising Muslims actually read the Quran or grasp its meaning. They are content with reciting it in Arabic  as they are content with praying in Arabic  despite not understanding anything  because what they are doing is the correct thing since  they maintain  the Prophet did it like this.  And so this approach centralises the life of the Prophet and therefore the primacy of many different kinds of compendia of Hadith and their various interpreters and the liturgy who then laid down dos and don’ts  which then necessitate intermediaries in the form of the Ulema  the clerics to instruct the lay believers on how to go about our religion. The Tabligh bypasses the Ulema to a significant extent by allowing everyone to find their own simplified version of Islam. But it does more than that. It lays down a path of prayer  piety and righteousness  since it is not this but the next world that is important. That is why it has succeeded in presenting itself as a kind of life coach to many wayward men around the world. Undoubtedly  the Tabligh  and now the internet  has helped democratise the practice of Islam as the nature of authority changes. In many fundamental ways  the Islam that we now practise around the globe is the Tablighi understanding of Islam. But we must remember that Islam had begun to be purified and cleansed even before the Tabligh was born. The colourful Indic Islam with its pageants  its remembrances of local deities  its adherence to a local calendar had already been purified  and hence impoverished  by the more scripture-oriented  and very modern seminary of Deoband. Moreover  in its insistence on emulating the ways of the Prophet  the Tabligh is not alone. Many modern Islamic movements have emphasised a return to the basics  to the fundamentals of Islam as seen in the golden age of the Prophet and his immediate successors. The purity of the early founders is a constant source of inspiration and Islam’s early success and its quick spread is often seen as a validation of that purity and chastity. Many Muslims seem bewildered when faced with the liberalism of the Quran and the rigidity of the rules espoused by the orthodox scholars. But all seem convinced that there is a true Islam  an essence  that is somehow independent of its practitioners. They are quite emphatic that Islam is not what Muslims do  but many Muslims do what they think is Islam. What lies between the Quran and the believers is not just an alien language  or history  but also mediators  who are not easy to wish away  and that is where disagreements begin.  On one thing there is complete agreement between all the different kinds of Muslims in the world and all the others who condemn them: Muslims are desperately in need of reform. Moderniser  secularist  liberal  orthodox  radical  all shades of Muslims are unhappy with Muslims. This has been the state of affairs all over the world for the last 200 years at least. ‘The Muslims have a problem’ and ‘the Muslims are the problem’  this twin credo is shared by Islamophiles (Indian secularists in short)  and Islamophobes alike. This internalisation of Islam’s shortcomings is not much different from many Hindu reformers’ deep dissatisfaction with myriad aspects of their religion. However  if religion could be wholly rationalised then why would one need faith? In our deep urge to reform everyone  in order to make them a model liberal subject as seen in the Camelot of western democracy  we often forget that religion exists not to make sense to rationalists but to provide meaning to its adherents. The popularity of Tablighi Jamaat seems to suggest that it has been doing a good job of that.  Mahmood Farooqui is a Delhi based writer who is best known for reviving Dastangoi.

He recommends staying hydrated through the day by sipping boiled water with dried ginger  and adds  “Nasal drops of mustard oil are also proven to counter all infections.” Binge on citrus fruits: Fruits are the gateway to better immunity as they are a powerhouse of fibre and nutrients such as vitamin C. “Apples  guava  amla  orange  berries and pomegranates – add any or all to your diet for more energy and vitamins ” adds Dr Gupta. Homemade cough lozenges: To avoid having an itchy throat  make medicinal tablets at home. Some of the easiest recipes use powdered cloves  lime juice  ginger and amla. Boil these and honey or sugar after switching off the burner. Then pour drops of the liquid in a pan so as to make tablets. A cuppa a day: “To make your daily beverage an immunity booster  simply add a spoonful of turmeric to tea. This root spice has antioxidant properties while being antibacterial and antifungal in nature. Infusions made with tulsi  black pepper  ginger and amla are great for bolstering immunity ” says Tanuja Sodhi  a Mumbai-based wellness expert.  Ghar ki Khichdi: “During monsoon  prefer eating fresh home cooked food to avoid any infections. Consuming light and fresh foods prepared from barley  rice  or moong dal and having a small piece of ginger with rock salt before every meal are some quick and effective ways to boost your immunity naturally without much effort ” says  Akanksha Mishra  a Delhi-based food and nutritionist. Two word mantra - sleep and exercise: “You need to sleep for 7-8 hours a day because a good sleep is therapeutic and helps the body recover from the day’s exhaustion ” adds Sodhi. She also suggests moderate exercises to keep stress at bay.

18/07/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;cambodia;thailand,The Taste with Vir: The Covid Puzzle,The more we live with the virus the less we seem to understand how it strikes.,When Amitabh Bachchan tweeted that he had Covid  my reaction was the same as that of most people: shock  concern and a silent prayer that the actor would fight the Corona virus as effectively as he has fought the various health issues and ailments that have plagued him over the last 50 years. But  I also had a second concern. How  in God’s name  had Amitabh got Covid? He is one of the most fastidious and careful people I know. His son Abhishek (who also tested positive a little later) had said in an interview  that they were extremely mindful of the possibility of infection at their homes. They used physical distancing and masks when they went outside and when they came back they changed their clothes immediately. Moreover  anything that came from outside was quarantined before being used.  The case of the Bachchans confirmed what I have been increasingly feeling over the last fortnight. The more we live with the Covid virus  the less we seem to understand how it functions. And  sadly enough  there is an element of destiny to its choice of targets. If you are going to get it  well then  you are going to get it. As of now  the medical community is locked in a dispute over how the virus spreads. The traditional view is that the infection spreads by droplets. If anyone with Covid coughs  sneezes or spits (while talking  shouting or laughing  for instance) and you inhale or ingest the droplets then you could get infected. Hence the six feet distancing rule: the droplets are quite heavy and don’t travel far. But  doctors say  these droplets could fall on surfaces. So  there is a danger of a two-step infection. You touch a surface on which a Corona virus filled droplet has landed . Later you touch a part of your face that is connected to your respiratory system: say  your mouth  nose or eyes. The virus can enter your system that way. Hence the instruction to wear gloves and to keep washing your hands. And then there’s the mask controversy. For weeks into the pandemic  the WHO and the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) kept telling us that masks were necessary for medical professionals but not for the rest of us. This always struck me as odd. How could a mask which protected a doctor or a paramedic suddenly become unnecessary when you and I wore it? After many influential people asked those questions  the WHO and CDC reversed their policy and said that everyone needed to wear masks. So why had the early advice been so different? Appearing before a US Congressional Committee  Dr. Anthony Fauci  head of the US responses to Covid (till Donald Trump fires him  which could be any day now) explained that masks were always useful. They just didn’t have enough of them and did not want to increase demand so greatly that medical professionals could not get enough. This may or may not be an appropriate explanation in the US context but for the WHO to make this a global recommendation is unforgivable. Every other country in the world was not short of masks. In India  for instance  we have ramped up production at an incredible speed. And even if there was a shortage of masks  should doctors have lied to us? My guess is that the shortage of masks was only one of the reasons for the CDC and WHO advice that lay people did not need to wear masks. They genuinely believed that social distancing was enough. At one level  this made sense. If a droplet can only travel a short distance and you ask people to stay six feet away from each other then why do you need masks? Only health-care workers who can’t stay six feet away from patients are at risk from the droplets. But they made one serious miscalculation. If everyone wore masks  then the people who were Corona positive would not be able to expel the virus into the air. So even if masks were not necessary to protect the uninfected  they were certainly required to prevent the infected from spreading the diseases. The current controversy goes beyond masks and focuses on the methods of transmission. Some researchers have said that while droplets do not travel more than six feet  there are micro droplets which are lighter and can float through the air  travelling a greater distance.  The medical establishment countered this with two arguments. First of all  they said  all the studies that showed micro droplets travelling far into the air were based on experiments that required the virus to be expelled into the atmosphere from some kind of machine. But in real life  the human body did not expel them with so much force so the experiment did not mirror reality. A second argument was that there was no evidence that the micro droplets were infectious or contained enough of a viral load to pose a threat. Over the last week  the WHO has moderated its position and allowed for the possibility that there might be micro-droplets in the air and that they might be infectious. If this is true  it re-emphasizes the need for masks. But  more significantly  it also calls into question all social distancing policies. If the virus travels through the air  then a six foot perimeter is not enough. Which suggests that you can’t ever go out in public without a mask.  Also up for debate is why the virus behaves differently with different people and environments. It is now clear that the Indian lockdown  one of the strictest in the world  did not prevent the spread of the disease: we have just crossed a million cases. But did it help at all? That’s hard to say because the government made it so difficult to test yourself for Covid. We don’t know how much the disease spread during the lockdown or even how many cases there really are because we are testing a much tinier proportion of our population compared to many other countries. Of one thing though  there is no doubt. Covid is killing a smaller proportion of those it infects in India than it does in many other countries. Our current death rate is around 2% which is very low by global standards. And if you believe  as most doctors do  that the total number of people infected with Covid is (at the very least) double the official figure  then the death rate hovers around one per cent or so. Why can so many Indians fight the disease more effectively than say  Americans ? We don’t know. It could be  as one theory has it  because the BCG vaccine which we take as children gives us immunity. It could be that a less virulent strain of the virus is spreading through India. Or it could just be that we have a younger demographic  which is not as much at risk. Everyone has a view. But nobody knows for sure. But the Indian example pales beside some East Asian countries. Thailand is a huge tourist centre. Bangkok alone gets many times the number of visitors than the whole of India. So you might expect it to be badly affected by Covid. Wrong. Thailand has recorded under 3240 cases in total. (Compared to a million for India!) There have been only 58 deaths. Some of this has to do with the fact that Thailand is a small country. (But European countries of the same size have fared much worse.) And yes  the Thai authorities have handled the pandemic much better than we have.  But even so  the figures are startlingly low. Could there be some kind of genetic resistance? Because Vietnam is even better off than Thailand. It has not recorded a single death. Burma has had just 336 cases  Cambodia has recorded 168 cases and Laos has had 19 cases. I have not read a single convincing medical explanation of South East Asia’s low rates or of our encouragingly low mortality rate. But then that’s typical of this pandemic. The longer it rages  the less we know about the virus. And until a vaccine appears (by the end of this year  I think) we will all still be floundering in the dark.

16/07/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,41% of Jharkhand’s total Covid cases reported in first two weeks of July,July’s second week  however  has felt the maximum turmoil as the number of cases detected was double the cases discovered in the first week.,In the ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic  Jharkhand has entered into another turbulent phase of case explosion in the first two weeks of July  which witnessed 41% of the state’s total cases. In this month’s first two weeks  the state reported 1 756 cases. The period also saw 21 deaths that took the toll to 36. July’s second week  however  has felt the maximum turmoil as the number of cases detected was double the cases discovered in the first week. While 566 cases were detected between July 1-7  1 190 cases were reported between July 8-14. Besides  the positivity rate of the disease  which is the number of samples found positive out of the total samples tested  also increased in the period to 3.7%  thereby meaning that of the 100 samples tested during this period  an average of 3.7 people were found infected. The period also saw pandemic hitting almost every section of the society and even reached the corridors of power  infecting lawmakers  government officials  doctors  police personnel  journalists and others. The maximum spread of infection in this phase was felt in city and town areas as districts with a sizeable urban population remained the worst-affected. The top five worst hit districts are East Singhbhum (with its headquarters in Jamshedpur)  Ranchi  Dhanbad  Koderma and Hazaribag  which reported 309  272  139  130 and 108 new cases respectively in the last two weeks. Ranchi registered the maximum 122% growth as cases jumped to 494 on July 14 from 222 on June 30. The steep surge in number of cases in urban pockets  however  has created a panic  especially after chief minister Hemant Soren and his entire staff went into home quarantine following his contact with an infected minister. Another alarming development came on July 12  when the state reported nine deaths due to the pandemic. According to health experts  the situation can worsen if people don’t start following all preventive protocols and guidelines. “Many people are still violating the norms. Some even don’t use masks. A majority of population has not downloaded the Aarogya Setu App ” said Dr Rakesh Dayal  state nodal officer of the integrated disease surveillance programm (IDSP). Former head of medicine department of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS)  Ranchi  Dr RK Jha said  “Prevention is the only key to keep a check on the spread of pandemic. We have to prepare ourselves mentally as we are in it for a long haul. We have to understand the importance of using masks  maintaining social distancing  using sanitizer and washing hands frequently.” In order to put a break on spread of the disease  several district administrations have been taking stricter measures and passed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Some districts have also clamped complete lockdown for a week.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/41-of-state-s-total-covid-cases-reported-in-first-two-weeks-of-july/story-wn3NRr7Waoh2i27f4P3U9I.html

Prof SW Akhtar  the vice chancellor of the Integral University  said arrangements for Covid -19 patients had been made as per the guidelines of the health department. “We had to wait outside as there was confusion about bed availability and then inside the compound too  before we could climb up to the third floor. All this might have been forgotten had we got at least a comfortable quarantine place. But the atmosphere forced us to look for an option ” the elderly woman said. Since there was no one to ask about an option on the same campus  the elderly couple then made efforts to come out of there. “We stayed some three hours and in that time we could just imagine how life would have been had we stayed there for long. There were people sitting and playing cards in groups without any medical monitoring and just a fan at a distance from our bed. All this was horrible for us ” said the elderly woman. “There was no medical staff inside to guide us to the bed. In fact  they just showed us the door on the third floor and we had to enter that to reach the hall ” said the woman. They reached this place at 6.20 pm on Sunday and their agony abated a little at around 10 pm when an ambulance came to shift them. “They have now put us in a semi-finished hospital where we have two separate beds in a room with attached bathroom and an air conditioner running ” she said. “In fact it was better for us to remain in home quarantine instead of moving out as we could have recovered faster at our own house  following all the rules and protocol ” she said. “I had asked the health officials to allow us to stay at home since we had no other health problem but they insisted we go with them. We expected some facilities as senior citizens and former central government employees but we got nothing ” said the woman. Prof SW Akhtar said  “The entire facility has been developed under guidance of the health department. It may be possible that people look for facilities they have at home. But we have made everything as per the protocol by the health department and all facilities directed by the health department are available.” He said that at present  there were 100 Covid -19 patients and they were being taken care of. “We have medical teams deployed at the facility and they keep monitoring the patients ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/state-of-quarantine-facility-gives-a-jolt-to-elderly-couple/story-akNqFkoSMP0WVS1fLOAk8L.html

In case schools remain shut in August and beyond that  it will mean a further reduction in working days and the department will be forced to reduce the syllabus.

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was hearing a plea seeking action against ashrams (religious retreats) run by fake spiritual gurus  which have allegedly confined inmates  particularly women  in unhygienic conditions  risking the spread of the coronavirus disease.  “There is a lot of money involved and criminal activities are happening. See what can be done? This kind of practice gives a bad name to everyone ” CJI Bobde told the central government’s second senior-most law officer  solicitor general Tushar Mehta.  The petitioner  Dumpala Ramreddy  was asked by the apex court to provide Mehta with a copy of the petition so that he can suggest solutions to deal with the problem.  Reddy approached the top court in April alleging that his daughter was confined in the Adhyatmika Vidyalaya Ashram at Rohini in Delhi founded by Veerendra Dev Dixit  who has been absconding since 2017 after being charged for raping a minor girl in 1999. Reddy submitted that central and state governments were not taking action against fake babas and were allowing such illegal ashrams to function  often from unauthorized premises.  “Considering the urgent prevailing situation due to spreading of Corona virus in the country particularly in places where social distance is not maintained….the petitioner prays for the intervention of this Hon’ble Court for the rescue of the women/persons in the ashrams ” the petition stated. The petitioner also sought guidelines to be laid down to govern the establishment and functioning of such ashrams and to close down those run by people with criminal records. He also cited a list released by the Akhil Bharatiya AkharaParishad  a body of Hindu religious ascetics  declaring 17 babas including Veerendra Dev Dixit  Asaram bapu  Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and Radhe Maa as fake religious gurus.  Even so  ashrams run by the 17 people  Reddy contended  are continuing to function with thousands of disciples residing on their premises.  “If this man (Reddy) saysthe Akhara has declared that there are 17 ashrams that are fake  it raises serious questions ” the bench remarked.  Reddy sought the evacuation of inmates from the ashrams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “The authorities are not verifying the facilities available in the ashrams and the ashrams are in very poor condition. They do not have basic amenities and conditions are very unhygienic”  the petition said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-babas-bring-disrepute-to-real-spirituality-sc/story-AbrszxUbqfdP60Zl5qKieP.html

01/07/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Eyeing a govt job  rowers struggle in the absence of training,,Sports has been known to get recognition as well as job in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Be it the government-run sports hostels or sports colleges or private and government academies  the aim is to get their sportspersons a suitable job  especially in the government sector. Uttar Pradesh has been a nursery for sports quota recruitment in police  railways and even in armed forces across the country and going by the record so far  an umpteen number of sportspersons from the state have been serving the country in various capacities. It’s an uninterrupted process since long but the pandemic COVID19 has put breaks on this process. Latest on the list of such sufferers are 60-odd rowers  based in Allahabad  Kanpur  Varanasi and Lucknow  who have been struggling to get trained before taking up jobs mainly in defence services.  Despite being not a fully ‘contact’ sport they haven’t been allowed to train in the water and the Uttar Pradesh Rowing Federation has urged the government to allow them to do the training so that they could prepare for jobs. “Unlike swimming and gymnasium where chances of getting infected with corona virus  rowing doesn’t have that much of a problem as rowers with single and double scull could be allowed by the government  but there is no response to our appeal so far ” UP Rowing Association’s secretary  Sudhir Sharma said on Tuesday. “Our rowers have already lost important three months of training due to the coronavirus and now the rainy season is all set to give little time to rowers to get ready for the trials for jobs in October-November ” said Sharma  who has been trying hard to bring professionalism in the UPRA ever since he took over the reins in 2018. The 44-year old UPRA  which came into existence in 1976  has its existence at the Boat Club in Nishatganj here at the banks of river Gomti with the availability of 16 international standard boats  including four single scull  four pair  four double scull and four-four. “We could get these boats under the government’s scheme  where the remaining expenditure of 50 percent was born by the Rowing Federation of India.” In fact  the season for rowers in India was due to start in July with the conduct of sub-junior nationals at Kolkata  followed by junior nationals at Pune in August and senior nationals at Bhopal in October. “Successful rowers at these championships get a good attention of government organizations  who recruit people through sports quota but due to the corona now things look almost bleak ” said  Sharma. After a long time  two youngsters from the state  Yuvraj Singh Yadav and Himanshu could finish fourth at the sub-junior nationals at Pune in the under-13 category in 2019  whereas Allahabad’s Shivam Nishad lost out in the semi-finals only in the under-15 category. But the real achievement for UP came at the senior nationals at Hyderabad when the duo of Manish Singh Yadav and Akshat won a bronze medal in 500m men’s pair event. In 2018  Kiran Devi  Raj Narain and Prem Sankar also had bronze medals in different events. “Now  Kiran Devi has a job in Assam Rifles. Two of our former rowers like Indian team member at the Doha Asian Games  Munshadi Khatun has been hired by the Haryana Sports Department  whereas Kudrat Ali was given the prestigious Laxman award by the UP Government in 2018. Few others like Rajesh Yadav and Dalbir Singh were given Yash Bharti and Arjuna awards  respectively.” Sharma  however  said that getting jobs in Uttar Pradesh has been a difficult preposition as for the last many years  the concerned authorities are struggling to formulate plan for this. “Look at the non-implementation of the policy of giving jobs in 2015 in which sportspersons with international achievements were supposed to be appointed on gazette posts so expecting anything in near future is very difficult. But if our rowers get proper training now they could be successful in getting jobs in central government’s organisation ” said a senior rower on condition of anonymity.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/eyeing-a-govt-job-rowers-struggle-in-the-absence-of-training/story-00zDb9KPXssTCrW25MLIqN.html

30/06/2020,technology;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;australia,Banned Chinese apps: A question of alternatives and home-grown tech,Of the 59 applications banned by the Indian government  many were popular among the youth. The move however has invited significant support as well as apprehension among youngsters,On Monday evening  the government went ahead and decided to ban 59 Chinese apps  something that has since become the talk of town. While some could see this coming  others were surprised with the move. Popular applications like TikTok  Shareit  Shein and WeChat  among others were the ones that have been banned. Nandikaa Sachdev  a Mumbai-based student is of the opinion that the reason given for banning the apps i.e — “engaging in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India  defence of India  security of state and public order ” is a matter of grave concern  and cannot be taken lightly. “I believe that the Chinese could be engaging in cyber activities which could be prejudicial and detrimental to our privacy. These apps violate the privacy policies and steal the data which is further misused ” she says.  A few weeks ago  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison  too  hinted that the Chinese were behind numerous cyber attacks that the country was facing.  The move to ban Chinese apps has found support across the country. However  it is the move to ban the widely popular app TikTok  that is raising eyebrows  for the simple reason that it was voguish. “I am a content creator myself ” says Indore-based professional Shraddha Jandial  adding  “I do believe that what has to go viral will find its ways  TikTok has been a platform that has taken User Generated Content to a whole new level. Anyone and everyone could be a star.” However  many youngsters have one question in mind. What about the people who work for these companies in India? What about their jobs? Vedika Palani  a Chennai-based student says  “I’ve seen numerous job postings by TikTok on Linkedin. I just hope the people who work for the company in India find new jobs  or are at least given assistance in looking for one.” Disha Arora  a Delhi-based professional  agrees  and adds  “It is true that apps like TikTok have changed many lives. But if it is invading privacy  then action has to be taken.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banned-chinese-apps-a-question-of-alternatives-and-home-grown-tech/story-UeEZtZZyJM79H7b82r2uBN.html

29/06/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;japan;malaysia;singapore;thailand,This “school of the future” stood strong during the pandemic,With its systematic planning  reliance on technology and implementation of revolutionary ideas  Global Indian International School (GIIS) is one such school that is constantly working ahead of time to deal with future challenges.,There are institutions that maintain set benchmarks and follow set patterns of leadership. And then there are those visionary institutions that create their own benchmarks through forward thinking  staying ahead of the curve with systematic planning and implementing revolutionary ideas  and find themselves well-prepared for future challenges. GIIS is one such institution. Headquartered in Singapore  Global Indian International School had prepared itself to be a future-ready school a good six years ago. It has been offering virtual classrooms  which is considered a norm today as lockdown has forced schools to find alternative ways of taking lessons to students  across its campuses around the globe for the last 2 years. Little wonder then that the network campuses of GIIS had provided over 3 million hours of virtual classrooms in about 2 months to over 15 000 students across 7 countries  while other institutions were scrambling to join the digital bandwagon. But then  being digital is not the only thing about GIIS that stands out. There is much more to it.  A Step in the Right Direction It all started sometime in 2014  when Global Schools Foundation conceptualised the idea of School of the Future with state-of-the-art digital classrooms and tech-savvy infrastructure to provide nextgen learning to students. The Singapore-headquartered institution  with a network of 21 campuses (7 in India: Noida  Pune  Bangalore  Ahmedabad & Surat)  spread across Singapore  India  Japan  Thailand  Malaysia  Vietnam and UAE  started implementing this. In 2018  GIIS commenced operations of its first SMART Campus in Singapore  which was soon followed by 3 more SMART Campuses in India in Pune and Bangalore  heralding the future of education. Equipped with smart interactive boards  wi-fi systems  audio-visual elements and ability to connect to experts and peers worldwide  the classrooms of GIIS were already providing virtual learning to its students.  This forward thinking idea held GIIS in good stead when the pandemic struck. As the world huddled into lockdowns in March 2020  all GIIS campuses switched to Virtual Schooling within a week. Well-versed with technology  teachers lost no time in moving to online classrooms; hold regular classes with their smart devices and Google Classrooms for collaborative work.  GIIS was among the first to provide complete education continuity to its students from the safety of their homes. To ensure the learning experience was seamless without any disruption  the school also launched a helpline number to help resolve all queries related to virtual classes in real time. Both parents and students were happy and found merit in the way GIIS teachers effectively conducted these virtual classes. Hear them out! Watch more here. NextGen Learning Digital Classrooms are at the heart of GIIS’ future-proof initiative. Benchmarked to be the best among K-12 schools across the world  they are equipped with video-conferencing  screen sharing  multimedia touchscreen smart boards  a healthy repository of digital content and high-speed wi-fi  apart from facial recognition systems  digital lockers and CCTV for enhanced safety. All classrooms of GIIS Smart Campuses in Hadapsar and Balewadi in Pune and Bannerghatta in Bangalore  have integrated future-focused initiatives within the core curriculum  enabling students and faculty to access cutting-edge methodologies from across the world.  Audio-visual rooms are fully functional with video conferencing facility  where students interact with their peers at other GIIS campuses in UAE  Tokyo  Malaysia  and Singapore. A unique initiative of GIIS - the Global Student Exchange (GSE) programme  enables students to exchange knowledge while working together on projects related to finding solutions to real world problems. Bringing the world to the classroom  these platforms also help in fostering 21st  century skills of problem solving  communication  critical thinking  creativity and collaboration. Virtual learning today  allows students to connect real-time from the comfort of their homes and access their classrooms. Smart interactive boards installed in the classrooms enable experiential learning  giving students and teachers the freedom to stream educational videos  besides displaying their classwork and projects. The faculty makes use of Google applications in their day-to-day instruction  including Google Classrooms  Docs  Sheets  and Slides. These facilitate the sharing of information  making class announcements and conducting class assessments.  These Smart campuses let students access iPads and other smart devices to augment the classroom experience. Educational apps provide practice activities  instruction-based knowledge and instant evaluation to support textbook modules  enabling involved attention and deeper understanding of the topics.  An infallible digital infrastructure built around the latest computer systems support students as well as faculty of SMART campuses in achieving their goals of learning. With one desktop per student  the IT and Math labs facilitate students to work on their individual projects. Teachers can organise records with greater efficiency while keeping abreast with best education practices from the world.  Smart Tech in Sports  Committed to preparing all-rounders  GIIS introduced SPEDAS or ‘Sports Performance Enhancing Data Analytics System’ at its campuses. Inaugurated by the Captain of Indian Football Team  Sunil Chhetri  this NBA- standard technology enables players to analytically improve their on-field performance. GIIS SMART Campus  Balewadi is one of the first schools in India to have integrated this smart technology in sports.  An Epitome of Excellence Established in 2002  the GSF network schools have achieved the unique feat of winning over 150 awards for education excellence and business excellence from international quality organisations. GIIS  one of the best international schools  today has students from over 50 countries  offering linguistic diversity and cultural exposure  giving a global experience.

29/06/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,No community spread of Covid-19 in Delhi: Amit Shah,The Union home minister  who has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the national capital  said Sisodia’s comments  created “fear” among people.,Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said there is  no community transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi  and added  that he was confident the Capital would not see 550 000 cases of the disease by July 31  as predicted by the state’s  deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia earlier this month. In an interview to ANI  the Union home minister  who has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the national capital  said Sisodia’s comments  created “fear” among people  and gave the Centre the cue to step in and coordinate the city’s response to the virus which has infected 83 077 people and killed 2 623 here till  Sunday. “Around the second week of June  Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that by July 31  there will be 5.50 lakh persons infected with the virus. He that there will be no place left  no beds left and the situation will be difficult. This created a lot of fear in the minds of people in Delhi. His estimate was based on figures. I do not want to go into whether estimate was right or wrong. But a situation of fear arose and some people started mulling an exodus (out of Delhi) ” Shah said. “The situation regarding bodies (of Covid-19 victims) in Delhi was grim. Over 350 bodies were pending for last rites. We decided that within two days last rites of bodies will be done as per religion. Today  no body is left for last rites. Now last rituals are conducted same day ” Shah said. The Centre  stepped in to manage the virus situation in Delhi on June 14  with Shah holding at least four meetings with central and state agencies so far  and visiting hospitals to assess their preparedness.  “…After Manish ji’s remarks  I felt that the central government should not stay idle. Modi ji has accountability towards the country. The PM also told me that the home ministry should take initiative to move forward and help the Delhi government ” he said. The home minister stressed that there is coordination between the Centre and state in tackling Covid-19 in Delhi. “There is coordination...(Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal is always kept in the loop. Decisions are taken by involving him also ” he said. Reacting to the home minister’s interview  Sisodia in a statement on Sunday said  “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help and support of every agency to battle (the)  corona (virus disease)  in Delhi. We got tremendous support from the central government  religious organisations like Radha Soami Satsang  Akshardham Temple Trust  Terapanthi  various hotels  banquets halls  private hospitals and NGOs like Doctors for U  and others.”  He added: “ For increasing testing  we sought central government’s assistance  and they helped us with procuring rapid testing kits.

In an interview to ANI  the Union home minister  who has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the national capital  said Sisodia’s comments  created “fear” among people  and gave the Centre the cue to step in and coordinate the city’s response to the virus which has infected 83 077 people and killed 2 623 here till  Sunday. “Around the second week of June  Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that by July 31  there will be 5.50 lakh persons infected with the virus. He that there will be no place left  no beds left and the situation will be difficult. This created a lot of fear in the minds of people in Delhi. His estimate was based on figures. I do not want to go into whether estimate was right or wrong. But a situation of fear arose and some people started mulling an exodus (out of Delhi) ” Shah said. “The situation regarding bodies (of Covid-19 victims) in Delhi was grim. Over 350 bodies were pending for last rites. We decided that within two days last rites of bodies will be done as per religion. Today  no body is left for last rites. Now last rituals are conducted same day ” Shah said. The Centre  stepped in to manage the virus situation in Delhi on June 14  with Shah holding at least four meetings with central and state agencies so far  and visiting hospitals to assess their preparedness.  “…After Manish ji’s remarks  I felt that the central government should not stay idle. Modi ji has accountability towards the country. The PM also told me that the home ministry should take initiative to move forward and help the Delhi government ” he said. The home minister stressed that there is coordination between the Centre and state in tackling Covid-19 in Delhi. “There is coordination...(Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal is always kept in the loop. Decisions are taken by involving him also ” he said. Reacting to the home minister’s interview  Sisodia in a statement on Sunday said  “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help and support of every agency to battle (the)  corona (virus disease)  in Delhi. We got tremendous support from the central government  religious organisations like Radha Soami Satsang  Akshardham Temple Trust  Terapanthi  various hotels  banquets halls  private hospitals and NGOs like Doctors for U  and others.”  He added: “ For increasing testing  we sought central government’s assistance  and they helped us with procuring rapid testing kits. Since then  testing has been increased by four times. The Centre  also provided us with oxygen cylinders  ITBP [Indo-Tibetan Border Police] doctors and nurses for Radha Soami Covid centre and guidance from domain experts. “ The deputy CM himself hoped that the estimate of 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July would prove wrong and pointed out that the recovery rate in Delhi is now 62%.  “We are hopeful that situation will improve in the coming weeks and will certainly not be as bleak as it looked in first week of June when domain experts predicted 5.5 lakh cases in Delhi by July 31.”  Shah said a series of steps have been taken to stem the spread of the virus and ramp up medical facilities. “…I can say now with confidence that situation of 5.5 lakh cases will not come on July 31 ” Shah said.

Various agencies had mounted a rescue operation to remove over 2 300 people from the Markaz after several who had allegedly attended a religious congregation there returned to their respective home states and were tested positive for the virus. Seven deaths  six of which were in Telangana alone  were also reported.  The deaths prompted the authorities to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus and file a criminal case against the Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and six other office bearers  for defying a series of government directives  which curbed religious and large gatherings  issued to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital. Charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy were added to the case after the deaths of some of the attendees. No arrests have been made in the case  so far. Advocate Fuzail Ayubi  counsel for the Markaz  said that the assumption of the investigating agency to charge his clients for 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) is completely “Misplaced” “The section 304 could not have been applied here in these circumstances and the assumption of the investigating agency is completely misplaced ” he said.  According to the charge sheet filed in the case in the Saket court  the city police have said that during investigation it was found that six persons who were part of the religious congregation at the Markaz had lost their lives at the Lok Nayak hospital  a quarantine centre in Sultanpuri and AIIMS  Jhajjar. “As per the certificates issued by the concerned doctors  their deaths had occurred due to corona virus infection ” the charge sheet read. While Yousuf Sahibu (36) from Tamil Nadu died on March 31 at AIIMS  Jhajjar  and Modokulov Maksat (38)  from Kyrgyzstan died at the same hospital on April 13. Two persons from Tamil Nadu—Majeeth Mustafa (68) and Thathkir Pichaikani (64) died at the Lok Nayak Hospital in Central Delhi  on April 9 and March 29 respectively. Another Tamil Nadu resident Mohammad Mustafa 60  had also died during treatment at the quarantine centre in Sultanpuri on April 22  the charge sheet says. The casualties also include a Delhi resident  Mohammad Aslam Abbasi (74) who died at the Lok Nayak hospital on March 31. The police have filed charge sheets against more than 900 foreigners and charged them for allegedly attending the religious congregation organised in March by the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters  in violation of their visa conditions and the Indian government’s guidelines on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. In the charge sheet filed  the police said that the foreigners accepted that they had attended the religious congregation for the purpose of professing and propagating the principles and doctrines of the Tablighi Jamaat and had remained at its headquarters (Markaz) for some period. “In order to ascertain their visit to Banglewali Masjid  Hazrat Nizamuddin  Delhi the register maintained at the Banglewali Masjid was taken into police possession  which further confirms their visit  including their name  country  passport number  period of stay and date of expiry of visa ” the police said. The police also added that in order to substantiate the legitimacy of their visit to India  passports of 723 foreigners and Identity Cards of 23 Nepal nationals have been taken into possession through seizure/handing over memos. “Some of the accused foreign nationals were unable to provide / produce their passports.

Women thus  are finding it hard to purchase sanitary pads and maintain menstrual hygiene. But thanks to a workshop that some of them had attended  they were able to make pads at home. “In this time of crisis  everyone is making pads at home. This gets us some money  and the need for pads is also fulfilled ” says Divya who lives in Kusumpur Pahari  a slum area in Delhi. And Pushpa Bhau Khokane from Belaj in Maharashtra feels empowered  too. She says  “There isn’t any shop to buy pads here. When we produce them  we help other women and also earn something.” The WASH project by NGO Humans for Humanity conducts workshops to help women deal with period related problems. Anurag  founder of the project  says  “We also provide workshops on making pads at home. Our volunteers  along with research scholars and gynaecologists  discuss personal hygiene  ways to use and dispose the napkins and other issues with women.” While many women have become self-reliant  others are provided sanitary pads. Maya Vishwakarma  also known as the Pad Woman of India  has been working to break the stigma around menstruation in the rural areas of Madhya Pradesh. “I was providing pads to the tribal women in the Narsinghpur district. Then  we distributed 1 000-1 500 grocery kits that  included sanitary pads  among migrant women  too ” she says.

The date of the resumption of sports activities are yet to be announced  first to kick off the training would be the A category disciplines like archery  athletics  badminton  gymnastics  squash  table tennis  tennis  weightlifting  powerlifting  fencing  shooting  soft tennis  cycling  rowing  kayaking and canoeing  whereas the disciplines in the B category include basketball  cricket  football  handball  hockey  volleyball and netball.  The C category has disciplines mostly the contact sports like swimming  boxing  judo  kho-kho  kabaddi  wrestling  taekwondo  wushu and karate. “We have fianlised the disciplines to start with but the coaching would begin in phased manner. We aren’t going to compromise with the heath of the sportspersons at the time when the pandemic corona virus has made things difficult for everyone ” UP’s director sports  RP Singh said on Wednesday. “We have yet not finalized the resumption day of the sporting activities across the state  but start of the training/coaching would help the ad hoc coaches in those particular disciplines get into action ” he said  adding  “All the centres have been told to strictly follow the norms of thermo scanning  social distancing  hand sanitization and also the sanitization of instruments for the use in the disciplines.” It is learnt that much before finalizing the list of disciplines UP Sports Directorate discussed the issue with the health departments and even sought the opinion of all its offices across the state.  “Only after seeing the success result of resumption of category A sports  we will start the coaching/training of B category sports  but the resumption of C category sports would come at the last. All the contact sports are in C category and we will take a final call on these disciplines only when things returned to full normalcy.” Singh  however  said that to monitor the entry and exit of the trainees/sportspersons  registration of all is a must. “No one would be allowed to get trained at the stadium without having registration as keeping everyone’s record is a must in this situation.” It is learnt that 400 plus ad hoc coaches across the state are eagerly waiting for the resumption of sports activities since march 25  which was the last day of their stint last season. Technically  their 11-month tenure contract had to be resumed from April 1  but the lockdown brought everything to standstill and since they have been struggling for remuneration  thus facing the worst financial crisis of their lives. “It’s good that training/coaching are due to be resumed soon though in phased manner.

However  there are  still many who feel it could have been delayed as people are seen flouting safety norms  some even venturing out without masks. Soni Razdan  too  feels Unlock 1.0 isn’t for all and  says we have “dealt with enough to be responsible and smart”.   Cooking classes in progress ... umm just don’t imagine we did any actual cooking 😂 A few stirrings here and there. And they want to put it on tik tok 🙈. Have strictly forbidden it 😂😛🥴 A post shared by  Soni Razdan (@sonirazdan) on Apr 24  2020 at 9:59pm PDT “Whatever footage I’m seeing on TV  where people can be seen doing otherwise  touching things unnecessarily  kids moving out without masks  etc is horrifying. If we don’t understand what’s good for ourselves  then no one else can ” says the actor known for her Bollywood projects Saaransh (1984)  Sadak (1991) and Raazi (2018). Talking about people rushing out the moment relaxations were imposed  Razdan  63  highlights the psychological side of it. “After so many days of restrictions  what do you expect people to do? I feel social distancing isn’t in the DNA of our nation… If you know that you might forget  please try and wear gloves at least in one hand so that even if you touch anything the chances of the virus infecting you is less ” she adds. While she also steps out rarely to get essentials  Razdan shares that given her age and also that of her husband  filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt  she’s very careful.  I didn’t give you the gift of life ... Life gave me the gift of you ♥️. #daughtersday #thesetwo #darlingdaughters A post shared by  Soni Razdan (@sonirazdan) on Sep 22  2019 at 6:29am PDT “I used to go to walk on the beach  sometimes within the premises of my society because they were empty but then I stop whenever there’s a crowd. When I go out to buy certain things  I’m extra cautious and finish my work quickly. I know my husband is home. He’s older to me and hasn’t stepped out at all. His safety is in my hands. I think aged people who’re carelessly moving around should stop. Let the youth  who are stronger  have better immunity  go out if required ” she says. Daughters Alia and Shaheen  who live in the same society  also visit them. But “there are proper gaps” in between these meetings as they  too  go out at times  hence can’t risk meeting their parents often. On how she is holding up  Razdan shares  “I don’t really make an effort or look for some amusement. We keep ourselves busy and relaxed. I’ve being writing a film. We’ve divided our work. He waters the plants  I do cooking… The best thing is I’ve gone back to yoga and I’ve been teaching my husband the same for last two months. So we practise together. This lockdown taught me so much humility. We aren’t invincible. Anything can come and destroy us. We shouldn’t take things for granted.” While the industry is preparing to go back to work  Razdan plans to take time before she does. “The film I was working on is almost done  I was going to start a short film but I don’t think I’ll be rushing back till I feel safe and sure… I think the industry will also take its own course ” she ends.

20/06/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Corona battle: IVRI in the forefront  testing both human and animal samples,,Lucknow: A week before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced lockdown across the country to fight Covid-19 outbreak  a meeting was hastily called at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) Bareilly to discuss testing  the most essential element in the fight against corona virus. “The meeting was called after we got the go ahead from director-general Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) Trilochan Mohapatra to begin Covid-19 testing in our lab ” recalled RK Singh  director general  IVRI. The meeting ended briefly with directions to experts who were tasked to begin preparations for testing. Now three months later  the entire health infrastructure of Covid-19 management in districts of Rohilkhand region depends on tests done at IVRI. The deemed institute for veterinary sciences is one of the 33 designated testing centres in the state and the only place where Covid-19 samples of both animals and humans are tested. It is the only Covid-19 testing facility for Bareilly  Badaun  Pilibhit and other adjoining districts of the region. After making arrangements for sample handling  testing protocols and training the required staff  IVRI began testing on April 16. Only five samples were tested on the first day. At that time  the number of cases across the country was in double digit. “We have successfully tested 10761 samples of various district of the region till now. We are trying to test close to 300 samples every day. We have also tested 43 Covid-19 samples from wild animals ” said VK Gupta  joint director of Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD) at IVRI which is handling Covid-19 testing.  Covid-19 is found to infect some species of wild animals who can act as its carrier. So the Institute is also testing samples of animals sent from various parts of the country. The Covid-19 testing for animals began on April 6 and so far 43 samples collected from tigers  leopards   lions  black bears  bats  monkeys  elephants  wild boars and bisons from Uttar Pradesh  Uttarakhand  Jharkhand  Rajasthan and Delhi have been tested. All these samples were found negative except that of a tiger and lion sent from Jaipur zoo. The results of both these samples are awaited. The testing of samples of both animals and humans is part of the push for the idea of ‘one health’ which believes that human and animal health is closely interlinked. The idea has been an integral part of IVRI since its inception.  In 1889 when the Institute was established to look for cure of animal diseases  Dr Alfred Lingard  a physician  was made its first director.  “Covid-19 pandemic has proved again that we need to work in the direction of one health ” said Singh.  The institute has also begun research to develop a Covid-19 vaccine for animals and hopes that it may pave the way for human vaccines.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-battle-ivri-in-the-forefront-testing-both-human-and-animal-samples/story-ou4IYD6vXm4fpvNugigaaO.html

These will include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna  Gram Sadak Yojna  Jal Jeevan Yojna  PM Gram Sadak Yojna  etc ” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a press conference on Thursday. The move will not involve new budgetary allocation -- the 25 schemes will be front-loaded  utilising in 125 days the allocation meant for the year  said Sitharaman. Aimed to boosting livelihood opportunities in rural India  the programme will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities ” an official communique said.

The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan will start from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district. The programme will cover India’s 116 districts across Bihar  Uttar Pradesh  Madhya Pradesh  Rajasthan  Jharkhand and Odisha. All these districts have received more than 25 000 migrant workers during the lockdown. “We are pooling resources from these 25 projects. There are some works which may get affected by monsoon such as laying of roads. But we want to front load the money allotted for these for those 116 districts and ensure that all those workers in these districts are given employment ” said Sitharaman. Rural development secretary NN Sinha said that the laying of fibre optics cable  railway works  rurban mission jobs  sanitation works  waste management  poultry  farm ponds and training through Krishi Vogyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme. He added that there is no bar for other districts to join the programme if they also have more than 25 000 migrant workers. The 116 districts will also contain 27 Aspirational Districts—India’s poorest areas in socio-economic indices—and the government hopes to cover about two-third of migrant workers  the government communique said.  Twelve different ministries or departments-- rural development  panchayati raj  transport  mines  drinking water  environment  railways  petroleum  new & renewable energy  border Roads  telecom and agriculture — will participate in the programme  the release added.  “Money has been pooled in together to start the programme. The priority is to provide immediate work for them as we go along; we have to see how it goes and if some people would like to stay or go back ” Sitharaman said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-000-cr-public-works-on-the-cards-for-generating-jobs/story-BAmzE0l9VJMQmU8oRNTw7K.html

Singh says quite a few other autograph collectors will follow suit. Well  it seems  along with everything that is changing in the life and times of Covid-19  fandom too is up for a revamp. And  contactless fandom might become the ‘new normal’.  Talking more about their decision  Singh adds  “We used to travel throughout the country to collect autographs. But we won’t this year.

Rishabh Gupta of Akshay Kumar fan club  Team Akshay on Twitter  shares  they would be “requesting fans via social media to maintain social distancing”. Gupta says the moment Bollywood actors start shooting  “fans would forget everything” when they would see their favourite star and might go near them. “The idea is to not go near Akshay sir or other actors. We’ll be requesting members to maintain physical distancing ” he adds.  Raj Sharma of Salman Khan’s fan club  Planet Salman on twitter  echoes the thought. “We love Salman Khan and don’t want to create problems for him. We would request our members to not crowd around him. If he agrees to click a selfie from a distance then only go for it ” he adds. The fan clubs also mentioned about being sad that there won’t be any hugs  handshakes or meeting their favourite stars at film festivals too. However  they aren’t complaining  as this time  according to Gupta  too shall pass and those good days of having that personal touch with their favourite stars would soon be back. Mehak Malhotra  a Sidhharth Malhotra fan  says if at all she meets him during this period  she would request someone else to click a photo. “Would request Siddharth sir to pose from a distance  we can explore camera angles to give an impression that we aren’t standing apart.” Actor Sonu Sood  who has been stepping out daily for his humanitarian work  shares fans do understand. “People sometimes come requesting for a selfie but when I tell them this isn’t the right time they understand. There have been times when I’ve taken selfies but from a distance and only if s/he was wearing a mask. I would miss having my fans around but now we all have to operate differently ” he adds. Much like fans  bodyguards and managers of these actors are also wary. Shree Tele  Akshay Kumar’s bodyguard  shares he would be extra cautious. “I’ll also maintain distance from him. No one would be allowed to come near him unless he approves ” he says.

17/06/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Mohit Sehgal makes shocking revelations: A  producer tried to buy me by offering a new show,Actor Mohit Sehgal talks about going through the struggle of not being paid his remuneration on time  especially during the lockdown period.,Several actors in the past have spoken against the 90-day payment system in the TV industry and how it has affected them. And of late  amid Covid-19 crisis  a lot of actors had to knock the doors of the Cine & TV Artists Association (CINTAA) and even appeal on social media to get their dues. Reading about their situation reminded actor Mohit Sehgal of his days  when he faced a similar struggle.  “I know how those actors must be feeling. I went through similar problems for three of my shows. When I was working for Khamoshiyan  I had to wait for nine months to get my dues. We shot the pilot for six months with no pay and after the show went on air  the makers told me  ‘We’ll pay you after three months’. Nobody was saying anything  but I told them that I needed my money to pay my rent  to eat and for daily expenses ” Sehgal recounts. The actor  however  put a condition that  ‘If you give me in writing that I’ll get paid  I’ll resume shooting’  but they weren’t ready to do that as well. I found it fishy and thought I might not get paid like that and decided to put my foot down ” he says.   Keep calm and carry on   Enjoy the little little things all day long .🌼 A post shared by  Mohit Sehgal (@itsmohitsehgal) on May 23  2020 at 7:12am PDT Sehgal also talks about escalating the matter to CINTAA  and how he further had to face frightening experiences. “There were 50-60 people screaming at each other. My hands and legs were shivering. The producers declared themself bankrupt. One of the producers came to me and said  ‘You leave this show’s money  forget about it and we will give you a new one’. I said  ‘Did you just say that?’ They were trying to buy me  and what was the guarantee that they wouldn’t do the same thing again? ” he says. After much bargaining  Sehgal says he could only got 50% of what was due and promised to him  but because of all this  the industry started to form perceptions about him. “The channel and people from the industry started to misunderstand me. I knew in my heart that I’m doing what was right for me. In future  I just hope to work with a good team  good producers and be a part of a good show where everybody works joyfully and with no stress of payments ” ends Sehgal on a hopeful note.

I’ve also been taking homemade kadhas and taking rest. Till Friday (June 12) I wasn’t being able to talk  but now I feel better. But my doctor said the fever might relapse. If it does I’ll have to get the test done ” she adds. Questioning the Delhi government’s claim that there are enough test kits    available  she wrote in open letter: “…I thought some reports were rumours but now I am forced to believe. If getting a test done to know if a person is positive or negative is such an issue  I really don’t know how the government will help the people of Delhi…”  This one was taken when Prerna & me  came disappointedly unaccomplished in our honest plan to con the Basus!!

The actor says “having a critical view on certain things” isn’t wrong  but then “abusing and threatening” using foul language is unacceptable.

One needs to handle social media responsibly. If you can’t say anything nice  there is an option of not saying anything at all. But some people don’t understand. So it’s better to ignore trolls  they strive on our attention ” she adds.

My father has started going to work. I know he has a staff working under him  who he needs to supported. But I’m worried about his health… So whenever this happens I speak with my parents. We all should in fact talk to our loved ones during such phases ” she adds. To feel better she does a lot of meditation  doing an acting course and also been catching up with friends. That brings us to the question whether she’s in touch with good friend  cricketer KL Rahul. There were speculations of them dating. While Rahul stayed mum  Agerwal had negated it. “I don’t want to talk about it. I had genuinely answered these [rumours] before. There’s no point in talking about it again ” she says.  Ask if she’s aware of rumours that Rahul and actor Athiya Shetty are more than good friends? And Agerwal adds  “I don’t know  I’ve nothing to say on this.

But life will always throw challenges at us  how we get over them  defines us  feels Waheeda Rehman. The veteran actor says the Covid-19 crisis demands us “to be careful  sensible and intelligent”. And for none of these “one needs bookish knowledge”and just need to learn from life experiences. “If you see  along with good times  we all deal with some crisis or the other all our lives. I’m not trying to draw a comparison. I feel it’s very important for us to be patient. If you get paranoid  it’ll only stress you out and you might end up making mistakes ” says the Padma Bhusan awardee.

Whether we’re at home or have to step out  we need to find a way. I see many flouting safety norms  not wearing masks properly since the lockdown has been eased. That’s absolutely wrong ” she rues. With no intention of sounding philosophical  the actor  82  says we know nothing about our future. “But we all know that we’ll have to die one day. Par darr darr ke nahi jee sakte. We must face difficulties headstrong and stay positive ” says Rehman  who’s spending time in lockdown watching films  doing yoga  taking a walk in the garden and enjoying her photography sessions. Not much fond of mobile phones  Rehman  however  is feeling its necessity now  as it helps her stay connected with relatives and friends. “I talk to my sister  nephews and nieces a lot these days. Asha (Parekh; actor) aur Helen (actor) se bhi baat hoti rehti hai ” she says. The actor’s family is also ensuring that they take care of their staff members well. “We can’t stop anyone’s salary. If we have food to eat then people who work for us should also have food on their table ” she says adding that “the priority right now is to be responsible towards ourselves  only then we can help others”. Expressing concern around people facing mental health issues these days  she urges  “Agar aap yahi sochoge ki  ‘ab toh kuch nahi ho sakta  main mar jaunga’  toh usse kya hoga?

And so  Kamya Panjabi Dang recently returned to Mumbai from Gurugram  as shooting of her TV show Shakti — Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki  is expected to start this month. She also posted a picture with her daughter Aara (9) in wearing PPE and captioned it  “work calling”. Kamya tells us  “Though we knew that Aara (her nine-year-old daughter) and I would have to return to Mumbai the moment work resumes  my family  especially my husband (Shalabh Dang) was worried. Thankfully  we’ve reached home safely.”  Work Calling.... ✈️ A post shared by  Kamya Shalabh Dang (@panjabikamya) on Jun 8  2020 at 10:57pm PDT Impressed with the preventive measures being taken by authorities  the actor shares that both the airports (Delhi and Mumbai) provided them with the required facilities. “When I came to Delhi  these airports weren’t checking properly and passengers were roaming around without mask and not practising social distancing. But  this time  since there are lesser flights  there were fewer people  our temperatures were checked  everything was getting sanitised at intervals ” she shares. However  Kamya 40  sounds upset talking about some passengers misbehaving with the authorities at the airport.  “Why blame the government for everything? I saw many rushing to take their seats in the flight and when it landed  while we were told two rows will be emptied at a time  many started jostling. I’ve also been noticing how people are taking advantage of relaxations and roaming around without masks. If they fall sick  who’s to be blamed?” she asks.

I really don’t understand. People who can afford to stay at home  they can and write on social media about it. But  there are many who must go back to work to earn a living. We must go back to work for them. It’s the middle class that suffers. They can’t beg and can’t survive without work.” Talking about how she would ensure all possible precautions at work  Kamya has a plan in mind  already. “I’ll do my own makeup. Get my costumes home a day before  wash and iron. Since I have a separate room  all my belongings will be kept there. I’ll carry all my stuff from home. I’m ready to shoot for 12 hours like usual if things are in place ” she shares  adding why she needs to be extra cautious “because of my mother and daughter at home.”  Follow @htshowbiz for more,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/kamya-panjabi-dang-on-going-back-to-work-we-must-start-working-for-those-who-needs-to-earn-a-living-to-survive/story-A6nnMrQuqUyI45wL8qXqJK.html

But due to the Covid-19 crisis and other reasons  neither has the little one been able to meet her grandparents  nor has she been able to go out and play.  Love how Happiness is not defined by anything else but "Togetherness" ❤️ #randomfun #gibberish A post shared by  Neil Nitin Mukesh (@neilnitinmukesh) on Jun 13  2020 at 10:16pm PDT “They were travelling for my father’s concert for quite some time and when they had just come back  this (lockdown) happened. My office is in Andheri where Rukmini (wife)  Nurvi and I stay  and on Fridays we usually go to our other house where my parents and Naman (brother) stay. But we aren’t doing that now. My worry is about relations  so I make sure we make Nurvi speak with her paternal and maternal grandparents and my sister Neha via video calls at least thrice a day ” he shares. Other than that  Neil’s efforts are driven towards keeping daughter Nurvi engaged. “Since we live on the ground floor  the park in our society is clearly visible from our house. One of these days  I saw her looking at the park quietly ” he recalls  deliberating upon how other children too must be feeling sad and restless about being cooped up in their homes.

She follows her routine. Kids adapt to things so quickly.

Ask him about what’s keeping him busy work-wise  he says  “I’m working on my future scripts  and writing too.” Being a creative soul  Neil can’t simply binge watch content.

16/06/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,Covid-19 fuelling mother and child mortality rates,,Priyanshi Kol was born in her parent’s one-room hutment in Ansara village in the Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh on May 21 because her mother Shivjanki  26  couldn’t get an ambulance to reach Sanjay Gandhi Medical Hospital 100 km away. She died on June 13 from childbirth-related complications. She was 23 days old. Priyanshi was a so-called low-birth baby  weighing 2 kg at birth against the healthy birth weight of 2.5 kg or more. “When the ambulance didn’t arrive  women got together and delivered the baby at home. Within days  the umbilical cord started bleeding and we called for an ambulance  which didn’t come. We spent Rs 4 000 to take her to the district hospital on May 27  but brought her home because the doctors were busy with (the) corona(virus disease)  and didn’t have time for us ” said her father Mithilesh Kor  who is a daily-wage worker. His baby girl developed fever again and when the ambulance didn’t reach them for the third time in three weeks  the Kors took her to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital again  where she died. “My son Piyush was born in a hospital  and he is safe. She would have lived if she had got treated ” said an inconsolable Shivjanki. “Institutional deliveries have fallen from around 75% to less than 25% in the districts we work in. Since Integrated Child Development Services were suspended on March 15  nutrition and immunisation services have take a huge hit and community health workers stopped visiting homes to immunise children because they are doing coronavirus-related work. District -level surveys show 50% children and 75% pregnant women being deprived of essential nutrition in the state ” said Sachin Jain  state coordinator of the Bhopal-based non-profit  Vikas Sansad Samiti  which works on issues related to hunger and maternal and child health in the state’s most underserved and largely tribal districts  such as Rewa  Shivpuri  Rewari  Panna  and Shivpuri.  Around 80.8% births in Madhya Pradesh took place in hospitals in 2015-16  according to the National Family Health Survey-4  compared to the national average of 78.9%. State-level data on institutional births since March is not available. Falling immunisation As public and private health systems across India geared up to respond to coronavirus disease (Covid-19)  they inadvertently did so at the expense of other critical public health services. This threatens to lead to a parallel explosion in illness and deaths from other preventable and treatable diseases  which will raise all-cause deaths across ages  say experts. Adding to the crisis is missing data. With states busy fire-fighting Covid-19  routine disease surveillance has been hit  creating huge gaps in data on outbreaks. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)  which is tasked with tracking outbreaks ranging from seasonal influenza H1N1 to child-killers like diarrhoea  chicken pox and measles  is busy tracking Covid-19 and hasn’t updated its live weekly outbreak dashboard since the end of February. The National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme  which tracks malaria  chikungunya and dengue  among others  hasn’t received state reports since March. Routine immunisation is floundering  but it’s difficult to assess the damage in the absence of data. “States haven’t sent immunisation data since the lockdown  but anecdotal evidence indicates there’s been a sharp drop. We have asked states that suspended services to organise catch-up vaccinations drives as soon as possible  with districts with high infant and child mortality  where communities are completely dependent on government services ” said Dr Pradeep Haldar  deputy commissioner  immunisation division  ministry of health and family welfare. One in five of the world’s 5.9 million under-5 deaths take place in India  with more than half being from vaccine-preventable and treatable infections  such as pneumonia  diarrhoea and sepsis. If all children are vaccinated after birth  more than half these lives could be saved. But children like Priyanshi who are born at home also miss three vaccines given at birth -- BCG against childhood tuberculosis  oral polio vaccine  and the first doses of hepatitis B vaccine that protects against liver infection and cirrhosis. Many others  like her two-year-old brother Piyush  who  got immunised at birth have missed booster vaccines since March  which could lead to a resurgence of potentially fatal diseases  such as childhood pneumonia  diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis (whooping cough)  hepatitis B and diarrhoea. This threatens to reverse the gains India has made by immunising children against vaccine-preventing illnesses to bring down its infant mortality rate (IMR) to 32 per 1 000 live births in 2018  from 129 in 1971  according to the Sample Registration System (SRS) data released in June 2019. “During the monsoons  there is a rise in malaria and vaccine-preventable diarrhoea  pneumonia and measles  which are the biggest cause of under-5 deaths in India. If childhood vaccines are missed  IMR  malnutrition and stunting will rise and prevent India from meeting its Sustainable Development Goal of bringing IMR down to 25 or less by 2030 ” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar  director  Public Health foundation of India Gandhinagar  Gujarat. Unsafe births  unsafe abortions Covid-19 has also reduced access to contraception and abortion services  which is likely to lead to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. “The first four months of Covid-19  we estimate that access to 1.85 million abortions was compromised. This is around 47% of the estimated 3.9 million abortions that would have taken place in this period under normal circumstances ” said Vinoj Manning  chief executive officer  Ipas Development Foundation  a non-profit that promotes safe abortion services in India. Of the estimated 15.6 million annual abortions in India  73% are through medical abortion pills that can be bought in pharmacies  16% are in private health facilities  6% in public health centres  and 5% through traditional unsafe methods  according to the first large-scale study on unintended pregnancies published in The Lancet in 2017. “Since medical abortions must be done within 12 weeks of pregnancy (first trimester)  the restricted movement and services would have resulted in many pregnant women moving to the second trimester during the lockdown. Very few clinics and hospitals offers abortion services beyond 12 weeks  and the fear of Covid-19 is keeping women away from the ones that do. Add to that the out-of-pocket cost of visiting a hospital at a time of job loss and reduced income  and we find many women being forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy or seeking illegal and unsafe abortion services ” said Manning. An estimated 48% of all pregnancies are unintended because women don’t have  information about safe sex or don’t have access to contraceptives  according to study published The Lancet study. Abortion is legal in India  but three unsafe abortions are performed for every two safe ones because 70% abortion clinics are in urban India  while 70% women live in rural areas  the study found.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-fuelling-mother-and-child-mortality-rates/story-NvmX3Cn7KMqlff77R9BoZN.html

13/06/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,4 persons who assaulted cops get bail  asked to deposit ₹5000 in CM’s Relief Fund,,The Bombay high court on Friday granted bail to four persons who were part of a mob which attacked police patrol unit in Govandi during the lockdown on the condition that they deposit a fine of ₹5000 ‘as punishment to be responsible citizens’ in the chief minister’s relief fund. The fine amount is over and above the personal bond of ₹10000 that each of the accused has to furnish for the bail. The single-judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the bail applications of Gaus Mohammed Shaikh and three others were informed by advocates Jigar Agarwal and Shaikh Shafi Ahmed that there was no evidence against the four and they were arrested and booked only because they were in 22-25 years age group and were residents of the locality where the incident happened. The incident according to the prosecution occurred on April 26 when a police patrol was enforcing the lockdown in Govandi by shooing away hawkers squatting on the footpath. A mob of 25-30 persons brutally attacked the patrol team by throwing bricks and pelting them and their vehicles with stones. The prosecution submitted that the mob resorted to vandalism intending to impair police personnel from discharging their duty. Advocate HJ Dedhia appearing for the police submitted that the attack destroyed one of the police vans. “Entire conduct of the mob was shameful and they attempted to assault the police personnel engaged in official duty and who are rather putting their life at risk in the situation of Covid-19 pandemic to keep citizens safe and free of Covid-19 ” said Dedhia. After the situation was brought under control the Shivaji Nagar police arrested the four and charged them with an attempt to murder and for damaging public property and for disobeying orders by Police under Maharashtra Police Act. Dedhia also informed the court that two of the applicants had tested positive for Covid-19 and tested negative after appropriate medical treatment. After hearing submissions  Justice Dangre observed  “No doubt  the incident is unfortunate in the present scenario and the fact that several such incidences and occurrences are being reported in the entire country cannot be lost sight of.” The Court further said  “Though the applicants are entitled to the benefit of the doubt  alleged act policemen being attacked apparently while trying to enforce the corona virus-induced lock-down need to be tackled on a serious note. The applicants should be made to bear the consequences of assaulting the police team and causing an interruption in the discharge of their official duty.” While granting bail to the applicants on furnishing a personal bond of ₹10  000 with sureties  justice Dangre said that the applicants could be released on bail if they deposited ₹5000 each to the CM fund on their immediate release adding that  “Failure to do so would result in recalling of the said order releasing them on bail.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-persons-who-assaulted-cops-get-bail-asked-to-deposit-5000-in-cm-s-relief-fund/story-dcKdAk07NivRpKtodZdkSM.html

The Commission said that “as Covid-19 cases continue to rise” and the “government offers little clarity” on insurance cover for private healthcare professionals doing non-Covid work  and there is a scramble to find the right policy. “……while most doctors have a medical cover  the struggle has mainly been about ensuring protection for their staffers. Moreover  as mentioned (in a news report) there is also confusion whether the Rs 50 lakh health cover provided by the Central government for healthcare workers included private doctors  staffers and also those doing non-Covid work.” NHRC asked IRDA and Secretary  Department of Financial Services (DFS) in finance ministry to submit a detailed report within four weeks in the matter. It observed – “…in this period of pandemic  what the country needs most is proper health facilities and infrastructure. Denial of insurance claims by the companies to the Covid warriors will definitely bring down their morale and its result will adversely affect the general public at the end. Considering the issue as a case of violation of human rights   the Commission thought its intervention necessary in the matter as the sufferers will be poor citizens who are already under trauma of the Corona virus due to lack of medical facilities.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/nhrc-issues-notices-to-irda-and-finance-ministry-over-insurance-to-health-workers/story-yNZiMzuTbwypf1Rd9Y2SiK.html
12/06/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,afghanistan;israel;oman,Essay: On the need for a people’s history of the pandemic,It is imperative to have an oral historical narrative of Covid-19  the first global pandemic being documented on social media  writes Sankar Ray,Every datum is essential in an untold narrative and every piece of information is a guide to the unknown  which is like an algebraic infinity. There is no room for disagreement with Syria-born Swiss physician Tammam Aloudat  who believes we need a People’s History of the Corona virus. For this  he has created a Facebook group under the same name with over 1 000 members. Aloudat’s advantage is his activism as an insider of Doctors Without Borders and the International Red Cross/Red Crescent. He is used to working among people living in emerging nations confronting tough challenges. In an interview to Dan Drollette Jr  deputy editor  Bulletin of The Atomic Scientists  he said: “People’s History of the Coronavirus may not be completely typical of everyone’s experience of the pandemic  worldwide. By its very nature  this group is composed of people who are tied in to the digital world. And while there’s no doubt that this is a very diverse group  there is also no doubt that it is heavily skewed toward richer countries — people who have computers or smart phones and a reliable internet connection  and who can afford it all  for example. And most of the people on this group can afford shelter  and can afford to live in isolation for a time as well. So it’s definitely skewed in that direction.” The need for an oral historical narrative is pressing in as much as Covid-19 is the first global pandemic being extensively documented on social media  where both precious information and misinformation are being collated. Social media researcher Raymond Serrato spotted at least 208 public groups on Covid-19 with a combined following of 6.5 million. Or even more. The group’s posts range from the political to the deeply personal. Kelly Grote (53) of Massachusetts asks for “ideas on how to mobilize an effective protest while on lockdown” and for artworks  songs  and cartoons as well as offers for online chats to stave off the loneliness that comes with isolation. Others have shared “their fears  anxieties  sorrows  and moments of joy.” In an interview to the UNESCO Courier on 25 May  the International Day for Biological Diversity  Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari  author of Sapiens  Homo Deus  and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century  spoke about turning the crisis into an opportunity. “For the duration of the crisis  some social distancing is inevitable. The virus spreads by exploiting our best human instincts. We are social animals. We like contact  especially in hard times. And when relatives  friends or neighbours are sick  our compassion arises and we want to come and help them. The virus is using this against us. This is how it spreads. So we need to act from the head rather than the heart  and despite the difficulties  reduce our level of contact. Whereas the virus is a mindless piece of genetic information  we humans have a mind  we can analyse the situation rationally  and we can vary the way we behave.” Given this fractured reality – to be under lockdown or not  the people’s history needs to be written wholly on the ‘teeming millions’ that seem to be thrown into an experiment in eugenics. Fortunately  we have a model  strongly suggested by Aloudat too: the works of Svetlana Alexievich  who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 2015. Her books include The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II (1985  trans. 2017)  Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from the Afghanistan War (1990  trans. 1992)  and Last Witnesses: An Oral History of the Children of World War II (1985  trans. 2019). The first one is a sequential array of interviews of hundreds of among one million-plus Soviet women who went to the war front in World War II. There were nurses  doctors  medical assistant  pilots  tank drivers  machine gunners  snipers. Now these women are surprised at themselves. Alexievich exposed “unfreedom” for women under male authority and exposed the totalitarian face of 20th Century socialism  which was in contrast to the Marxian ideal. “We were silent as fish. We never acknowledged to anybody that we had been at the front. We just kept in touch among ourselves  wrote letters. It was later that they began to honour us  thirty years later… to invite us to meetings… But back then we hid  we didn’t even wear our medals. Men wore them  but not women. Men were victors  heroes  wooers  the war was theirs  but we were looked at with quite different eyes ” said a former anti-aircraft artillery commander. Alexievich met them one by one for seven years (1978-1985). Finally  the book saw the light of day during the Perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. Written in Russian  two million copies were sold within a week The same pattern follows in Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from the Afghanistan War (1990  trans. 1992) with hundreds of interviews with those who lost their sons in Afghanistan. History  the gifted listener with a phenomenal sense of rhythm and repetition ‘humanizes itself  becomes like ordinary life... I’ve happened upon extraordinary storytellers. There are pages in their lives that can rival the best pages of the classics. The person sees herself so clearly from above — from heaven  and from below — from the ground. Before her is the whole path — up and down — from angel to beast. Remembering is not a passionate or dispassionate retelling of a reality that is no more  but a new birth of the past  when time goes in reverse. Above all it is creativity ” writes Alexievich.  Historians are split on oral history as a method of writing history. Marxist Eric Hobsbawm was among those who considered it ahistoriographical. So what? Historians like Alistair Thomson have explored the potential of oral history. This is why endeavours like Tammam Aloudat’s attempt to capture a People’s History of the Corona virus on Facebook are interesting. It is a bulwark against forgetting  against obliterating the memories and consequently  the lessons learnt during this fraught time.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/essay-on-the-need-for-a-people-s-history-of-the-pandemic/story-xtzeaIgpEIu9ry0pIlQHaO.html

Thackeray  while speaking to the media at Vidhan Bhavan  said the state government was insisting on the resumption of suburban services in Mumbai. “We have been demanding from the Centre the resumption of rail services. The hospital staff and other workforce engaged in essential and emergency services are finding it difficult to commute from far-off areas to Mumbai. Some of them are not even able to report for duty. The resumption of locals is very important for the facility of this workforce ” he said. However  senior railway officials in Mumbai have stated there have been no directions from the railway ministry on the starting operation of local trains. “There has been no discussion regarding local trains during any of the video conferences. The outstation train services that have been started are only after discussions and approval from the ministry of home affairs. A decision regarding local train operations will also be taken post discussion with the ministry of home affairs ” said a senior railway official who did want to be named. Thackeray had demanded the resumption of suburban railway services for Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)  during his video conference with prime minister Narendra Modi a month ago. The chief minister said that the government is moving “cautiously” on unlocking the curbs it had put in March to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. The current phase of the lockdown with restrictions will remain till June 30  he said. However  he warned that the government would be compelled to withdraw relaxations if crowding does not reduce and if norms are flouted. The statement comes after there was crowding seen in Mumbai and parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) after restrictions were lifted from Monday. Crowding was seen at bus stops  at promenades during morning and evening walks  etc. Mumbai  and MMR  which includes Thane  Navi Mumbai  Vasai-Virar  Mira-Bhayander  Palghar  Panvel  Raigad  Kalyan-Dombivli  Ulhasnagar  Bhiwandi  was the latest to see relaxationS in curbs. Mumbai and MMR  which crossed the 70 000-mark  have been Covid-19 hotspots since the outbreak. “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed  it still persists. As we continue to battle corona[virus]  we cannot put the brakes on wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day. Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance [while stepping out]. Public transport  including buses and suburban trains  have not been started. The government is evaluating it. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening  then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again ” Thackeray said  adding that he is confident that the people of Maharashtra will continue to listen to the government’s rules and guidelines. Dr Lancelot Pinto  an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital  said that the unlocking of activities would definitely give rise to the number of cases in the state. He added that the people should still continue to only venture if it is essential. “I think there would definitely be a rise in cases. The graph [of cases] is still upward. The unlocking should also be accompanied by adequate educating of people. Unlocking is an economic decision and not because we are confident that all is well. Unfortunately  people do not understand this; they assume that because restrictions are lifted they can go all out. The wise thing is to still step out only if one is doing essential work even though if it is not mandated by law. People are seen walking on promenades; this is luxury ” Pinto said.

If I’m not happy with them  I’m like ‘I have to be able to wear this’.

When you’re in a positive  feel-good mood  there’s definitely more you can do even physically ” Purohit says  adding that compromising on comfort for style may lead you to an unwanted space of “adjusting your clothes or being conscious of what you are wearing” during exercise time.

10/06/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Ravi Dubey: We need keep a tab on our perspectives as only then our outlook will change,Television star Ravi Dubey says that one needs to act responsibly especially during this present phase of lockdown relaxations.,While the government has declared lockdown relaxations  many are not taking the gravity of the Covid-19 situation seriously  and are flouting safety norms. Calling them out on social media  actor Ravi Dubey says everyone needs to learn from the mistakes committed during 1918 Spanish flu. A post shared by Ravi Dubey (@ravidubey2312) on Apr 2  2020 at 11:25pm PDT Talking about it in India’s content  Dubey explains that this relaxation too is only given by the government  and that “Corona hasn’t given any relaxation”. He says  “We have this inherent careless behaviour. It’s time that we understand that we still don’t have a cure for coronavirus  so it is better that we maintain the norms. The government had to give this relaxation to address the economic slowdown. But the disturbing footage of people going out on the streets for no real reason  crowding outside alcohol shops  prove that some of us have got this totally wrong.”  Choti ❤️ A post shared by  Ravi Dubey (@ravidubey2312) on Apr 12  2020 at 5:25am PDT Putting his point forward in his own style  he says  “Nazar rakho nazariyon pe  nazaare badal jayenge”. He explains  “We need keep a tab on our perspectives as then only our outlook would change. There will be good  bad and neutral times. How we tackle them is only a game of perspective. Why not look at it like this that throughout our lives  we are busy working  and now we have time to spend with our loved ones. So let’s enjoy that. But then we are still hearing about relationships falling apart  violence against women and children… I think we all need to introspect.” Dubey is staying positive by watching Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s comedies  which make me happy. “I also write down 20 things I am grateful for every day before going to bed. By the time you write down the first five  the next five come to your mind and then the rest. It changes the way you look at life ” he ends.

I felt free also because after ages I got onto my early morning run route and waved to my usual bhajji wala and fruit wala and acknowledged the usual runners at that time who till date I have never been acquainted to but yes we share the same route and time and we know we exist. I felt free as I splashed thru the puddles and that put a smile on my face ... I felt fear caus people were out and still were nt wearing masks   I did remind a few from a distance though   felt fear also because the spirit of mumbai was missing... it did nt feel as safe as it used to  felt fear about things coming back to normal ... will they ever ??

08/06/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,As Covid pandemic rages  fashion industry adjusts to the ‘new normal’,,As state governments relax Covid-related lockdown conditions and allow commercial activity  many clothing stores have opened their doors  promising safe shopping experience  but there are no takers. When it comes to clothing  most people prefer brick and mortar stores to online shops  because they would like to touch and feel the fabric and try on the clothes before they buy. After all  it is not necessary that a dress that looks beautiful on a model or a mannequin will look good on you . However  today  the fear of catching the dreaded virus is holding back consumers from visiting these shops.  Consumers worry about how many people may have touched the clothes and tried them on and whether any of them was an asymptomatic Covid positive individual. Besides  trying on dresses and tops that you pull over your head is also fraught with danger as the fabric comes in contact with your eyes  nose and mouth - unless you are wearing a mask and a plastic face shield (that may well become a new normal for trying on clothes) . The fact that there is hardly any information on the transmission of Corona virus through clothing or fabrics is also a factor. There is evidence of the virus remaining stable for a few hours to days on various surfaces - on stainless steel and plastic surfaces for two to three days  on cardboard for 24 hours  as per the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But on fabric surfaces  unfortunately  there is scant information on how long the virus may remain. Scientists do say that the virus does not survive long on porous material like clothes   unlike non-porous surfaces like plastic. Besides  porous surfaces tend to trap the virus  making transmission tough. In fact the virus becomes inert and disintegrates relatively faster on porous surfaces   they say. But that’s no consolation for consumers worried about their safety  because authentic and accurate information in this area is still lacking and nobody is ruling out the possibility of contamination of an apparel -even for a relatively short duration – if an infected person coughed or sneezed on it or touched it with contaminated hands. In fact experts warn against shaking any fabric that may be contaminated  as it can release the trapped virus into the air. Since no one knows how long the virus will continue to haunt us  fabric and clothing manufacturers are trying out various options to get the consumers back. A suiting material manufacturer for example  has come up with fabric that inhibits the growth and retention of micro organisms-both bacteria and viruses- up to 50 washes. The fashion industry is also trying various ways of sanitizing clothes - with ozone  ultra violet rays  to mention a few.  More recently  an apparel brand has been offering its clients  one-on-one exclusive virtual shopping experience. Here  you shop from the safety of your home   yet experience the joy of visiting a brick and mortar store   including the interaction with the shop assistant to help you choose what you want   without the risk of Covid-19  through a video call from the store at a time and on a day convenient to you. Whatever you buy is sent home in a factory-sealed packet. These are certainly difficult times for everyone and it will take considerable effort on the part of the fashion/apparel industry to get consumers to buy clothes-either online or through video shopping - in these times of economic slowdown  earning losses  lockdowns and fear of the virus. Besides  in the absence of socializing  consumers are mostly not interested in buying new clothes. So it’s really a tough challenge for the industry.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-pandemic-rages-fashion-industry-adjusts-to-the-new-normal/story-iZhxvyx1MbAfRWwFJJ4djN.html

The actor has even started a helpline for people in the television industry.

Mere do Anmol Ratan. A post shared by  Arjun Bijlani (@arjunbijlani) on May 18  2020 at 7:14am PDT Bijlani adds that too much “moral policing” also leads to “anxiety and depression” among people.  He continues  “Sometimes  it’s important to let people find their own path. We often overburden our children with what’s right and wrong that they forget to use their own thought process and get stressed thinking how they’d be judged if they make a mistake. And these young minds are equally affected by this crisis  so we need to take care of them. Father to a five-year-old son  Ayaan  the actor confesses dealing with depression at a personal level. “I’m a workaholic. Being cooped up in my house  not being able to the sets is frustrating.

Another thing that has bothered Bijlani during this lockdown is reading about the incidents of attack on health and police personnels  besides people flouting safety norms. He asserts  “What some people are doing is unacceptable. But  you never know what inner devils many are fighting. Not justifying any of these acts  I feel most of it is related to deteriorating mental health. It’s important to identify the crisis  accept it and face it headstrong. And ensure that the right message goes out.” The actor is therefore spreading awareness through social media in a subtle way. “We all know the safety measures but many aren’t paying heed. Through my videos  I try and give out the message that this is what I’m doing to stay safe  hoping that might make a difference.” Follow @htshowbiz for more,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/arjun-bijlani-most-of-us-are-dealing-with-stress-doesn-t-matter-whether-we-have-facilities-or-not/story-pyD5RaLTSdipdBuSQZEH9I.html

It all began after her recent chat session on Twitter  when a user asked her to describe Telugu actor Jr NTR in one word and she replied  “I don’t know him. I’m not his fan.” Having worked in South Indian film industry  she also expressed her admiration for actor Mahesh Babu  which further irked these trolls beyond imagination. Putting some tweets out made my @tarak9999 fans. pic.twitter.com/si0n7YLD94 After getting some “30 000 abuses”  the actor decided to take legal action. She tells us  “I’ve always stood up for what’s right. I’d be a hypocrite if I don’t raise my voice against the wrong right now. So  I filed a complaint with Hyderabad City Police and Hyderabad Cyber Crime Cell. They’re looking into the matter and have asked me to file a complaint with Delhi Police since I’m at my home in Delhi now  so that’s also done.” The Section 375 actor even tagged Jr NTR in some of these tweets with an intent to bring to his notice the behaviour of his fans  and hoping he’d take a stand. 🙏 https://t.co/NA0aLw45Ol However  she sounds disappointed when she says  “I’m told such things have happened before also. I don’t know why these stars are still quiet about it. I feel sad for their stardom  for the kind of fan base they have.” Amid the whole Covid-19 situation when one should use social media to spread positivity  there are these trolls that are still spitting venom  rues the actor. “I’m afraid these harmful minds can go to any extent. These accounts should be suspended and they should be punished so we set an example for others having criminal intentions ” says Chopra  who’s now planning to start a campaign where stars need to talk about such things openly.

05/06/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Unlock your home amidst spectacular views,Post lockdown  make the right decision! It’s time to think about the aftermath of the pandemic  which has established the fact that owning an apartment is way better than dealing with the uncertainties of living in a rented accommodation.,In less than eight weeks  Covid-19 has re-ordered virtually every industry in Mumbai. However  this churn will ultimately enable us to re-structure our priorities  ways of living and working to define a new world order. Now that millions of people have understood how important ‘home’ actually is — as a safe haven; a de facto schoolhouse; an impromptu remote office  a space we live in and more importantly  what we demand of it; it’s significance stands to look profoundly different in the post-corona virus world. This top-down re-visioning of luxury real estate specially in south Mumbai will have an outsized  trickle-down impact on how we build; the amenities we use; how we move and interact with one another in public and private places  and what ultimately constitutes ‘space’ for years to come.  So how did a flat-owner in Mumbai feel during lockdown?  To start with  we need to think what has the lockdown given us that we never had enough of? The best answer - time! It’s time to think about the aftermath of the pandemic situation  which has established the fact that owning an apartment is way better than dealing with the uncertainties of living in rented accommodation. People are also realising the importance of having a spacious apartment  which has a sense of expansiveness and is well-designed. Ideally  an apartment should offer optimum views  light and cross ventilation. Thoughtfully- designed  large living spaces with resplendent quality would be one of the important considerations for a home buyer. When social distancing is the new normal  it has become important to stay in a building  where there is less number of families residing in limited apartments. For example  having only two apartments on a floor or having less than 35 families staying in the building.  Almost every person has given a thought to owning a bigger home or a boutique apartment  where amenities like a big kitchen  a temple or prayer room with a study room can be availed. Also many are looking for amenities like in-house gym  a sky garden or a business lounge  where one can practice remote working without feeling the pinch of work-from-home during lockdown. Keeping the complexity of the situation in mind  an ideal mid-size  luxury home with good views  ample sunlight  basic amenities and ready-to- move-in status will be an ideal buyer’s choice.  To be specific  a ready SOBO luxury project with no GST cost  essential amenities  in good neighbourhood  with connectivity to most parts of the city and in proximity of healthcare facilities  should be the buyer’s choice. One should understand the agony and hardships endured when right investments are not made early. Nahar Group recently completed luxury project  Excalibur by Nahar. It is one of the rarest stand-alone buildings in South Mumbai with 34 luxury apartments and offers most essential luxury amenities for post COVID era. Excalibur by Nahar is located at Jacob Circle  Mahalaxmi  and offers mesmerising views of the Racecourse  Arabian Sea and skylines of South Mumbai. This luxury project is ready with an ‘occupation certificate’ and buyers can get immediate possession of their apartments. In many ways Excalibur is already ahead of the curve as it offers technological advancement  timely completion of the project with occupation certificate and essential luxury amenities that residents can enjoy without leaving the building. But as a developer  we are always conscious about adapting our projects to buyers’ needs at any given time. The forms and functions of our architecture and amenities are all based on their demands. With only two apartments on each floor  this 25-storey building is designed in such a way that all the apartments give you uninterrupted view of Mahalaxmi Racecourse and the panoramic view of the Arabian Sea. Talking about the new normal  Excalibur by Nahar has lots to offer. It offers salon services  open-air meditation area  in-house health club and an executive lounge with conference room as well as Sky Garden Café & Bar. Use of technology and engineering excellence is evident everywhere as the project holds the distinction of winning one of the most prestigious awards for Nahar Group - Best Residential Developer of the Year at Global Real Estate & Business Excellence Awards Dubai. In this time of crisis  many of the residential properties in south Mumbai are still under-construction and are suffering from uncertainties over their future. Scarcity of labour and supply chain effect might lead to massive delay in completion of these projects. Excalibur by Nahar has a competitive edge over these projects as it is already completed with occupation certificate and we believe this will draw in buyers  who are looking for immediate possession towards it.

It’s just sad to see people suffer like that ” says Rane. He adds that even if one wants to offer help  “it’s not easy to reach them. I wish I had some superpower to help them”. When it comes to the measures taken by administration in containing the spread of the virus in the country  the 36-year-old feels they’ve done a good job so far. “By imposing lockdown right on time  we’ve saved many lives . Of course  there have been people who flouted the norms  but our police has done a good job. It isn’t easy at all ” he opines.

I’ve started running 10 kms for the first time  and I do this daily in the parking space of my building. I practise cognitive ability games to sharpen my mind.” Besides  Rane has also enrolled himself for an online course on human evolution and also reading books “to understand what inspires people and their journey from being nowhere to somewhere”.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/harshvardhan-rane-i-feel-helpless-looking-at-the-condition-of-migrant-workers-suffering-due-to-lockdown/story-CW7GH6xmbC9d0CnWfyRGnN.html

Excerpts: Over two months into the lockdown...how are you holding up? Sounds strange but it doesn’t feel like so much time has gone by. Honestly  it hasn’t affected me much as I’m used to living on my own  and doing everything without help. So  it’s been therapeutic for me in many ways. I’ve been organising stuff at home  redecorating  making a few pieces of art  and cooking a lot. I realised that I don’t really need a gym.

01/06/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Mumbai sees rise in vehicular traffic due to ‘Mission Begin Again’,Slow-moving traffic was reported in some stretches of the western and eastern express highways. Traffic slowed down outside the vegetable market on Sion-Panvel road and other areas in the suburbs on Monday morning.,An increase in movement of private vehicles was witnessed on the roads of Mumbai on Monday morning as the state government eased some Covid-19-related restrictions and extended the lockdown across Maharashtra till June 30. Slow-moving traffic was reported in some stretches of the western and eastern express highways. Traffic slowed down outside the vegetable market on Sion-Panvel road and other areas in the suburbs on Monday morning.  This came after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced “Mission Begin Again”on Sunday night.  From June 5  all markets  market areas and shops  except malls and market complexes  will be allowed to function on an odd-even basis from 9am to 5pm  the Maharashtra government’s guidelines said. This was also seen as one of the reasons for the increase in vehicular traffic as shopkeepers began to venture out for stocks.  “The nakabandi is underway. We anticipate that traffic will further increase from June 3 ” said additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Padwal.  From June 3  the state has said outdoor physical activities such as cycling  running  jogging and the use of beaches  parks  playgrounds  gardens and promenades will be allowed from 5am to 7pm. Lack of public transport and the need to maintain social distance has resulted in more citizens taking their vehicles out on the roads.  “We are allowing essential services  which includes goods carriers such as tempos and trucks. Local trains are shut while BEST buses are running at half capacity and hence  we expect that the use of private vehicles may increase ” said Padwal.  People took to Twitter to report the increase in traffic. “Unlock 1 started bit early for Mumbai. Mumbai highway started seeing traffic again ” wrote a user.  Some people raised concerns that this may lead to a rise in coronavirus infections  while some said that doctors and nurses and those working for essential services may get affected by the traffic.  All markets  market areas and shops  except malls and market complexes  have been allowed to open on “P1-P2” basis between 9am and 5pm. Shops in one lane will be allowed to open on odd dates while those in another lane be opened on even dates. The government notification  however  warned that failure to observe social distancing norms by such shops and markets will lead to the closure of such commercial establishments immediately.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-rise-in-vehicular-traffic-due-to-mission-begin-again/story-TuVSMO9VeElmYLZnGsgR2L.html

It’s better to fight your inner fears and keep your family happy. The strength you derive from that is much needed ” he adds.

That probably would be more difficult than this ” he warns.

She does breathing exercises and also takes a walk inside the house. My lunch time with her is our pure mother-son time. A proper social distancing is maintained at home  especially when she’s around. She enjoys watching old films with all of us. Everyone sitting doing dinner together is another highlight of our day ” says Shetty  who’s also looking forward to going back to work and finish his films  Marakkar  Fraudster and Mumbai Saga. “But we can’t take the risk now.

26/05/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;singapore,On Covid-19 pandemic  let’s just learn to say  “I don’t know”,The only predictable thing about this pandemic has been its unpredictable nature,The Covid-19 pandemic has posed challenges to every section. The virus has been sneaky  nasty and durable. The rapid spread and large number of fatalities have caused anxiety and exposed the lack of human preparedness for such a medical catastrophe. Our anxiety regarding the future makes us seek quick answers to questions which are not yet available. This has forced scientists and experts to make predictions that are at best intelligent guesses which we start depending on. The drawback is that it shifts the focus from known facts to unknown predictions. The only predictable thing about this pandemic has been its unpredictable nature. No astrologer predicted this calamity was coming. Historians claim history teaches us the best lessons. However  this pandemic has not followed the course of previous corona virus epidemics: SARS-COV1 in 2002-03 and MERS in 2012  both of which resulted in less than 10 000 deaths. The epidemiologists have used basic principles of epidemiology and we now have three to four models  including the Oxford  Imperial College and Swedish models  being pursued at present. Each one claims to be better than the other. Those in the study of graphs and trends have made projections that have not proven right. The John Hopkins projections on trends for India were much worse than what we have seen till now. These charts and trend graphics can mislead  misinform and cause unnecessary panic. They claim to help in better preparedness for dealing with the pandemic. However  they are based on assumptions that are non-scientific. There are many national models of handling this pandemic. The Singapore model involves extensive testing and meticulous contact tracing. The Indian model involved early lockdown. In the UK  they initially pursued herd immunity and were slow in lockdown. They had to quickly change when the number of cases surged. MEDICAL WORLD CHALLENGES Even for doctors  this disease has taught many lessons as it has unfolded. Today  we delay putting patients on ventilation  use anti-coagulants more liberally and monitor some blood parameters that we were not aware of initially. Never in medicine have reputed journals such as The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and Lancet published trials done through accelerated research processes and published them through short cut or no peer reviews. At present  more than 500 clinical drug trials are going on the world over to find the most effective therapy. As better and bigger trials become available  we will have the right answers. We seem to have lost balance on the emotional to rational scale. This scale has tilted towards the emotional side. Medicine has never been exposed so much to the electronic and social media as now. Media exposure has its own downside. One has seen the annual budget being presented and analysed by four experts simultaneously in divergent directions. This is done without giving any time for assessment and evaluation. Medical treatment and institution of newer therapies need a scientific basis which is analysed and then evaluated by clinical trials for safety. A knee-jerk response can be harmful and dangerous. As students  we were taught that the five best teachers are who  why  where  when and how. Unless we question a thought and then evaluate it scientifically  we cannot find the right answer. At this time of crisis  we seem to conjecture  imagine and give explanations to preconceived ideas. Let us have the humility to accept that we do not know a lot of things regarding this pandemic. The first step towards solving a problem is to accept it. THE WAY TO GO We know for sure what helps us is social distancing  frequent hand washing  avoiding crowds  use of masks  cough hygiene and isolation of affected individuals. We have to take special care of vulnerable groups such as the elderly  specially with co-morbidities such as hypertension  diabetes  obesity  smoking and heart disease. Luckily  82% of India’s population is less than 50 years. General improvement of health and immunity with good diet  proper sleep  mental relaxation  yoga and meditation and regular exercise will be useful. Honest and early reporting of symptoms of fever and cough should be done. Those with these symptoms need to be isolated and separated from family members. Hospitals have to admit patients who have breathing difficulty and other complications. The medical community now knows the best practices to be followed from the data of the global epicentres of this pandemic. India has the advantage of late onset of the epidemic due to the early lockdown. There are still significant gaps in our knowledge which will be filled by some large studies such as the ongoing solidarity study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Beyond these facts and features of the disease  the future course of this pandemic cannot be predicted. The optimists and the pessimists give different opinions. We have to leave it all on the Almighty just as we leave everything else in our life. Each one of us has to discipline ourselves and do our bit to control it from spreading further. Let us remember the serenity prayer: “God  grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and the wisdom to know the difference.” The writer is professor of cardiology and chairman  research and development centre at Dayanand Medical College & Hospital  Ludhiana.

26/05/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Spike in deaths  cases with unknown history  major causes of concern for J&K govt,The state government said strict police is being enforced for red zones and containment areas,The Jammu and Kashmir government on Monday said that spike in deaths and cases with unknown history were the major causes of concern for it and therefore strict police is being enforced for red zones and containment areas. Addressing media here Monday evening  Principal Secretary Rohit Kansal  however  informed that with the testing rate of over 10 000 per million Jammu and Kashmir has now become number one in the country in testing. “The testing capacity in the UT has gone up from just about 100 tests a day in March to 8000 tests a day today. In the last one month alone it has gone up from 1800 tests a day to 8100 a day – an increase of 350 percent ” he said. He said that aggressive and sustained testing is the only effective weapon against the disease and the administration shall continue to pursue it effectively. On the efforts to of the administration in combating the situation arising out of Corona Virus and the COVID 19 pandemic for the last more than 8 weeks  Kansal said that the Government has taken a slew of measures on the health  economic and welfare fronts. “Jammu and Kashmir was probably one of the first states or UTs to take note of the emerging situation and initiate action and many of our interventions have not only been been fast but effective too. It may be recalled that the total number of COVID 19 cases in J&K is 1668  out of which 1374 are from Kashmir division and 294 are from Jammu division. The number of active cases is 836 of which 620 are in Kashmir Division and 216 are in Jammu division. As many as 809 recoveries which include young children and 23 unfortunate deaths have also been reported. A total of over 1.34 lakh persons have been enlisted for surveillance out of which over 72 000 have completed mandatory period of surveillance. 47 new Covid positive cases have been reported today  out of which 33 cases are from Jammu division and 14 cases are from Kashmir. As per the media bulletin of the health department  no recovery has been reported today. Kansal pointed out that while J&K had been able to achieve a low growth rate and a doubling rate of over 3 weeks  this should not become a cause of complacency. Reminding that effective lockdown  strong containment policy  aggressive testing and cooperation by the people of J&K has played a key role in containment of COVID 19  the spokesperson said that there is no room for any laxity. “What we now need is to understand that there are enough worrying factors in the situation. 15 deaths have been reported in last month alone. There is at least one district which has more than 200 active cases and at least one district with more than 150 active cases. There are at least 2 districts where the number of active cases per million are higher than 150. At least half of the districts have a doubling rate less than 14 days. At least 2 districts have seen a considerable increase in cases even when there are no returnees. In fact  there are many areas where the positivity rate of cases is much higher for local population than for returnees.” he said and added that a number of local  indigenous cases for which contact chains are not yet fully clear have also been reported which is a cause of concern. He said that over 90 000 stranded persons have already returned to J&K in the last 4 weeks alone  they include 66024 persons by road  25400 by 30 Shramik special and COVID special Rajdhani trains and 652 persons by air. “J&K is the one state/UT which has smoothly completed more than 85% of its evacuation process. The government has consciously adopted a policy of testing 100% of all returnees. All the returnees are being tested  and as a result of the strategy the administration has been successful in tracing 481 positive cases so far.” By testing people at the entry point we are ensuring that positive cases are traced and isolated at the entry point itself  thereby avoiding any infections getting into the community”  he added. Emphasizing on the importance of economy and livelihoods  Kansal said that UT Government has issued SoPs for the reopening of markets  industry and trade. Similarly SOPs have been issued for returnees and passengers. “But as responsible citizens we need to realize that any complacency or letting down of the guard can cost us very dearly. In red zones and containment zones  there is a need to be vigilant otherwise all the efforts of the last 2 months will be wasted ” he cautioned. The spokesperson appealed people to stay at home and go out of their homes only if it is absolutely necessary and follow the advisories  wear a mask  and practice social distancing. “Remember  the virus is alive  it is active and it has given no relaxation. So  our self restraint and discipline must continue  he warned.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-deaths-cases-with-unknown-history-major-causes-of-concern-for-j-k-govt/story-9L1xogtgHSd8jpE6h66iqM.html

25/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Covid-19 crisis makes struggle tougher for aspiring actors: No shoots  no money  can’t go back home,With film and television shoots on a halt during the ongoing pandemic  aspiring actors share the woes they are facing in Mumbai.,The lockdown experience hasn’t been smooth for anyone  even though it is the most essential step in putting a check on the spread of Covid-19 virus. Like all businesses  the Hindi film and television industry too has been affected badly. No shoots means no work for the actors  junior artistes and technicians. While help for them has been pouring in  there is a section of people for whom the struggle has been harder: the struggling actors who come to Mumbai with dreams to make it big. They depend on the money they get from assignments on a daily basis  but with nothing being shot  they are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Rupesh  a casting co-ordinator  tells us the real situation. “As of now  these aspiring actors are facing the rent problem... But mostly  people will go back to the pavilion. They are thinking of that  because we don’t know till when the lockdown will be there ” he tells us. Read more: Bollywood dancers hit hard by Covid-19 crisis  say ‘There’ll be no shoots the entire year  but we survive on per day income’ Sachin Sharma  who has been trying his luck in showbiz for three years now  says it’s very “difficult to survive right now”. “I’ve been auditioning for lead roles and was supposed to do some TV shows in the last three-four months. Unfortunately  the lockdown happened. I live in Andheri  and I have to take money from my parents  there is no option left for us. The rent we are not paying this month  maybe next month too we won’t have to. We have no work  we cannot do anything ” tells us the 24-year-old  who hails from Jharkhand. Rupesh adds that most of these newbies stay in either PG accommodations  or rent apartments together. Since many of them went back to their home town  in a few cases  only one person is left to bear the burden of expenses.

When we need milk  we need to tell the police officers here  and they announce to ask if anyone needs anything ” he says. Having been in Mumbai for over three years now. Krishnan further says that his payment is still stuck for the few assignments he managed to do earlier. “The first month  I had to use up my savings  plus you anyway get your money after 90 days.

25/05/2020,technology;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;mali,STEAM education can lead to innovation and creativity,The schools have been closed and children are learning from home. With all the daily routines and activities disrupted  it is easy to feel like a victim of the Covid-19 crisis.,There is a lot to talk about the unprecedented challenges and impacts the Covid-19 crisis has put in front of us. Almost every sector has been hit hard  including children’s education too. The schools have been closed and children are learning from home. With all the daily routines and activities disrupted  it is easy to feel like a victim of the Covid-19 crisis. But there’s a silent hero that is bringing a change in the mindset of students  parents as well the teachers. Amidst the novel Corona Virus crisis  many students are coming up with innovative and creative solutions in order to bring a change in the mindset of the society and minimise the damage and turn the situation into an opportunity. Yes  students are leveraging the STEAM skills in order to provide solutions to real-world problems by making the best use of their logical mindset  analytical and computational skills  cognitive approach etc. STEAM and Innovation - Future Ready STEAM Education is an interdisciplinary fusion of multiple fields (Science  Technology  Engineering  Arts and Mathematics) that aims to strengthen the core skills of the students and help them recognize their inner potential. The number of schools incorporating STEAM principles has increased exponentially in the past few years. According to a joint survey conducted by NITI Aayog and AIM  more than 6 million students have access to STEAM education facilities in their schools in India alone. Right from the invention of the Wheel  Man has been continuously thriving. The thirst for development and upliftment of technology has never been stopped  and mankind continues to flourish through the advancement in technologies. Our educational system is tasked with preparing the next-gen leaders to succeed in life. But somewhere  we had been failing in incorporating critical-thinking skills and an innovative mindset in our children.  STEAM Education supports students to understand the fundamental laws of nature in a multi-disciplined way  transforming the mind of the student in the form of centralized innovation  and fostering their ability to solve problems. It gives students the right tools and approaches to explore new and creative ways of problem-solving  tinkering  pattern recognitions  and adjoining multiple domains. Over the past few years  there has been a dramatic rise in the patents filed by the students. A joint venture by NITI Aayog and AIM is promoting students to file patents and providing a workspace in the schools to quench the thirsts of the students for Innovation and Tinkering. To tackle the negative impacts of Covid-19  students are taking the charge to save the mankind. Many students have come up with “Automatic Hand Sanitizers”  to prevent the spread of Corona Virus. Young minds are also creating awareness through their coding skills  and developing animated stories and games to create awareness in the society. Early age Entrepeneurs – All Thanks to STEAM education  STEAM education in India is promoting the culture of Start-ups and entrepreneurship right from the early age. The government is taking many initiatives  including the ATL Marathon contest  where the students have to come up with the solutions to tackle the existing problems in the society. In 2018  around 5000 students participated in the competition where more than 1400 submissions were received. The Top 50 teams were called in for a 15 day Internship at IBM Bengaluru Campus  where all the innovators learned the essentials of entrepreneurship using  STEAM education skills. STEAM education is motivating students to adapt an innovative mindset and come up with creative solutions. The industries are leaving no stone unturned and are providing platforms for students to showcase their innovative skills. Competitions  Online Hackathons and Challenges are being organized from time to time  where students participate and thrive to create something innovative. Even in this lockdown period  students are making the best use of the time and are coming up with innovative solutions. A student designed and developed a prototype of a 3D printed facial mask to combat the novel virus. Many students have even developed minimalistic designs of Automatic Hand Sanitizers  and industries are taking forward their innovations to make it available for the masses. According to PWC’s Innovation Benchmark 2017  54% of innovating companies struggle to bridge the gap between innovation strategy and business strategy. This is the reason why big giants like Cisco  PepsiCo  Microsoft  and Google own initiatives to encourage STEAM education and skills development globally. In a survey conducted by the Education Commission of the States  STEAM jobs are likely to grow up by 13%  whereas all the other jobs will grow only by 9%. The hike is certain because many industries are embracing the concept of STEAM education and the need for innovative programs is rapidly increasing. The industries are focusing on long-term strategies  by hiring candidates with potential STEAM skills  which is far better than training and educating the workforce on occupation-specific skills. The Central Board of Secondary Education (C.B.S.E) is also taking measures in promoting skill-based subjects  realising the uncapped potential of STEAM education. The Board will offer a choice to the students to opt from nine subjects which cover a wide variety of 21 st century skills including Artificial Intelligence  Design Thinking etc. STEAM education will play a crucial role in building the right mindset and providing an ecosystem for students to hone their innovation and creativity skills. In this rapidly changing world  we need more innovators  tinkerers  and creators to provide sustainable development and better future alternatives. STEAM education is a proven model of accelerating the mindset right in the direction of crucial skills like Logical thinking  Computational thinking  Analytical skills  Critical thinking  and Creativity. All these skills put together will lead towards an innovative mindset  which will help students to have a better understanding of past and present cultures and aesthetics  moral values  and human nature  which in turn lead to progressive social development also. STEAM education teaching is not to impart content-based knowledge  but to develop students’ problem-solving ability and looking up for innovative solutions as an end goal.

While many actors  filmmakers have extended support via Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) and Cine And TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA)  many allege they haven’t received any help yet. #FWICEFightsCorona #IndiaFightsCorona @narendramodi @OfficeofUT @BNTiwar16902945 @ashokepandit @Ashokdubey44 @gangeshwaronweb pic.twitter.com/Ampg3v6WlC Saraswati Gupta  a hairstylist who lives with her three children and husband  shares  “Whoever works in the industry needs to be a member of one of the associations. I’m also a member of hair and make-up association. Till now I have only received 20% of what was promised. Call par bus bolte hai mil jayega ” she says. Her colleague  MK Naveen  wig-maker and make-up artiste has faced a similar experience: “Bus ek baar thoda ration mila tha. Pata nahi kab tak do bachche aur biwi ko khila paunga… Mere bahut pehchaan waalon ko kuch nahi mila.” Hassan Sheikh  a technician  says he received Rs 3 000 from Salman Khan  but he’s worried about payments that are stuck. Prakash Tiwari  who’s into costume making  says it’s getting difficult for him to pay his staff as days are passing by. Pointing out that production designers and prop makers are in a bad condition  art director Sneha Bhandare adds  “Payments of many of these freelancers are stuck. With lockdown extension  we don’t know how will they survive.” she says. Suniel Kasbe  AdHoc General Secretary  Costume  Make-Up Artists and Hairdresser Association  says  “We requested Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) general secretary Ashok Dubey to help  but nothing happened. They are supporting those who are on good terms with them. Once the lockdown ends  workers who haven’t got anything  will protest.” While spot boy Shubham Singh shares the fear of losing out work if they protest  make-up artiste Prashant Kamle  questions  “Donations of around Rs 20 crore came to the federation. Who have they been distributed to? Some production houses donated ration for 4 000 people but the federation distributed to around 500 people and they clicked their picture just to show that they have distributed. No food coupons were distributed to my unit members. After the lockdown gets over  we’re going to ask the celebrity and the Federation where did all the donated funds go ” Kamle says. Ashoke Pandit  chief advisor  FWICE  and president  Indian Film & Television Directors’ Association  explains there are 32 organisations with 500 00 members under FWICE. The association has written to all the organisations and messaged all members.“Among those 500 00  only 100 000 have requested support. We’ve asked for names  registered mobile numbers  account numbers  IFSC codes from all and started bank transfers. While Salman Khan has extended support directly to 25 000 workers  Yash Raj Films helped 3 000 of them. Apart from these people  we’ve have started sending money to others. We’ve also distributed ration and food coupons ” he says. सलमान खान ने 45 वर्टिकली चैलेंज्ड कलाकारों को वित्तीय सहायता प्रदान कीविस्तार से पढ़े यहाँ:https://t.co/po6HtzXhMZ pic.twitter.com/AVabEpAAVs But what about those who haven’t received anything? Also is there a possibility of increasing the amount for a bigger family as compared to a nuclear one? “Some have shared wrong IFSC codes  incorrect spellings and phone numbers. There are others who have shared their details to different organisations and have received money twice or thrice. So we’re sorting these things out. Everyone will get help. As far as increasing money for bigger families are concerned  we’re yet to take a call ” he adds. CINTAA senior joint secretary & chairman  Outreach Committee  Amit Behl  seconds Pandit regarding those sharing wrong IFSC code as that “halts the process”. He adds  “The condition of actors who do small roles are worse.

24/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,Bollywood’s lockdown beard diaries: To keep or not to keep!,Some celebrities are choosing to go clean-shaven after weeks of keeping a beard  and some are choosing to keep the facial hair intact for a bit longer. We take a dekko.,Black and grey  thick and grizzled  patchy or stubble -- Bollywood actors caught amid the lockdown extensions to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic  are having their own beard moments. With salons and stylists being out of reach during the lockdown  actors such as Kartik Aaryan and Arjun Rampal took it upon themselves to go back to a cleaner look by shaving off their facial hair. Arjun  who sought his partner Gabriella Demetriades’ help to shave off his thick beard  took to Instagram to share a video for fans.  The extended quarantine has got the better of my beard. Time to let it go!!!!hopefully it grows back before filming commences.... #hairtodaygonetomorrow A post shared by  Arjun (@rampal72) on May 17  2020 at 10:55pm PDT After it was done  he was rather excited as he wrote  “All done  back to being civilised. Yay or Nay? #iseeme.” When his celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim expressed surprise on the social media post  Rampal quipped  “Had to bro  didn’t have you looking after it for me.” Aaryan  who reached out to his Instagram fans to poll for his “sexy or jungli” look  surprised them by getting rid of the fuzzy beard that he grew during quarantine  by sharing a quirky video. Rajeev Sen  who has gone cleanshaven and shared his look  wrote: “Change is the only constant. #lockdown4.0 #whosaysidontlookhandsomeshaven.”  The world is grappling with a pandemic and I have question fatigue on what's the best way for govts to restart after lockdown  what will life be like  will vaccines be mandatory  which businesses will do well  is my immunity dropping sitting at home  should I become a farmer  what is the meaning of happiness 😋 . . . . so a simple question for me today is Beard ??? Or no beard ?????? . . . . #lockdown 📷 @ankita_earthy A post shared by  Milind Usha Soman (@milindrunning) on May 14  2020 at 11:49pm PDT There are other actors who are still growing their beard  and perhaps contemplating what to do with it. For one  there’s Milind Soman  who pointed out his “question fatigue” on issues such as “what will life be like  will vaccines be mandatory... should I become a farmer”  during the pandemic. And so  he raised a “simple question”: “Beard ??? Or no beard ???” His wife Ankita Konwar was upfront: “A bearded farmer.” Even Shahid Kapoor posted a funky video showcasing a his beard  and wrote: “Entering quarantine phase 4 be like.... @mira.kapoor can’t deal no more with me.” There’s also Riteish Deshmukh  who’s going grey with his hair and beard; Vicky Kaushal who’s bearded photographs on his social media page are winning hearts; Saif Ali Khan; and even Ranveer Singh  the actor who keeps experimenting with his looks one film after another  let his fans get a glimpse of his heavily bearded avatar in the lockdown during an Instagram live session. Darshan Yewalekar  the man behind Singh’s in Ram-Leela  Padmaavat and Simmba  says he has been receiving several queries from his celebrity clients and regular ones too  about the right way to groom overgrown hair and beard. While he believes these are an “art” that a stylist acquires with years of experience and recommends that people should not take matters in their own hands even if they are itching to get cleaner looks. Yewalekar  however  suggests “use of water and a little oil to keep messy hair and beard in place for any video calls or conferences to keep it neat”  and says “men need to keep their facial hair hygienic and must oil and shampoo it time-to-time”.  हाल कैसा है जनाब का? A post shared by  Vicky Kaushal (@vickykaushal09) on May 8  2020 at 6:33am PDT Beauty expert Bharti Taneja notes that “even in the pre-lockdown times  male celebs were maintaining different bearded looks”  but once lockdown ends  she feels it will be better for them to get rid of their beard because not only will it be “more comfortable to wear a mask” but also more “hygienic”. Besides  even if the actors continue to have a beard  they won’t be able to flaunt them too well due to masks when they step out. We wonder then if clean-shaven be the next style statement?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/bollywood-s-lockdown-beard-diaries-to-keep-or-not-to-keep/story-SBII2E93CuOkJIskDurXbK.html

I did a few things to keep myself busy. Initially  I was thinking ‘what can I do sitting at home  I am an actor  how do I keep myself busy?’ But one needs to involve themselves  otherwise laziness can set in. I started watching new season of shows I had seen  and then started writing too.

Our house is always overflowing with guests. But I decided to go with the flow and not fret about when the lockdown will end ” says Shabana Azmi who has been under lockdown ten days before it was announced as she returned from Budapest on March 15 after shooting for her international project.   Heartbreaking .. A post shared by  Shabana Azmi (@azmishabana18) on May 19  2020 at 8:58am PDT The actor has kept her spirits buoyant by engaging in various creative pursuits  “I surrendered myself and started enjoying the time I am getting to be with Javed (Akthar  her husband). We spend a great amount of time together but also wander off into our own spaces so we are not breathing down each others neck constantly. I have been reading  writing  listening to music  giving talks and even participating in webinars ” she says. In an effort to join forces  the actor along with her husband has been doing her bit to help the needy  “We have been doing a lot of relief work through the NGO that was started by my father Kaifi Azmi. We have distributed food grains   health kits and masks to more than 22000 people in different villages in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. We have also setup Rozgar dhaba   an information hub for the returning migrants on government schemes  job opportunities  making ration and aadahar cards.

The actor has recorded venerated Professor Tabish Khair’s story  River Of No Return  “I was moved by the story and it struck a chord. Also the idea of getting writers from across the world to share their creative responses and have actors doing dramatised readings had a novel feel to it. In times of crisis the artist must rise to the challenge and try to make sense from the chaos ” she explains. Given the lockdown  her footage was shot on an a phone by herself. Talking about the experience she says  “As an actor I have a cushy position because everything gets set up for me. I am only needed to learn my lines   take the light  hit my mark and rev up the emotion. But here it was me who was setting up everything so it was a unique experience. It was a new experience to work with the Tony Award-winning director Michael Myers on a virtual platform without having ever met him. Because of the difference in time I couldn’t get an immediate reaction from him. By the time he could watch the footage  the green chroma background and the lights had already been dismantled. Thankfully he was satisfied with what he got.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/i-am-enjoying-spending-time-with-javed-shabana-azmi/story-nSue08NuYwXflk7IBQiUUK.html
22/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;oman,Shabana Azmi’s words of wisdom amid Covid-19: Health is a right  but it’s also a responsibility,The veteran actor has urged people to stay home as “there’s no heroism in breaking rules”  and talks to us about what has been keeping her busy in the lockdown.,“The sky has never been so blue  the birds have never twittered more sweetly.” Veteran actor Shabana Azmi does poetic justice to the virtues of the lockdown  but also points out at the need of “policy and governance that is inclusive and answerable to the weaker sections (of the society)  and also in sync with Nature”. In an interview  she also talks about getting to spend more time with husband  writer Javed Akhtar; supporting relief efforts amid the crisis; and her “miraculous” survival in a near fatal accident. How are you both coping with the lockdown? Going with the flow. I returned from my shooting in Budapest on 15th March and went into self-isolation for 2 weeks by which time the lockdown was already in place so it has been a very long time. For someone as gregarious as me  I could never have imagined that I would stay sane. Javed is used to periods of isolation when he is writing  so it was easier on him. But we have never spent so much time together and we have always enjoyed each other’s company  so it has been good for us personally. But the plight of the migrant labourers tears into your conscience and makes you reflect more deeply on the great divide between the haves and the have-nots. How fragile our public health system is  how important it is to have social security and how much more inclusive our policies need to be.  We used to sing together. ❤️❤️ A post shared by  Shabana Azmi (@azmishabana18) on May 10  2020 at 12:13am PDT After an accident as serious as you had in January  you recuperated and went to Budapest to shoot  returning to Mumbai just in time before a life-altering lockdown was implemented in India. Do you see it as a second life? Ever since I lost my mother in November  it has been a roller coaster sliding downwards. Except for 3 wonderful days in January  when we celebrated Javed’s birthday and had friends and family come in from all over - Rupankan  a cultural organisation from Indore  held a photo exhibition of Javed by photographer Pradeep Chandra and SMM Ausaja where a jewelled fountainpen in Javed’s name was launched. A calendar on Javed was also released. The next night we had an intimate Bollywood 70’s theme party at home  followed by a big bash on his birthday on 17th January. I was dancing till 5 in the morning! We left for our Khandala home Sukoon the next afternoon with Javed’s cousin sister Sumbul and her husband Nawab. I was very tired from the 3 days of partying so I requested that Javed carry on with them and I follow in the next car to catch up on my sleep. About twenty minutes before we could reach home  a truck rammed into my car . I was asleep at the back and rolled off from my seat to the floor. The impact caused me to faint. Mercifullly  I remember nothing at all. I’ve been told it was a miracle I had survived. A month and ten days later  still in considerable pain  I was shooting in Budapest! And then we had to pack up because of the coronavirus spreading to Europe. I reached Mumbai on 15th March  went into self-isolation  by which time the lockdown was already in place! I’ve been at home for over 60 days. Is this going to be the new normal? I hope not. I like to be surrounded by family and friends . Poetry  Love and Food. 😍@AzmiShabana @Javedakhtarjadu pic.twitter.com/yjO3H3ohIS It was so pleasant to hear you sing the ‘Abhi na jao chhodkar’ parody made by Javed saab  and the ‘nok-jhok’ on a video interview. It shows the importance of keeping a home atmosphere infused with fun and romance in our own ways. Your comment? It is very important to keep the atmosphere at home pleasant  not just for yourselves but also for our staff who are away from their families. I keep in touch with my girls group on zoom where we let off steam because some of them are having to do all their housework without any help. But we also talk about trivial things and have a good laugh. And we are in regular touch with our families. I miss my mother and feel extremely sad that I could have spent so much time with her. As a senior citizen yourself  what is the message you would want to convey to the elders and youngsters in terms of taking the right care? We must remember that health is a right  but it’s also a responsibility. As seniors  it is important that we play by the rules and not break away from the required protocol. Maintain social distancing  wash hands with soap frequently  stay indoors  boost our immunity. There is no heroism in breaking rules. We owe it to ourselves and to society to keep ourselves informed and lead by example.  Reading   writing  .. They say Creativity flourishes in isolation .. A post shared by  Shabana Azmi (@azmishabana18) on May 17  2020 at 10:11pm PDT What does your typical day look like amid the lockdown  and what keeps you busy? Reading  writing  listening to music  giving talks  participating in webinars. I’m also involved hands on in all the relief work being done by Mijwan Welfare Society  an NGO founded by my father Kaifi Azmi  which I now head. We have distributed foodgrains   health kits and masks to more than 22 000 people in different villages in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. We have also set up Rozgar dhaba  an information hub for the returning migrants on government schemes  job opportunities  making ration and Aadhar cards  etc... to me  that is the most important empowerment tool we can give them. Here in Mumbai  both Javed and I are providing cooked meals. And yet it’s only a drop in the ocean. The pandemic has exposed the fragile structure of our public health system and the lack of a social security cover makes the poor even more vulnerable  particularly women and children. We need policy and governance that is inclusive and answerable to the weaker sections and one that is in sync with Nature. The sky has never been so blue the birds have never twittered more sweetly. There is a lesson in it for all of us.

Find out!,From going out for a long drive across Mumbai and hitting the gym to eating out at a favourite restaurant and catching up with friends -- celebs talk about what they are craving to do once the lockdown is lifted. Taapsee Pannu: I’m a big foodie and I want to eat out different cuisines which I can’t cook. I miss sitting in a cafe with my friends  talking to them  and enjoying the view out of the window. I miss greeting people with warm hugs and smiles. I’m looking forward to getting back to work because a lot of my films have been put on hold.  Bhumi Pednekar: I want to go to a proper gym and sweat it out. Every day  I workout at home but I miss the vibe of a gym workout. I also want to start working. Nushrat Bharucha: I miss hanging out with my bunch of friends which I will be doing once all of this is over. I miss working as I’m a complete workaholic. I want to go to the sets and start shooting and express  emote and act.  Yami Gautam: My mom really wants me to come home for sometime when things become better. And by better  she means when there’s a flight service. I don’t know if I’m going to go immediately though... All of us have been hit and we’re definitely going to be more cautious. Suniel Shetty: Just aimlessly drive through the streets of Mumbai and see how the city is. Nidhhi Agerwal: I’ve taken this lockdown very seriously  and not even taken one step out of my house. So when it ends  the first thing I would probably do is go out for a run  or eat an ice-cream  go to a restaurant and have coffee.  Huma Qureshi: I just want to meet my parents as soon as this is over. They are in Delhi and as soon as all this is over  I am going to book my tickets and just go and see them and hug them.

20/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;cuba;india;singapore,Covid-19 crisis: Asymptomatic people can infect surfaces,Different surfaces in the hotel rooms of two students  who returned to China from studying abroad on March 19 and March 20  without symptoms were tested three hours after they tested positive on the second day in quarantine  according to the study.,In a finding that has major implications for people using public transport and sharing office space as the lockdown is relaxed  in India  a study has found that asymptomatic and presymtomatic people with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are highly infectious and can extensively contaminate the environment in a very short time. Different surfaces in the hotel rooms of two students  who returned to China from studying abroad on March 19 and March 20  without symptoms were tested three hours after they tested positive on the second day in quarantine  according to the study. Eight of the 22 samples collected from the two rooms tested positive for Covid-19.These included door handles  light switches  faucets  thermometers  TV remotes  pillows  duvet covers  sheets  towels  bathroom door handles  toilet seats and flushing buttons  said the study  which was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The detection of Sars-CoV-2 RNA (genetic material) in the surface samples of the sheet  duvet cover  and pillow cover highlights the importance of proper handling procedures when changing or laundering used linens of SARS-CoV-2 patients ” concluded researchers. What has fuelled the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is the long incubation period of the infection  which  on average  takes 5.1 days to show symptoms  according to a study published in March in The Annals of Internal Medicine. During this period  patients do not develop symptoms of cough  fever or difficulty in breathing but begin spreading the infection. Some people have no symptoms because they have mild disease or because they are pre-symptomatic  but they can be highly infective. Young  healthy people are more likely to have mild or no symptoms compared to older people and those with chronic illnesses. “Studies show infected people take on average five to six days to develop symptoms  but are infective from day one. Lockdowns prevent undiagnosed infected people from stepping out and infecting others  but with less restricted travel  chances of exposure increase  especially because it is a younger  healthier workforce that is the most mobile ” said Dr Ambarish Dutta  associate professor of epidemiology and public health  Indian Institute of Public Health  Bhubaneswar.  An earlier study published in the journal  Nature Medicine  on April 15 found around 44% infections were spread by people with no symptoms  with people with Covid-19 being the most infectious two or three days before the symptoms appear. Another study in March found 48% cases in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin  China  were spread by people with no symptoms. The risk of infection and severe disease is higher in older people  men  the obese  the poor  those living in densely populated areas  and people with chronic kidney disease. “As lockdown lifts and people become mobile  social distancing  wearing masks and hand washing will be the only defence against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)  for which there is no approved vaccine or cure ” said Dr Dutta.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asymptomatic-people-can-infect-surfaces/story-9kQUjvmp1c2GPIxf4OeheP.html

19/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,canada,Our industry has been at the forefront of pain for some time: Raghav Mathur,Canada-based singer and songwriter Raghav Mathur  known for the 2005 hit Angel Eyes  talks about technology’s impact on musicians  and warns people to be wary of mediocre content.,It is a testing time for performing artists all over the world  as the battle against Covid -19 rages on. However  the silver lining to all this lockdown and social distancing is the fact that  many of them have got the chance to connect with their families in a way they could never before. Singer-songwriter Raghav Mathur has been on the move for the “last 15 years” of his life  feels “blessed” that he is able to spend time with her four-year-old daughter  Riya.  “I’ve been spending as much as possible time with my four-year-old daughter  Riya. Being a musician in Canada who tours globally means a lot of planes and hotels these last 15 years  and a lot of time away from home. Making up for it now is a blessing. She is everything I could have ever hoped for in a kid. I’m blessed ” says Raghav who has recently released his single  Sufi  on the music streaming platform Jio Saavn.  The 39-year-old  feels that the immediate future looks grim for musicians because of lack of live shows  and feels that the Internet will remain the only way for artists to interact with their fanbase  which has not been as lucrative as other platforms have been in the past.  “This is going to be yet another transitional time for music  our industry has been at the forefront of pain for some time in terms of how technology has impacted the various income sources for artists  yet through it  all artists have remained resilient and used our creativity to adapt. The income lost now in touring income  and the danger of how that looks for the foreseeable future is a cause of great concern ” he says  however adding that he has “no doubt” that the respect for artists will go up after the crisis ends.  “I have no doubt  however  that through all this  as we sit in our homes  listening to music and watching movies to help us all cope with the situation  the collective value of music and art has never been higher  and perhaps artists will benefit in the future from us all being reminded of that value it has in our lives ” he says.  The Toronto-born singer is also happy that the Internet has helped musicians to release their music  but remains wary of content which is “mediocre art that we are told is excellent”. “It’s going to remain complicated but the power of what works in music will always remain with the listener. The internet has played a significant role in both introducing us to things we would have no access to before and also inundating us with mediocre art that we are told is excellent ” says Raghav.  Known for his hits such as So Confused (2003)  Can’t Get Enough (2004) and Angel Eyes (2005)  Raghav feels lucky to have been able to create a space for himself in the industry  and feels that in his 15-year-long career  he has succeeded only when he has made music that comes from his heart.   “ I know I have a unique place as an artist and it’s been important to me to be true to that. It’s both created a lane that has given me much adulation and also been an encumbrance in the eyes of those who would prefer to pin me down to one more marketable but culturally ambiguous product. I know this for sure though  when I’ve made music that I love and feel proud of I’ve been happier and when I’ve ever wavered from that  I’ve been less convinced of the artistic result. It’s a learning process. If you are trying to keep up with something or chase a sound  you’ve already lost the race ” he signs off.

And as work has come to a halt amid the Covid-19 pandemic  it has made the situation worse. Not keen to reveal the name of the production house  the actor has sought help from Cine And TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA). She was  however  so moved when her makeup artist Pankaj Gupta offered Rs 15 000 to help her  that she even appreciated his gesture via social media. “My earnings run my house. My mother is a homemaker  and father is a heart patient. His medicine costs are there. We had bought a house  and we have to pay the EMIs.

But  not many know that these celebs  too  in a way got stuck wherever they are right now  however  they’re making the most of this time in the lap of nature.

It’s a fantastic place ” says Bajpayee  who is watching a lot of web content  reading  and spending time with family.  #VocalForLocal A post shared by  Neena Gupta (@neena_gupta) on May 13  2020 at 10:54pm PDT Neena Gupta decided to spend some time at her house in Mukteshwar  along with her husband around in March and she couldn’t return to Mumbai because of the lockdown.

16/05/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,Sunglasses with distance sensors to touchless doorbell: Delhi-NCR students turn innovators to fight Covid-19,It is not just scientists and leading technical institutions in the country who are aiding the fight against COVID-19 but also several school students who have come up with innovations such as sunglasses with distance sensors  portable ventilators and touchless doorbells.,It is not just scientists and leading technical institutions in the country who are aiding the fight against COVID-19 but also several school students who have come up with innovations such as sunglasses with distance sensors  portable ventilators and touchless doorbells.    Sarthak Jain  a class 11 student of Modern Public School in Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh  has developed Arduino -- an automated touchless doorbell with ultrasonic sensors to ensure the visitor does not have to touch the bell and minimise chance of corona virus spread. “As doorbell is a medium of transferring virus it is used maximum times in our daily routine and hence the chances of spreading the virus increases ” he said. “So  using Arduino  an open-source electronic prototyping platform  I have developed a doorbell with sensors which can detect presence of a person or object within a  distance of 30 to 50 cm and produce a beep sound from the buzzer without  the  person  having to ring the bell ” he added. Shivam Mukherjee  a class 9 student of Amity International School here  has invented a sanitisation band called ‘Abhay’.  “It is a simple band that can be worn around the wrist. Equipped with an inbuilt proximity sensor and UV light  it can sense when the user’s hand is near an object and automatically disinfects the object via UV light and alcohol-based spray ” he said. “The band is computer-controlled and can be operated via an app. Further more  it is refillable — when the spray is nearing empty  a reminder is sent on your mobile... I have named it Abhay which means00 fearless” Mukherjee said. Implementing lessons from their robotics class ‘RoboChamps’  two brothers from Haryana’s Ambala have come up with a portable ventilator made of wood which is uniquely designed keeping in mind the importance of social distancing between medical staff and COVID-19 patients. “We have created a wooden structure in which the ball is fixed between two walls. When pushed  the ball gets pumped. The whole structure is fixed with a motor that moves automatically with the time set which is required to pump that ball and this whole circuit is programmed in a way that it works automatically ” said class 8 student Kartik Tara. “This ventilator is connected to a circuit and interfaced with a mobile app so that patients’ health can be monitored closely through the mobile app ” he added. His younger brother Vinayak Tara  who studies in class 4 said  “The protoype has been tested in the city hospital and we are seeking suggestions from medical experts to make the prototype commercially viable”.  The duo has also developed sunglasses which can help maintain a fixed distance between people at public places.  “These sunglasses are integrated with IR sensors in which a code is set for a particular distance. IR detectors are little microchips with a photocell that are tuned to react to infrared light. If someone comes closer than one metre the sunglasses will start beeping. It can also be modified to play music or voice message like ‘please maintain some distance ” 8-year-old Vinayak Tara said.  Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16  when centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Later  a nationwide lockdown was imposed from March 25  which was extended till May 17.  The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 2 649 and the number of cases climbed to 81 970 on Friday  registering an increase of 100 deaths and 3 967 cases in the last 24 hours since Thursday 8 AM  according to the Union Health Ministry.

14/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,How to talk to your kids about the coronavirus,Many schools have been shut in many parts of the world to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). New data suggests that although children are less likely to get sick from COVID19  they still can spread the disease other vulnerable groups.,Many schools have been shut in many parts of the world to contain the spread of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). New data suggests that although children are less likely to get sick from COVID19  they still can spread the disease other vulnerable groups. As public awareness and conversations around Corona Virus increase  kids may worry about themselves  their family members & friends getting sick with COVID19. Parents  family members  teachers  healthcare professionals and the trusted adults play a significant role in helping kids make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest  accurate and minimise their fear or anxiety.  General principles while talking to kids regarding Coronavirus  Stay calm and reassuring.  Remember that kids will react to both what you say and how you say it !  Kids will pick up cues from the conversations you have with them and with others.  Patiently listen to what they say and allow them to ask questions  Avoid using words that might blame others and lead to stigma.  Remember that these viruses can make anyone sick. Avoid making assumptions about who might have COVID-19.  Pay attention to what kids see or hear on television  radio  or online.  Reduce the amount of screen time for kids focused on COVID-19. Too much information on any one topic can lead to anxiety & worry.  Provide information to kids that is honest and accurate.  Give kids information that is truthful and appropriate for the age and developmental level of the child.  Talk to kids about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media may be based on rumours and inaccurate information.  Teach kids everyday actions to reduce the spread of germs.  Teach Do’s and Dont’s at home  schools & play areas.  Do’s  Stay 6 feet away from people who are coughing or sneezing or sick.  Cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow & then throw the tissue into the closed bin.  To wash hands with soap & water for at least 20 seconds  especially after blowing their nose  coughing  or sneezing; after using restroom ; and before eating or preparing food.  If soap and water are not available  teach them to use hand sanitizer.  Dont’s  Avoid touching mouth  nose  eyes and face with unclean hands.  Avoid coughing or sneezing into hands.  Avoid crowded places.  Avoid touching surfaces in public places & play areas unnecessarily.  Points for discussions with kids about COVID-19.  Keep information simple and reassure them that health and school authorities are working very hard to keep everyone safe and healthy.  What is COVID-19 ?  COVID-19 is the short name for “coronavirus disease 2019.”  It is a new virus. Doctors are still learning more about it.  Recently  this virus has made a lot of people sick. Doctors & sciontists think that most people will be ok  especially kids  but some people might get pretty sick.  Doctors and experts are working hard to help people stay healthy.  What can I do so that I don’t get COVID19?  You can practice healthy habits at home  school  and play to help protect against the spread of COVID19:  Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. If you sneeze or cough into a tissue  throw it in the dustbin right away.  Keep your hands out of your mouth  nose  and eyes. This will help keep germs out of your body.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you don’t have soap and water  use hand sanitiser to clean the germs.  Keep things clean.  If you have cough & fever   stay home. Just like you don’t want to get other people’s germs in your body  other people don’t want to get your germs either.  If you are old enough you can help adults at home and school clean the things we touch the most  like desks  doorknobs  light switches  and remote controls. What happens if I get sick with COVID-19?  COVID-19 can look different in different people. From what doctors have seen so far  most kids don’t seem to get very sick. Being sick with COVID19 would be a little bit like having the flu -kids may get a fever  cough  or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.  If you suspect your child may have COVID-19  call govt of India helpline +91-11-23978046 or contact nearest healthcare facility to let them know before you bring your child in to see them.

14/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Fighting the good fight,Domex  Hindustan Unilever Limited’s brand  has declared a war against the virus by supporting disinfection of public facilities across Maharashtra.,Ever since the recent pandemic hit the world  governments and health experts can’t emphasize enough on the merits of social distancing and personal hygiene to flatten the curve. From washing hands for 20 seconds to using alcohol-based sanitizers  these preventive measures are critical.  But while personal hygiene is of utmost importance  it is equally crucial to keep our surroundings clean. While most of us stay indoors  the frontline workers are tirelessly working against the virus. Whether in hospitals  quarantine facilities  or emerging hotspots  supporting them with disinfection of their work environment is the need of the hour.  Currently  leading health organisations recommend the use of bleach-based products with Sodium hypochlorite at >0.5% for disinfection of frequently-touched surfaces. They also recommend cleaning all surfaces in a quarantined person’s room at regular intervals  as well as disinfecting toilets daily. With sodium hypochlorite as an active disinfectant  the Domex floor cleaner  sufficiently satisfies the recommendation of >0.5% sodium hypochlorite for killing germs including viruses. Supporting frontline workers all the way Domex  Hindustan Unilever’s toilet and floor cleaning brand  is working relentlessly to keep hospitals  quarantine centres  homes and public spaces safe. 17 Healthcare facilities and 500+ public toilets across Maharashtra are being regularly disinfected. Amplifying the brand’s efforts  HUL has donated both surface and toilet cleaning products across many hospitals in Mumbai in association with the NGO United Way Mumbai. Keeping homes safe and secure Personal hygiene is about washing and sanitizing hands and it includes keeping your home clean and safe. Domex is a true hero when it comes to protecting us in our fight against viruses. Here is what you can do to prevent infection from spreading:  ●Put the toilet lid down and then step back to flush it  ●Clean all high-touch surfaces with good household cleaners such as Domex Disinfectant Spray ●Let the disinfectant stay to dry naturally. ●Be sure to follow the on-pack instructions for the cleaning products.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/brand-stories/fighting-the-good-fight/story-nCymQQK7hscAvyvrkajKbI.html
13/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Single screens in the Capital: How are they holding up in the Covid-19 crisis?,Owners of popular single screen theatres like Liberty and Delite say that though the financial situation is currently under control  the uncertainty is adding to the stress of no business for the past almost two months.,Like any other business  the movie making and theatre going experience has been impacted massively due to the Covid-19 crisis. Due the lockdown  while multiplexes certainly have to pay rent for the premises they’re running in such as malls or commercial complexes  the single screen theatres too  are waiting for normalcy to resume. Trade expert Atul Mohan tells us that the single screens are at risk because they haven’t had any revenue coming in. “They’re dependent on a good film  if one works well  their next one-two weeks go by easy. They’re able to pay salaries and bills if even one film works in a month ” he says  adding that next  they’ve to pay distributors and producers money to get films. “Say if they pay two-three lakh rupees for one film  they need to make at least five lakhs in business  which doesn’t happen usually. They’re able to make only around two lakhs per week ” he explains. USE THEATRES FOR OTHER PURPOSES Liberty cinema  located in Karol Bagh  has been running for more than five decades now. Owner Rajan Gupta tells us that though the financial situation is currently under control  the uncertainty is adding to the stress of no business for the past one-and-a-half months now.  “We are actually clueless ” he confesses  “Apart from measures like temperature check we might have to take in future  we’re dependent on the comfort of the customers  when they’ll feel comfortable going to a public place. Then the person who makes a film wouldn’t want to release if there’s not enough comfort with the audience. It’s a vicious cycle. If this becomes a long thing  the government should allow us to use our properties for something else which is acceptable  so we are able to survive. Without any physical changes  like as a grocery store. There are also manufacturers who are unable to send their things abroad  the cinema could be the place for selling it  thus helping the industry.” Currently  they’re being able to pay their staff  and things are on track. Gupta adds  “Personally  I have no loans or rents. Over the years  I’ve found that when you think positive of your staff  they think positive of you. They understand the problems we’re facing  and there’s no single cent coming into the business.” MAINTENANCE WORK GOES ON Another popular single screen cinema in Delhi  Delite  has started planning for the future. Manager Rajkumar Malhotra informs us that as of now  they’re being able to sustain their staff only because it’s just been close to two months. “When the lockdown started  the first thing we did was getting work like dry cleaning  renovation done. We expected it to last 10-15 days  not months. I don’t think films will start releasing anytime soon ” he tells us. Emphasising on how things are manageable for them financially  he further says their staff has been paid their full salary. “We even have a maintenance staff stationed at the theatre. We’ve made arrangement for their food too there itself ” Malhotra says. GOVERNMENT HELP Gupta says that the biggest help would be if there was some relief in the electricity bills they get. “As far as maintenance cost is concerned  50% of our electricity bills are made up of fixed costs  which they should not be charging. We’re actually also not able to access our staff  we’ve transferred some funds to them. Just because we’re unable to operate the office  they shouldn’t be without cash. There’s also a view that 75% of their salaries due should be paid by Employees State Insurance  whether government admits or not  it’s a legal point that can’t be taken up at this stage ” he says  adding this pandemic is as “good as falling sick”. Film distributor Joginder Mahajan  also the general secretary of the Motion Pictures Association in Delhi  Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand  adds the point about property tax single screens have to pay. “It’s approximately Rs 50 000 per month. Then there’s a minimum electricity bill  and the permanent staff they have to pay. 20 percent revenue is the distributor’s share. Single screens ka survival mushkil ho gaya hai.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/single-screens-in-the-capital-how-are-they-holding-up-in-the-covid-19-crisis/story-nPWp4SSoGx7ywZg0vaZ8vI.html

Though it has affected my lifestyle and work just like everybody else’s  there are no complaints ” he says  feeling relieved and grateful that “there isn’t an immediate (Covid-19) case in and around my friends  family and loved ones”.  Happy earth day! 🌍 . . Nurture nature... 🍃 🍂 It’s our only home 🏡 . . PS nature and my love affair with dogs  is a thing...🐶 #JustRealised #Nature #earthday A post shared by  rithvik D (@rithvik_d) on Apr 22  2020 at 8:31am PDT Expressing gratitude for all the people who continue to work for everyone’s safety amid the pandemic  Dhanjani says  “It isn’t easy for the ones working in pharmacies  grocery stores  the health care professionals and police officers. Some of them have been attacked and also subjected to corona-shaming. My friend (Meiyang Chang)  who is Indian Chinese  was also corona-shamed when two passers-by called ‘coronavirus’. That shows how shallow we still are as a society.” He further points out how those who are tested positive for Covid-19 have to deal with the stigma that prevails. “They are being put through this fight not just against the virus but corona-shaming as well  where people can’t be sensitive in times like these.” The need of the hour  he asserts is to be “kinder and compassionate” not just towards each other but for nature as well. “We’ve exploited our nature on a regular basis without imagining its repercussions. This is a big reminder to become what we should have become a long time ago — more considerate towards people  our nature  and the ecosystem. We’re not the only ones living on this planet  there are more living beings and we need to respect that.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/rithvik-dhanjani-corona-shaming-shows-how-shallow-we-are-as-a-society/story-HwPgdKcRdvBfqsslCyKYaM.html

12/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,PM Modi announces stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore for Covid-hit economy. Read full speech text here,Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the coronavirus pandemic has presented India with an opportunity to become self-reliant and to emerge as the best across the world.,Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore and a slew of financial incentives to revive Indian economy which is currently staring at the onslaught of coronavirus pandemic. The financial package  prime minister announced  will be around 10 per cent of the country’s GDP and will play an important role in India’s self-reliance campaign.  The prime minister said the coronavirus crisis has presented India with an opportunity to become self-reliant and to emerge as the best across the world. Here’s the full text of the prime minister’s speech: Greetings to fellow citizens  for over four months the global community has been in the fight against Corona virus. During this period more than 42 lakh people across the world have been infected with Corona. More than 2.75 Lakh people have died tragically. In India too  people have lost their near and dear ones.I express my heartfelt condolences to all. Friends  a virus has destroyed the world. Crores of people around the world are facing a crisis. World all over is engaged in a battle to save precious lives. We have never seen or heard of such a crisis.This crisis is unthinkable as well as unprecedented for mankind. However-getting exasperated  losing heart or getting shattered  is not acceptable to the mankind. We have to remain vigilant  closely monitor it  follow the rules of engagement in such a war  save ourselves and move ahead.Today  when the world is in crisis  we must strengthen our resolve. Our great resolve will help overcome this crisis. Also read: Behind Rs 20 lakh crore package  PM Modi’s hard push for self reliance Friends  we have been hearing since the last century that the 21st century belongs to India. We have seen how the world was before Corona and the global systems in detail. Even after the infliction of the Corona crisis  we are constantly watching the situation as it unfolds across the globe. When we look at these two periods from India’s perspective  it seems that the 21st century is the century for India. This is not our dream  rather a responsibility for all of us. But what should be its trajectory? The state of the world today teaches us that a (AtmaNirbhar Bharat) “Self-reliant India” is the only path .It is said in our scriptures - EshahPanthahThat is - self-sufficient India. Friends  As a nation today we stand at a very crucial juncture. Such a big disaster is a signal for India it has brought a message and an opportunity.I will share my perspective with an example. When the Corona crisis started  there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produced in small quantity in India. Today we are in a situation to produce 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily. We were able to do this because India turned this crisis into an opportunity. This vision of India - turning crisis into opportunity- is going to prove equally effective for our resolve of self-reliant India. Friends  Today the meaning of the word self-reliance has changed in the global scenario. The debate on Human Centric Globalization versus Economy Centralized Globalization is on. India’s fundamental thinking provides a ray of hope to world. The culture and tradition of India speaks of self-reliance and the soul is VasudhaivaKutumbakam. India does not advocate self-centric arrangements when it comes to self-reliance. India’s self-reliance is ingrained in the happiness  cooperation and peace of the world. This is the culture which believes in the welfare of the world  for all the living creatures and the one which considers the whole world as a family. Its premise is ‘माता भूमिः पुत्रो अहम् पृथिव्यः’ - the culture that considers the earth to be the mother. And when the Bharat Bhumi  becomes self-sufficient  it ensures the possibility of a prosperous world. India’s progress has always been integral to the progress of the world. India’s goals and actions impact the global welfare. When India is free from open defecation it has an impact on the image of the world. Be it TB  malnutrition  polio  India’s campaigns have influenced the world. International Solar Alliance is India’s gift against Global Warming. The initiative of International Yoga Day is India’s gift to relieve stress. Indian medicines have given a fresh lease of life to the people in different parts of the world. These steps have brought laurels for India and it makes every Indian feel proud. The world is beginning to believe that India can do very well  so much good for the welfare of mankind can give. The question is - how? The answer to this question is – A Combined resolve of 130 crore citizens for a self-reliant India. Friends  We have a proud history of centuries. When India was prosperous  it was called the golden goose  it was prosperous  and then it always walked tall for the welfare of the world.  Then the times changed  the country was caught in the chains of slavery  we longed for development. Today  when India is making rapid strides in its progress  it is still committed to the goal of global welfare. Remember  the Y2K crisis at the beginning of this century. Technology experts from India pulled the world out of that crisis. Today we have the resources  we have the power  and we have the best talent in the world. We will make the best products  will improve our quality further  make the supply chain more modern  we can do this and we will definitely do it. Friends  I had witnessed the Kutch earthquake. There was debris everywhere. Everything was destroyed. It seemed as if Kutch had fallen asleep wearing a sheet of death. In that situation no one could have imagined that the situation would ever change. However  Kutch stood up  Kutch started moving  Kutch moved. This is the grit and determination of weIndians. If we are determined then we can reach our goals and no path will be difficult. And today there is a will and there is a way. That is to make India self-reliant. Our combined resolve is so strong that India can become self-sufficient. Friends  this magnificent building of self-reliant India will stand on five Pillars. First Pillar is Economy  an economy that brings Quantum Jump rather than Incremental change. Second Pillar is Infrastructure  an infrastructure that became the identity of modern India. Third Pillar is Our System. A system that is driven by technology which canfulfill the dreams of the 21st century; a system not based on the policy of the past century. Fourth Pillar is Our Demography. Our Vibrant Demography is our strength in the world’s largest democracy  our source of energy for self-reliant India. The fifth pillar is Demand. The cycle of demand and supply chain in our economy  is the strength that needs to be harnessed to its full potential. In order to increase demand in the country and to meet this demand  every stake-holder in our supply chain needs to be empowered. We will strengthen our supply chain  our supply system built up with the smell of the soil and the sweat of our labourers. Friends  amidst the Corona crisis  I am announcing today a special economic package with a new resolution. This economic package will serve as an important link in the ‘AtmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” (Self Reliant India Campaign)’. Friends  in the recent past economic announcements made by the government related to the Corona crisis  which were the decisions of the Reserve Bank. The economic package that is being announced today  if added  comes to around Rs. 20 lakh crores. This package is about 10 percent of India’s GDP. With this various sections of the country and those linked to economic system will get support and strength of 20 lakh crore rupees. This package will give a new impetus to the development journey of the country in 2020 and a new direction to the Self-reliant India campaign. In order to prove the resolve of a self-reliant India  Land  Labor  Liquidity and Laws all have been emphasized in this package. This economic package is for our cottage industry  home industry  our small-scale industry  our MSME  which is a source of livelihood for millions of people  which is the strong foundation of our resolve for a self-reliant India. This economic package is for that labourer of the country  for the farmers of the country who are working day and night for the countrymen in every situation  every season. This economic package is for the middle class of our country  which pays taxes honestly and contributes to the development of the country. This economic package is for Indian industries  which are determined to give a boost to the economic potential of India. Starting tomorrow  over the next few days  the Finance Minister will give you detailed information about this economic package inspired by the ‘Self-reliant India campaign’. Friends  it is now imperative for the country to move forward with the commitment of Bold Reforms to create a self-reliant India. You have also experienced that as a result of the reforms over the past 6 years  today even in this time of crisis; India’s systems have looked more efficient. Otherwise  who could have thought that the money sent by Government of India will reach directly in the pocket of the poor farmer! But it has happened. That also happened when all the government offices were closed; the means of transport were shut down.This was just a reform related to Janadhan-Aadhaar-Mobile-JAM’s Trishakti  the effect of which we have just seen. Now the scope of the reforms has to be broadened  giving a new height. These reforms will be in the entire supply chain related to farming  so that the farmer is also empowered and will have minimal impact on agriculture in any other crisis like corona in future. These reforms will be for  rational tax system  simple and clear rules-of-law  good infrastructure  capable and competent human resources  and building strong financial system. These reforms will encourage business  attract investment and strengthen our resolve for Make in India. Friends  self-reliance is possible only through inner strength and self-belief. Self-reliance also prepares the country for a tough competition in the global supply chain. And today it is the need of the hour that India should play a big role in the global supply chain. Realizing this  many provisions have also been made in the economic package. This will increase the efficiency of all our sectors and also ensure quality. Friends  this crisis is so big  that the biggest systems have been shaken. However  under these circumstances  the country has also seen the resolve and restraint of our poor brothers and sisters  especially the street vendors  hawkers  labourers  those who are working in homes  they have done a lot of penance during this time  they have sacrificed a lot. Who would not have realized their absence? Now it is our duty to make them strong  to take some big steps for their financial requirements. Keeping this in mind  be it poor  labourers  migrant labourers  cattle rearers  be our fishermen  organized sector or unorganized sector  some important decisions will be announced in the economic package for every section. Friends  the Corona crisis has also explained to us the importance of Local manufacturing  Local market and Local supply chain. In times of crisis  this Local has fulfilled our demand  this Local has saved us. Local is not just the need  it is our responsibility also. Time has taught us that we must make the Local as a mantra of our life. The Global Brands you feel today were sometimes also very local like this. But when people started using them  started promoting them  branding them  proud of them  they became Global from Local Products. Therefore  from today every Indian has to become vocal for their local  not only to buy local products  but also to promote them proudly. I am confident that our country can do this. Your efforts have increased my reverence for you every time. I recollect one thing with pride. When I requested you and the nation to buyKhadi and said it will be a great support to our handloom workers. Today  the demand and sales of both Khadi and handloom have reached record levels in a very short time. Not only that  you also made it a big brand. It was a very small effort  but the result was very good. Friends  experts and scientists have pointed out that Corona will remain a part of our lives for a long time. But at the same time  we cannot allow this to happen that our lives will be confined only around the corona. We would wear masks  follow two yards distance and pursue our goals. Therefore  the fourth phase of lockdown  lockdown 4  will be completely redesigned  with new rules. Based on the suggestions we are getting from the states  information related to Lockdown 4 will also be given to you before 18 May. I am confident that by following the rules  we will fight Corona and move forward. Friends  In our culture  it is said ‘सर्वम् आत्म वशं सुखम्’ i.e. what is in our control  is happiness. Self-reliance leads to happiness  satisfaction and empowerment. Our responsibility to make the 21st century  the century of India  will be fulfilled by the pledge of self-reliant India. This responsibility will only get energy from the life force of 130 crore citizens. This era of self-reliant India will be a new vow for every Indian as well as a new festival. Now we have to move forward with a new resolve and determination. When ethics are filled with duty  the culmination of diligence  the capital of skills  then who can stop India from becoming self-reliant? We can make India a self-reliant nation. We will make India self-reliant. With this resolve  with this belief  I wish you the very best.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-announces-stimulus-package-of-rs-20-lakh-crore-for-covid-hit-economy-read-full-speech-text-here/story-O8xdL3lYLUGjKUSurdHvsJ.html

And hence  he says the lockdown has been like “just another day” for him. Speaking from Mumbai  he tells us  “I’m alone right now  with just a cook  so I’m glad my food is sorted. My parents live in Delhi. I’m not doing anything different  and it’s like how others are keeping themselves busy. Even in the normal times  when I didn’t have work  I’d always be at home. The only difference is none of the friends who would visit  can come now.” The 33-year-old had returned from Spain on March 6  when the Covid-19 pandemic has just started to take over in India. Wahi says he had to go through a full check-up at the airport  and was told to report if he felt any symptoms.   🙏🏻 Don't know how to pass your time during quarantine??

A few of my projects have been affected. I had something on the acting front  that’s delayed indefinitely now ” he continues  “Then I was producing a new show  that’s also on hold now. We are actually using the time to write it better  than feel sad about the fact that it’s not going to go on floors right now. It’ll definitely take a hit.” A new project starring Wahi with actor Lara Dutta  recently went live. Happy with the response  he tells us that the cast and crew had to complete the post-production from their homes  complete with the dubbing  just to meet the release date deadline.  “There were a lot of hardships for the makers  the editing  colour correction and dubbing. We had no option but to do that from homes ” he says  adding  “Makers wanted to come out at this time (lockdown). What might just happen after this period is over is that most of the people wouldn’t want to sit at home. It was a good way  through which people will watch it at least  that’s our aim.

People are trying to do their bit by giving money and food. But everyone has limited liquid money in hand.

Irrfan  54  passed away on April 29 after a prolonged battle with cancer. Papon shared a video in which Irrfan lauds the singer’s talent and  wishes he sings for all his films. “I knew him since our Delhi days  around 2002-2003. He’d often come to my house. After he shifted to Mumbai  we were in touch through calls. When I came to Mumbai  we’d often bump into each other. Things were good till he fell ill. We were in touch and he’d ask for song recommendations while undergoing his treatment in London ” recalls Papon  who collaborated with Irrfan in Qarib Qarib Singlle (2017) and Karwaan (2018). Didn’t even know he had said this! Shattered! 💔 https://t.co/WFtLB4Xvy9 All praises for the Hindi Medium actor  Papon further says  “Jo log sau saal mein nahi kar paate  unhone pachaas saal mein kar diya  aur pata hi nahi chala. The entire world mourned his loss. When I had met him first  he was vulnerable and inquisitive. Two decades later  he was still the same. He never changed ” says Papon  who is trying to remain positive during these trying times. Highlighting the power of the mind during such a phase and amid the Covid-19 times pandemic  Papon is trying to focus on doing more than just creating new songs. The singer-songwriter-composer is organising online concerts and collaborations  to raise funds and generate work.  “It’s not easy to stop negative thoughts from coming to us. But  how we ignore them and focus on positives is in our hands ” he says. When it comes to work  Paponis also stressed like many others  but he swears by what his latest Assamese song  Paar hobo ei xomoi  indicates — this time too shall pass.  The forced distance got us closer and finally our first impromptu jam happened online. With my dear brother from another mother  @danielcasares_guitarra   one of the most soulful Spanish Guitar Player I’ve even met. We know each other since we met in Dhaka and have been hoping to make music till he called me a few days back and we did this impromptu jam over the internet. Hope you all like it. ❤️ A post shared by  Papon (@paponmusic) on May 5  2020 at 9:31am PDT “When I work on my new songs  or when I do collaborations and concerts  it makes me very happy. Fans say my efforts have pepped up their mood. I think when people see me smiling  they see hope ” adds the 44-year-old  who has recreated his old song Din guzrein. He shot the music videos for both this song and the Assamese single at home. Meanwhile  amid lockdown  Papon is enjoying time with family. “My children (Puhor  10  and Parijaat  8) have learnt how to do household chores. They understand the situation and don’t make illogical demands. The other day my daughter made me tea. The best thing is that they’re learning the piano so quickly. I feel so proud ” he shares.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/music/papon-recalls-his-first-meeting-with-irrfan-he-was-inquisitive-vulnerable-and-two-decades-later-he-was-still-the-same/story-OubHFYvmeEEYsgRZ7gb2tL.html

The health officials claim that at least 64 of the total 260 Covid-19 cases in the district are of those associated with supply chain and their numbers are still rising.  The infected people are mainly fruit and vegetable vendors  grocery shop owners and those working in dairies and medicine shops.  The first corona case among supply chain people was of a fruit vendor in Naveen Mandi of T P Nagar area in first week of May. He later died during treatment in a Delhi hospital. District surveillance officer Dr Vishwas Choudhary admitted that infection in people associated with supply chain is a matter of great concern.  Citing example of positive cases in Ravindrapuri of Sadar area here  he said “Twenty-two members of a family got infected after coming in contact with the fruit seller who later died during treatment.”  Moe than two dozen Covid-19 cases have been detected in Ravindrapuri alone so far. Dr Chowdhary said pool tests were conducted in Mandi and many vendors  shopkeepers and those who came in their contacts had tested positive and their numbers were still growing.  A vegetable vendor in Hastinapur and an employee in a medical shop in Daurala area were also found positive along with a constable of Lisari gate police station on Monday.  “We are keeping a close watch on testing of samples those associated with supply chain and making them aware of following social distancing and also asking them to use masks at their workplace ” Dr Choudhary said.  Taking note of the situation  the district administration has shifted retail vegetable market to two locations on the outskirts of the city where shopkeepers are observing social distancing. Shopkeepers and vendors have also been asked to frequently use sanitiser  wear masks and follow other lockdown norms to protect themselves from the deadly virus. So far  14 people have died of corona in the district.  Dr Tanuraj Sirohi  former president  Indian Medical Association’s Meerut unit  said tracing contacts of people in supply chain was a tedious task because they dealt with a number of people everyday.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/growing-covid-19-cases-among-supply-chain-people-a-big-worry-in-meerut/story-I1jVsCbJFyPORaiHtM8GXL.html

Films and web also intrigue me. Medium can never be a barrier. It’s just that I can’t do an infinite show on TV  given my other commitments ” he shares. During the lockdown  Choudhary and his wife are bonding over little joys. “She gets upset every time I end up sleeping while watching a series/ film that I only recommended ” he laughs  and adds  “Her parents are with us.

11/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,‘Allow economic activity in all of Delhi except containment zones’: Kejriwal to PM Modi,The chief minister made the comments during a meeting with the PM   along with other CMs  to discuss the lockdown situation in the country.,Reiterating his earlier stand about reopening Delhi  chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to allow economic activities in all areas except the containment zones. “Economic activities should be allowed to resume in all parts of Delhi except containment zones ” ANI quoted the CM as saying during the online meeting with the PM  along with other CMs  to discuss the restarting of trade activities and the lockdown situation. The nationwide lockdown  which is in its last week  is in place till May 17. Last week  Kejriwal  in a philosophical vein  said one will have to “learn to live with coronavirus”  adding it is time to “reopen Delhi”. The lockdown was earlier scheduled to be lifted on May 3. The chief minister said coronavirus is going nowhere and it is impossible that cases of coronavirus will be zero. “Corona(virus) has come. It is impossible that there will be no cases of coronavirus because it has not happened across the country ” the CM said then. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan shot down his proposal of reopening Delhi. “It would not be right for me to comment as it will be seen as a political statement. On a personal level  I think a lot needs to be done to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In this lockdown 3  I think that minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government. But this decision has to be taken by the state. Guidelines have been issued by the home ministry but the states are free to decide ” the minister told reporters last week. Highlighting the adverse impact of coronavirus on the exchequer  Kejriwal said in April 2019  the government earned Rs 3 500 crore while in April this year  it only received Rs 300 crore.

11/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Here is some good advice for good breathing!,In view of the effect of respiratory viruses on asthma  it is of paramount importance that asthmatics take utmost care in the current times.,Mumbai  Maharashtra  India: Business Wire India •How should asthmatic take care during current times Chronic respiratory conditions accounts for a massive health burden in India. According to Global Burden Disease Report  “In India  around 93 million people suffer from chronic respiratory; out of this  around 37 million are Asthmatics. India contributes to only 11.1% of the global asthma burden  it accounts for over 42% of all global asthma deaths making it the asthma capital of the world.” Respiratory viral infections are the primary cause of asthma exacerbations. For patients at risk of asthma  or with existing asthma  viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound effect on the expression of disease or loss of control. It is important to know that currently there is no evidence of increased infection rates in those with asthma. However  there are estimation  which states that patients with moderate-severe asthma could be at greater risk for more severe disease  but there are no published data to support this. In view of the effect of respiratory viruses on asthma it is of paramount importance that asthmatics take utmost care in the current times. In order to completely stop/prevent virus-induced exacerbations from occurring  good asthma management would be critical to implement. Doctors across India consistently urge asthmatics to take extra care of themselves in current situation. Below are the FAQs: 1.Is it advisable for asthmatics to continue using their corticosteroid inhaler? Dr Parthasarathi Bhattacharyya  MD(Medicine)  DNBE  DM (Pulmonary Medicine). Institute of Pulmocare and Research  Kolkata said  “Stopping steroid inhaler will put the person at risk for developing an asthma exacerbation. In the current pandemic  treatment of an exacerbation will likely require going to the emergency department or urgent care  where the individual has a much higher risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. So  it is always advisable to a patient of asthma not to go to anywhere that increases the chance of exposure to viral infections.” Dr C Vijay Kumar  Pulmonologist  Apollo Hospitals  Jublihills  Hyderabad said  “Patients with asthma should never stop taking their corticosteroid inhaler unless asked to do so by a medical professional. Stopping the steroid inhaler could put the patient at higher risk of complications with infections as it would impair asthma control. People with asthma are placed on steroid inhalers to keep their asthma under control. In the current pandemic  the best thing a person with asthma can do (with respect to asthma) is to get and keep their asthma under control.” 2.What should be done to ensure that the inhaler does not get infected? What should an asthmatic do if he experiences worsening of his symptoms? Dr Rajeev Paliwal  HOD  Chest Department  Shree Krishna Hospital & Pramukhswami Medical College  Karamsad mentioned  “Never share inhalers with others. Wash the inhalation devices regularly to keep them hygienic and clean. Asthmatics should follow the Asthma Action Plan as recommended by their Doctor. If he doesn’t have one  ask the doctor. It is recommended to use an MDI with a Spacer to relieve acute symptoms.” Dr S K Jindal  Director  Jindal Clinics  Chandigarh and Former Professor & Head  Pulmonary Medicine  at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research  Chandigarh added  “Use of Nebulisers should be avoided as they carry a high risk of transmitting viral infections because they generate aerosols that can spread infectious droplets for several metres. However  there could be situations when a nebulizer is absolutely required. In such it is of utmost importance to follow Good Nebulization and Infection control practices. Your doctor can advise you on these practices to be followed.” 3.Should asthmatics go ahead with scheduled appointments or should they avoid going to medical centres or hospitals? Dr Suryakant Tripathi  Prof and Head of Dept - Respiratory Medicine  KGMU  Lucknow and President  Indian College of Allergy Asthma and Applied Immunology said  “If the asthma is under control avoid visiting to a clinic of a hospital. You may want to contact your doctor telephonically and update him about your progress. If it is absolutely necessary for you to visit the doctor please take a prior appointment and visit him. Asthmatics should avoid making any unscheduled visits to the clinic.” 4.What should people with asthma do if they have symptoms of fever and cough? Dr Rajesh Swarnakar  National Secretary  Indian Chest Society  Director & Chief Consultant Pulmonologist  Getwell Hospital & Research Institute  Dhantoli  NAGPUR mentioned  “Though asthma is associated is with cough and breathlessness  fever is unusual. In such a situation asthmatic  must immediately consult the doctor and follow all instructions given. It is important to continue taking your controller medications and do not stop them. In the current situation  the best thing a person with asthma can do is to get and keep their asthma under control. Stopping a controller medication will put the person at risk for developing an asthma exacerbation—especially as we enter spring allergy season. In the current pandemic  treatment of an exacerbation will likely require going to the emergency department or urgent care  where the individual has a much higher risk of being exposed to infections.” Dr Parthasarathi Bhattacharyya  MD(Medicine)  DNBE  DM (Pulmonary Medicine). Institute of Pulmocare and Research  Kolkata further shared the list of advice for asthmatic: a.Do not panic  I often get phone calls from people with sneezing. They think that it could be corona virus infection. No  the chance is less if you have no fever and if you have not exposed yourselves to corona virus infected patients. I recommend people to try any antihistaminic tablet for a few days. If it gives relief in a day or two  it is most likely allergic rhinitis and not the Co-V infection. b.Use your medications regularly and properly. c.If you have asthma symptoms or need of extra SOS inhaler-use  please discuss it with your doctor on telephone  try to get some help or go with teleconsultation. d.Avoid using nebulization: it has to be only when everything fails. To my experience and  of course scientifically too  nebulization is not essential and meter dose inhalers with spacers can do as good as nebulizers. Some people feel happy with nebulizers; it is mostly psychological to me. I hardly treat my patients with nebulization. In COVID time it increases the risk of contamination and spread of the virus. e.Try to avoid the precipitants: This is very important. Most of our patients know the situations that precipitate their attacks. Lucky that we are in summer days now; avoid cold drinks  ice cream  smoke  dust  etc. f.Try to remain at the best of your health. Please think that for now and also for no point of time you can afford to have an attack or exacerbation. Hence  be meticulous in using medications. Remember that observing the technique in the best possible fashion is most important in inhalation therapy. Please give attention to it. A lot of teaching material is available in the internet and elsewhere  Do use them. Someone in the household van take the charge of the elderly member of the family to assist him or her personally to use spacer properly. g.Do not try any experimental therapy now.

We are fighting together against Corona[virus]  but this cannot be an excuse to trample human rights  allow unsafe workplaces  exploit workers and suppress their voices. We cannot compromise on the basic principles [protecting the rights of workers] ” tweeted the Congress leader in Hindi.

Also Watch | ‘Deposit Rs 7 500 in poor people’s accounts immediately’: Rahul Gandhi The BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh  two states with substantial workforces  have frozen major labour laws  except basic ones  in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis. The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees  determining their wages  and reduce their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits.  Some economists welcomed the move for clearing structural bottlenecks  possibly leading to greater investment  creating employment opportunities for migrant workers returning home  and positioning India to be able to take advantage of disruptions in global supply chains. The move  however  also sparked intense criticism from the Opposition  particularly left parties  trade unions including those affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  and civil society activists for undermining worker rights  removing decades-old protective measures and slowly dismantle the welfare architecture.

She urges that in times like these  people need to step out and unite for the larger good.  Waste Warriors clean up the mountains in Dharamshala  Himachal. they manage the waste around the Corbett Tiger reserve and work with the government in Dehradun to keep our Himalayas clean and sustainable. It has a network of 700-800 waste pickers families who are the foot soldiers in this fight and the lockdown has made their already difficult life very unbearable. More than 10 000 kgs of ration already have been provided to put food on the table of more than 3500 people. Join me to support these unsung heros who make our daily life easier. Link in the bio. I spend a lot of my time in Dharamshala and very often end up meeting people like @avinashp.singh (from waste warriors)  who do everything they can to give back to the community. It is very inspiring to see that even in such hard times people are holding each others back. A post shared by  Fatima Sana Shaikh (@fatimasanashaikh) on Apr 15  2020 at 4:38am PDT The actor is also harnessing the power of social media to spread awareness about raising help for not just daily wage workers in the film industry  but also for a group called Waste Warriors  which is an NGO for people who clean up the mountains in Dharamsala  Himachal. Shaikh notes how “the lockdown has made their already difficult life very unbearable”  and that the post garnered a good response  couldn’t have made her happier. “It’s a very tough time and a lot of people are suffering. During such times  we should come together and do our bit ” adds the actor  who’s spending time with family  besides cooking and cleaning.

After her much successful Dangal (2016)  she took a two-year-gap to do her second film Thugs of Hindostan  which didn’t set the cash registers ringing. It was painful for Shaikh  but she’s all set to come back with Ludo and Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari. However  now due to this crisis  things will take time to roll. But  she’s being patient and looking forward to work. Along and all the way  there have been learnings. Shaikh elaborates  “In Dangal  we weren’t conventional. So I was looking for something different in my next — that would reveal a different side of me as performer rather than the audience seeing me as Geeta (her character in Dangal). At that time  TOH came in like a perfect set-up. That it didn’t work is a different thing altogether. Now  we’re dealing with something like corona. So  from an extreme high to an extreme low  I’ve experienced both these aspects closely quite early on  and honestly  I feel that they’re equally important.” Follow @htshowbiz for more,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/fatima-sana-shaikh-on-covid-19-crisis-it-s-a-very-tough-time-a-lot-of-people-are-suffering/story-r44ItrPT6qOIbSpfMJ3LzI.html

What I remember most are her teachings and wisdom ” confesses Mohan. Actor Renee Dhyani who has been living alone says  “Did you ever think of managing all of that? You can’t think of just one thing.

Talking about involving her seven-year-old in these activities  the actor says  “We don’t have a subject to prepare our children on how to face life. In school  they’re just given professional choices. So  I talk to Samiarra about different things and give her books to read that develop her mind and soul. She’s quite spiritual and inquisitive.” This made Parmar feel even prouder when her daughter recently said her favourite leader is Buddha  favourite sportsperson is Mary Kom and mentioned a bookstore as her favourite destination.

Work and finances also need to be taken care of ” Parmar continues  “Samairra is sensitive. She understands that corona is bad and safety is important. But she’s a little upset because we were supposed to go to the US during summer vacations this year  and it got cancelled. She’s very angry with the virus (laughs).” While maintaining sanity isn’t easy during these trying times  Parmar says it isn’t impossible if one tries. “We all have gone through many difficulties in our lives and overcome them all. I’ve also been through so much. But I realised that it’s important to stay strong and positive. We all make our own choices and  create our destiny ” she says.  Lockdown may limit our resources but its teaching us to make the best out of limited resources!

But this time  we’ll of course have to accept the situation that we can’t step out of the house. But the biggest celebration is that we all are together  healthy and safe. That is what we are thankful about. ” Parmar says with gratitude. So is there anything special planned? “Samairra usually makes things for me  like she makes a card. She’s an emotional child  keeps writing notes to me every now and then. And she doesn’t have to wait for Mother’s Day to make it special for me because she has made my life special by coming into my life  by making me a mother ” adds the actor.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/juhi-parmar-on-mother-s-day-as-a-single-mom-i-need-to-stay-close-to-samairra-and-take-care-of-work-and-finances/story-IqzjW9TFa3gKpq5JdEBRzK.html
10/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman;india,Lucknow woman trudges 900 km to save daughter from Covid-19,The 25 year-old woman is on a 900 km journey to her home in Amethi from Indore on foot  just to save her child from the dreaded corona virus.,Standing beside a deserted highway on the outskirts of the state capital under the scorching May sun  Rukhsana Bano signals a passing truck for a lift. She is carrying a small bag in one hand and holds her three-year old-daughter  Nargis  on her shoulder with the other. The truck speeds away without slowing. The 25 year-old woman is on a 900 km journey to her home in Amethi from Indore on foot  just to save her child from the dreaded corona virus. “My daughter has not eaten since last night. I am worried about her. If we don’t get any vehicle we will continue our journey on foot ” she said  signalling towards a group of eight people (her relatives)  who travelled with her to reach the safety of their home. A native of Jagdishpur in Amethi  Rukhsana and her husband Aqib lived in Indore  Madhya Pradesh. The husband was a waiter at an eatery while Rukhsana worked as domestic help. They managed their expenses with the Rs 9 000 her husband earned and saved the Rs 3000 she earned for the future of their daughter. Rukhsana could not study beyond Class 8 but she wanted to educate Nargis. Then came the pandemic  followed by the lockdown and the couple lost their jobs. Their meagre savings evaporated within days. Rukhsana refused to withdraw a single penny from the money she saved for her daughter. But what worried her more was the rapid spread of Covid-19 in Indore. “Har gali mohalle se coronavirus ki kahabar aane lagi. Pura shahar band kar diya. Hum log ghar me rahe taki Nargis ko corona na ho (People in every ally were infected by Covid-19. The entire city was closed down. We stayed inside our houses to prevent Nargis from getting infected)  “ she said. Indore  known as the business hub of Madhya Pradesh  is one of the worst affected cities by Covid-19 in central India. Some of her relatives decided to walk back home when the lockdown was extended again in April but Nargis decided to stay back  hoping things would improve. But when the lockdown was extended for the third time last week  her patience wore out. “The infection was increasing and I got worried  thinking what will we do if we or our daughter get infected. So I decided to somehow return to our family in Amethi ” she said. But leaving Indore was not easy. Her husband of four years decided to stay and refused to accompany her. Rukhsana tried to persuade him but later decided to head home to save her child from the possibility of infection. She joined a group of relatives returning to Amethi  packed some biscuits  jam and clothes in a bag and left home. The group started walking from Indore on Wednesday night. After a lift on two trucks and a tractor and walking for over 24 hours  they reached Lucknow on Saturday. The journey took a toll on their bodies. All of them had blisters on their feet and looked exhausted and famished. After cleaning their wounds and a brief halt under a thorny bush along the roadside  the group decided to hit the road again. Their frail tired bodies began walking on the road again  Rukhsana with her child in front of the group. She covered Nargis with a piece of cloth as she braved the sun  realising that this journey was only a part of the hardships she would have to face to raise her daughter.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trudging-900-km-to-save-daughter-from-covid-19/story-62QNDDaOkLXRBNXmSkCniK.html

In a freewheeling chat  Hooda  43  talks about looking at the brighter side of the lockdown  relief work he has done for the forest people  the ‘new normal’  his films on hold  and why he won’t give in to the social media temptation. So  how are you making the most of this time at home? Usually  it’s preparing for a role or something but now  I’m doing voice exercises on the harmonium  imagination exercises  going back to the stories I used to do on stage  contemplating on staging a production  and then reading scripts  books  poetry  watching and catching up on shows that I’ve not caught up on because these long shows always seem like a lot of commitment. And I used to start them  but now I’ve gone through some of them and they are just fantastic. Over 40 days into the lockdown... has there been a moment you felt low or lonely and wished all this should just come to an end now? Honestly  now (after extension) it’s getting a bit much  but till now  I’ve been dealing with it well. We collectively have to get through these feelings and help each other  help humanity  the whole planet and our country  so it’s necessary. Once you think about the larger good that (this lockdown) is doing  it takes away a lot of the down feeling that you’re getting.  Finally we are one!! What a happy moment to see everyone ring bells and clap for the people that are tirelessly working at the time of this crisis. I am also doing my bit. #StaySafeStayHome India. Jai hind🙏🏾 #clapforourcarers #5baje5minute #juntacurfew A post shared by  Randeep Hooda (@randeephooda) on Mar 22  2020 at 5:25am PDT Do you miss your family  your parents? How are they doing? My mother and father are quarantining in Faridabad  which is not far from my sister’s house. They’re well  and absolutely isolated as I am. My whole family’s doing fine. They watched my movie (Extraction) without me being there and I was just getting their feedback on phone and they’re very elated. What about not being able to go out for work given all shootings have been stalled until further notice? As far as work goes work  it doesn’t only happen when you’re at your desk or at your job or for me  on my set. There’s a lot of work to do otherwise also  so I’d say  during this time  think of the things that you used to like doing as a child and do that. It’ll bring out more of the child within us and we’ll find wonders in the corners of her house which  we have probably forgotten. Can you already sense what the ‘new normal’ is going to look like once all this is over and we reset our lives? I went to Irrfan’s funeral (April 29); he was buried right next to my house. There I realised that nobody could really hug anybody (pauses)  so that’s the new normal we all have to get used to. We  (Indians) are very affectionate  and physical people. So  the whole thing of looking at the other person and thinking twice about getting in their personal space  is something that’s definitely going to change. Also  we’ll have more individualism in the world  which I feel should enrich the lives. I’m hoping that as a collective  we come out as a better race  a better humankind and a better species that’s more considerate and compassionate.  Gone too soon is the inspiration and the entertainment #IrrfanKhan a great loss to cinema and the craft .. may you rest in peace brother 🙏🏽 A post shared by  Randeep Hooda (@randeephooda) on Apr 29  2020 at 9:36am PDT At such a time  being constantly fed by positivity is also very important. But the amount of negative news we read on Twitter is it worrisome and bogs you down as well? There is a whole world inside Twitter  especially the one that’s arguing about things which are only relevant in the Twitter world. In the real world  nobody really gives a damn. And so many of these issues that they talk about are just conversations and arguments not even healthy argument  they are just finger pointing within the the Twitter world. It is a very negative platform  I mean they’re fighting and squabbling over little things  ideas  little statements  and that’s to much. I ignore that and I look for positivity even there. Also  most actors are all out there on social media giving glimpses into their daily routine. Why don’t we see you post anything about your lockdown tales? You seem to be totally refraining from this temptation... any reason? I don’t know why would I want people to know what I’m doing inside my house? I have absolutely no interest in that. When it’s my work  I like to share pictures and experiences  not what I’m doing  what I’m eating  how I am working out and all... I really have no interest in watching other people do that  so I also do not think my photos would be of any interest to anybody else. So when you see all these cooking  cleaning  working out pictures on the social media  do you get annoyed with the overload? I think it’s the need to reach out to people to feel connected  which is okay in this time. Social media has taken over our lives in a lot of aspects. We are sharing a lot more of our lives  even I am  not to that extent  but still. It’s a way of connecting to people and you feel like  ‘oh  so many people I’ve interacted with my thoughts or what I posted’  so it has got its good and bad. Like in life  you have to look at the good part and forget the other part. But I really feel to each his own. Whether it is their opinion  or what they want to post  absolutely do what you feel like... and if I don’t like it  I can just ignore it.  #TheFriendInNeed pilot campaign at Tadoba  for the Guides and drivers  has been a huge success  thanks to all involved.

Tell us something about that. I’ve contributed my bit to the PM Relief Fund  and for Matheran horses. Also  we did this pilot campaign called #FriendInNeed for Tadoba Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra for this whole lot of forest people — guides  drivers  hotel staff — whose livelihood depends on the forest. Through this project  we are paying directly to the field director of the park. Through a Facebook community page called CLAW (Conservation Lenses & Wildlife)  along with one of my friends  Sarosh Lodhi  we did a census and found 400 families in need. So  local vendors there  with the help of the forest department  are distributing essentials. We kept it completely non photo-op because I’ve seen some terrible photos of one person receiving things from 13 people and we didn’t want that. Are you saying you are against the idea of getting pictures clicked while helping the needy and doing something for a cause? That is becoming a bit of a thing  but I don’t completely knock it out  because as long as your giving  it doesn’t matter. If you want to be known about it  great. I mean  there is nothing wrong with it. As long as the help reaches  whether you want to talk about it or you don’t want to talk about it  it’s up to you. One thing this crisis has taught us is that whole humanity has come together  and we are helping each other. We have got a very big population and it’s very hard to reach out to everyone  but whoever has come under the system and has followed the rules (have adhaar cards and bank accounts)  it has been easier to help.

How does it feel? Every artiste desires his work to reach out to as many people as possible and I’m glad that this film has reached out to 190 countries. Interestingly  before this movie happened  I was more or less  had no work. But I chose not to work for three years because I was busy preparing for Battle of Saragarhi  which  which never happened. So  I had grown a beard to my navel and my hair up to my small back. When Extraction released  I was just wondering  when the whole world was working  and out there  I was out of the whole thing. And now when everybody’s sitting at home and nobody’s working  my work is out there. So that’s what life is. I’m very grateful and fortunate to have landed this spot. Before the lockdown  what else you were busy with in terms of work? Are there more films in the pipeline that have gone on hold because of the lockdown? I was shooting a film  a Bollywood comedy with Ileana D’Cruz tentatively called Unfair and Lovely. We were almost through with that and had about 10 days to go. So that was a bit of a setback  I wish I’d finished that so I could then prepare for my one but since that is not finished  part of me stuck over there because to return to it after so many months and try and pick it up from there is always a bit of a bi*ch. Then I did another movie tentatively called Rat on the Highway  which is an out there kind of a subject. That I finished and there’s another movie called Mard  which was going to go into production but still it’s on a standby right by.

Most of the time  they stay indoors and would only go out for a walk  meet friends  or visit the Gurudwara or market place nearby.

05/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Chandigarh  get ready to pay more for liquor  petrol,The administration says the additional cess on is aimed at generating revenue amid the lockdown,Get ready to shell out more money for liquor and fuel in the union territory of Chandigarh. The UT administration is actively considering levying additional cess on liquor  petrol and diesel for revenue generation. A decision in this regard was taken during the daily review meeting held under Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday. A senior UT officer said  “Revenue generation has been hit hard amid the epidemic. We are mulling over imposing additional cess on liquor  diesel and petrol to generate revenue. The finance department has been asked to work out details for imposing this additional cess.” Notably  petrol in Chandigarh costs ₹65.82 per litre while diesel costs ₹59.30 per litre. Confirming the decision  Ajoy Kumar Sinha  UT’s finance secretary  said that keeping in view the reduced sources of revenue  some additional cess could be considered. The decision on the rate of cess is also under consideration. To generate revenue  the Delhi government has imposed a 70 percent “special corona fee” on sale of liquor besides raising the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. Haryana  too  has hiked VAT on fuel. Meanwhile  there was marked fall in people queuing up outside liquor vends on Tuesday from Monday night itself. Long winding queues could be seen outside liquor shops on Monday  which opened after 41 days when the administration eased Covid-19 restrictions from Monday. The serpentine queues at most vends  at some places more than a 100 people at a time on Monday  trickled down to smaller queues with a handful of people on Tuesday. On Sunday  the Chandigarh administration had allowed shops selling non-essential items  including liquor  to open. The vends are to open according to the odd-even formula  with odd numbered stores to open on odd dates  and even numbered stores on even days. Liquor vends on roads dividing sectors  as well as those in the six containment zones  are to remain closed. Of the 75 licensed vends  30 were open on Tuesday. Shopkeepers had to ensure that not more than five persons be present at a time in the shop  with timings fixed from 10 am to 6 pm. The liquor shops had closed after curfew was imposed in the city on March 24  to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the city. Keeping in view the heavy rush of customers at book shops  the UT administration decided to exempt them from the odd-even stipulation and allow them to open on all days. This will help reduce congestion at the stores. The UT administrator has also directed that discount and concession available to consumers for timely payment of property tax  water bills etc. should not be denied and last date of payment be extended accordingly.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-get-ready-to-pay-more-for-liquor-petrol/story-uBtMB5Zjo3ekMuqqTyl7UI.html
05/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Dealing with India’s drinking| HT Editorial,More controls  higher prices won’t help. A liberal regime will,On the first day of India’s third phase of the lockdown — where substantial relaxations were introduced — there was a degree of chaos. And nothing symbolised this more starkly than the long queues  the rush  the jostling  and the quarrels in front of liquor shops. It almost appeared that after 40 days  India was ready to party. However  the violation in social distancing norms worried governments considerably. Indeed  it opens up the possibility of a greater spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)  and squandering away of the gains made so far. There have been a variety of responses to this chaos. But the sharpest came from the Delhi government. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal  rightly  issued a warning that if violations continued  he will have to reintroduce restrictions. On Monday night  the government also imposed an extra 70% corona(virus) tax on liquor. Andhra Pradesh has hiked liquor prices by 75%. One may  intuitively  think of this as a wise measure. Governments aim to meet two objectives with higher prices. The first is to disincentivise people from lining up and purchasing alcohol  and thus controlling crowds. The second  at a time when state public finances are under great strain  is to ramp up extra revenues. But this is a mistake. One  there is a clear class bias in the decision because making alcohol expensive is unfair on the poor  while those with resources will continue to purchase alcohol legitimately. Second  it is not going to necessarily stop those who cannot afford the legitimate prices from drinking. Examples from states which have imposed prohibition show that there is an immediate parallel economy that springs up — and a nexus between those who deal in illegal liquor and crime flourishing. Three  illicit liquor also has serious public health implications  and can lead to a sudden rise in hooch deaths. And four  if revenue generation is the aim  hikes have to be reasonable and proportionate. Seventy per cent is excessive. In fact  governments need to recognise the surge in demand — and reform and liberalise alcohol sales. Allow more shops to engage in the liquor trade; allow online delivery — and the increase in volumes will lead to higher revenues. All of this  of course  must be done along with instituting more strict measures for social distancing at shops  and holding liquor vendors and citizens responsible. Indian political leaders have had an uncomfortable relationship with alcohol. However  the solution does not lie in more controls and prohibition  but a more liberal regime with regulation.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/dealing-with-india-s-drinking-ht-editorial/story-SxuTy0tf0wgConNdBlo0BK.html
05/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Gautam Gambhir on lockdown: I don’t want a single picture of me distributing rations  I hate it,MP and former cricketer  Gautam Gambhir is strictly against the idea of making charity for a cause look like any sort of marketing propaganda.  With a lot of time to spend with his family amid this extended lockdown  he’s ensuring he fulfils all his duties towards his constituency.,He gets disturbed while talking about the plight of migrant workers  irked on the mention of those who boast about their contribution to a cause. Balancing his duties as the Lok Sabha MP from East Delhi  and spending time at home with his family  Gautam Gambhir has his hands full and is staying calm. As the country enters third phase of the lockdown  the former cricketer talks to us about the measures being taken in his constituency “to bring the crisis under control”  relief work done by the Gautam Gambhir Foundation  and urges everyone “to be united  as this is the only way to win this battle”. Excerpts: Over 40 days into the lockdown... how are you holding up? I’ve got the opportunity to do all the things that I haven’t done throughout my life actually. I’ve always been busy  first because of cricket  and then politics. Now  I’m spending with my little ones — making them sleep  playing with them — seeing them grow is the best feeling. I’ve been telling everyone that look at this lockdown from a positive point of view. Your daughters must be surprised to see you at home all these days. Was it tough to explain the situation outside  to your kids? The younger one (Anaiza  3) is too small  and loves to play so she doesn’t have  that question. But  the elder one (Aazeen (6) does ask sometimes ‘why can’t we go out’  so I’ve told her there’s a lockdown. She’s only waiting for this to finish and then probably wants to go to Hamley’s for her birthday presents (she turned 6 on April 1). Also  she misses her school  friends  though she’s doing online classes  it’s not the same. Like many others celebrities and public figures  are you also being over active on social media during this time? Do you mind that or are you comfortable with the idea? It depends what do you want to gain out of this lockdown. I’ve always wanted to keep things private. Yes  I do have posted certain pictures and videos of my daughters on Instagram  which probably I haven’t done that in the past  but I don’t believe in putting everything out on social media. I don’t believe in putting my personal life  what my kids or I am doing at home on social media because some things need to be kept private as well. Lot of people do make videos and stuff but that’s their way of living life.  Two cats in one house  how long can they go without pawing each other?? 😹😸😻 A post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 26  2020 at 12:05am PDT That way you really haven’t talked much about the relief work your foundation is doing. Tell us something about that. What all has been done so far? One thing I want to share is that I’ve made very clear to my foundation team that whenever we distribute this the rations and food  I don’t ever wan’t a single picture of me because I hate it. I don’t want that. I see a lot of people who distribute kits with their own picture on it and I don’t believe in it.When you’re giving something to someone  why do you want to have your own marketing stuff on that? Okay  I won’t lie  we’ve got carry bags which has my foundation’s name on it  but not my photograph or anything  because if it gets lost  people should know that this entire thing is from the foundation. Apart from that I haven’t put a single video of me distributing. If you’re doing a good cause  do it from your heart not for people to start talking about it. If that’s your mission to do it  then your entire scenario and vision change about things. But if your intent is to help someone  then you don’t bother whether people are talking about it or not. It gives so much of self satisfaction. And there are many who claim they’re doing their bit but actually are not. To avoid such questions being posed later  are you maintaining any kind of a record for whatever relief work your foundation is doing? I’ve never lied about things. I’ve always given the right numbers and the data as well. I’ll never say that  ‘you know I’ve distributed 50 000 or 10 lakh packets till now. No  we distribute eight to 10 thousand cooked food and ration packets everyday and that’s the number. We have the data also for it — wherever it goes  we give them slips  they give us their IDs and mention which slum they belong to. We have given around 4 500 PPE kits so far  and we’ve got receipts from four different hospitals. So  everything is very black and white.  I bow down to my volunteers for risking their lives in last 30 days. Together we have distributed: Ration kits & meals to 10 000 every day 90 000 baby food kits 15 000 N95 Masks 4200 PPE Kits 2000 Bedding kits to Shelter Homes We will keep moving!🇮🇳@ggf_india @bjp4delhi A post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 23  2020 at 3:08am PDT Besides this  how are you keeping a check on the number of Covid-19 cases in your constituency? We’ve got around eight to nine hotspots in our constituency  so the entire focus is try to help people in these seald areas  as they’re the ones who’ll be deprived of lot of things. So  with the help of ACP and DCP  we try and give them as much ration as we can. But  at the same time  we’ve to be very careful that people don’t start hoarding it — that’s very dangerous. We want things to go to the needy. We don’t want people to collect stuff and say  ‘Oh  I have ration for another two or three months’. No  this is not what our aim is. We make sure we try and touch as many lives as possible. Also  from 9-10.30am every day  I interact with a lot of people in my constituency  all the volunteers who are distributing these kits. I keep telling them that it should go to the needy  it should go to the last man standing  last man who needs it. Despite so many people following the lockdown guidelines religiously  there have been cases where some group didn’t cooperate and posed a risk to everyone’s lives. Do you think some people are flouting these norms in the name of religion? This is the time where the country needs to be united  irrespective of caste  creed  religion and even social status. This will show our strength. Doesn’t matter which religion you belong to  if there are certain norms and advisories from the government  you have to follow them  otherwise a strict action needs to be taken. I’ve seen some videos where people have attacked doctors  nurses and police offers. My heart goes out to them. They haven’t gone back home for days and they also have families to take care of. They’re fighting on the frontline for us  they should be absolutely well-equipped to fight this battle  they need support more than anyone else in the country right now. We should try support them as much as we can.  Coming together of everyone in time of need is a true reflection of INDIA! We r making sure those in shelter homes have clean sheets  pillows  towels & masks I really appreciate Le Meridien & GM Ms Meena Bhatia’s generous contribution towards this cause! @bjp4delhi @ggf_india A post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 9  2020 at 11:13pm PDT But what about people without masks and in poor hygiene conditions roaming on the streets? Aren’t they equally dangerous to getting or spreading the virus? What’s is being done to take care of that aspect? That’s what shelter homes were built for — to put these people there  provide them enough food to eat  maintain their hygiene  monitor them regularly and make sure they don’t go out  do not spread this virus if god forbid they have a virus. That’s what our foundation did as well. We have two shelter homes —  Ghazipur and Yamuna Sports Complex. With a help of a 5-star hotel  who provided us with bed sheets  pillow covers  sanitizers  soaps  lot of things for hygiene  we’ve given it all to those shelter homes. Also  just having shelter homes will not solve the purpose  to maintain hygiene is very important. You need to see how many (people) do you need in one room because can’t just keep putting people without social distancing  it can be very dangerous. The haunting visuals of migrant workers stuck various parts of the country are still fresh in people’s minds. Do you think we could have been better prepared to handle the situation? Did they deserve all that pain? It happened in my constituency  at Anand Vihar bus stand. It was so disturbing. When our CM was doing this press conference  he said they’re feeding one crore people everyday. And then we saw the amount of people at Anand Vihar bus stand. They were two completely contrasting things. So  why don’t you just give the right data? Don’t give numbers for the heck of it. You’re only trying to fool yourself by doing that. There’s nothing wrong in accepting that we haven’t done it but will do in the future. We need to be honest to our own self and that’s the only way we can win this battle.

And she quips this is all “too new” for her. “I’ve had a lot of free time to myself  something that rarely happens because of shooting schedules and travelling around. I’m spending most of the time pampering my pets ” says the actor  who is also catching up on some movies.  Keety and me @bellajasminegokukeety 🌸 A post shared by  disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Apr 16  2020 at 12:53am PDT “I’m also doing my workouts at home along with basic dance routines to keep me occupied ” she adds. The 27-year-old had started off the year with a successful release Malang  and was excited for her subsequent biggies. However  due to all kinds of shoots being stopped  her films  too  had to be stalled. “My upcoming film Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai with Salman Khan got pushed  and so did the commencement of Ek Villain 2. I am hoping for everything to start soon. It’s difficult to stay at home  but it’s necessary for all of us  so that we can fight the pandemic ” confesses Disha. Even in this lockdown  her personal life was still under the scanner. Reports earlier did the rounds that Patani is maybe living with Baaghi 2 co-star and rumoured beau Tiger Shroff’s family in this lockdown. And her goofy video on Instagram with Tiger’s sister Krishna added fuel to the fire.  This is how we do it #quarintinelife @kishushroff 👭🤣 A post shared by  disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Mar 24  2020 at 2:01am PDT However  Krishna cleared the air and said recently that Disha isn’t living with them  she just lives close-by. On who else she is in touch with apart from Tiger’s family  all Patani says is  “I’ve been in touch with my family and my team (for work). We do our regular meetings etc on conference calls.” Amid the many things she is keeping herself busy with  the actor has also got time to self-introspect. And here’s the realisation she has come to in the past one-and-a-half months  “Nothing is more important than your and your loved ones’ health. We all need to come out of this pandemic  safely and in good health.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/disha-patani-on-lockdown-it-s-difficult-to-stay-at-home-but-it-s-necessary-so-we-can-fight-the-pandemic/story-P0e3a8en2rVtAHcebyr0UJ.html
04/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,We should restart elective laparoscopic and robotic surgery  says Dr R K Mishra,If immediate elective surgical procedures will not be started  he says that he expects many patients developing complications.,As the Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic sweeps across the world  it is causing widespread concern  fear  and stress to the patient who needs elective surgery. COVID-19 is spreading like an uncontrolled fire. While the government is taking steps like lockdown  educating people about social distancing  hand hygiene  etc.  most of the hospitals have stopped elective surgeries.  It seems to be the right decision for the hospitals but it has created panic among the patients who need laparoscopic and robotic surgery if elective surgery is not started immediately. There are procedures such as Wall’s that are scheduled in advance. Cosmetic surgery  hernia repair and cancer operations are among the wide range of elective surgeries that come with varying degrees of complexity and urgency. Many authorities have recommended ceasing all elective surgeries amid the pandemic until the transmission of COVID-19 slows. Some physicians have concerns about performing elective surgeries on asymptomatic COVID-19 patients  fearful that patient mortality and ICU rates can increase significantly for those with unknown infection at the time of surgery. But as per Dr R K Mishra  Director of World Laparoscopy Hospital  Gurugram  “The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis  taking into account a patient’s prognosis without the procedure.” According to Dr R K Mishra  delaying  or cancellation of these procedures often rapidly worsens the patient’s condition  potentially turning it into a life-threatening condition. He recommended that the surgeon should determine what is in the patient’s best interest and make a case-by-case evaluation and urgency of the procedure. Cancelled elective surgeries may also impact on health insurance and other payors  which may cause further financial stress. As most of the hospitals find themselves overburdened in the epicentre of the COVID-19 crisis  they may simultaneously find themselves in a challenging fiscal situation with continued uncertainty ahead. Location is also a factor for reintroducing elective surgeries. We should develop a process to perform elective surgeries in different specialized hospitals around the country. As World Laparoscopy Hospital is a single super speciality hospital dedicated to laparoscopic and robotic surgery  we cannot help the COVID-19 patients. At World Laparoscopy Hospital  we cannot treat medical patients and emergencies  so we have less risk of contaminating our staff or patient with COVID-19. We understand that during this pandemic  we cannot help our country to fight against COVID-19. Still  we can perform affordable laparoscopic or robotic surgery and thus help non-corona patients developing complications. Governments should learn to strike a balance between controlling the spread of COVID-19 and allowing elective procedures in the selected hospital who does not deal with COVID-19 patients. Elective laparoscopic and robotic surgeries and procedures may make up a significant percentage of a hospital or health system. Hospitals treating patients with COVID-19 face uncertain risks because India is still working to flatten the curve of the pandemic. We do not yet know when the curve will begin to flatten  reflecting containment of the virus. Hospitals that only do elective surgery must continue to operate and maintain sufficient capacity to treat patients when we reach the apex of the curve. World Laparoscopy Hospital thus is in an extremely challenging position. In the multispeciality hospital during elective surgeries  more people visit the hospital  cross-contamination is high risk. Multispeciality hospitals are delaying surgery by avoiding elective surgeries; it encourages social distancing and contaminant of coronavirus infection in OPD and waiting hall. In this situation responsibility of hospitals dedicated to elective surgery is high as they can decrease the load on multispeciality hospitals and give them the room to treat Corona infected patients. Before elective surgery is resumed in any super specialty hospital  there should be good availability of PPE and a reliable supply chain for at least 30 days of surgery. Consider having all healthcare workers and staff wear appropriate PPE inside and outside the operating room and having all patients wear good quality of masks. A hospital’s available resources should include peri-anaesthesia units  critical care  diagnostic imaging  and lab services. Assess the level of stress and fatigue among healthcare workers during post-operative patient care. According to Dr R K Mishra  surgeons  anesthesiologists  and nurses should develop strategy  planning and frameworks for minimal access surgery prioritization. They should make a proper decision of cancelled and delayed surgical procedures  a strategy for the phased opening of ORs  PPE availability  and issues related to increased OR volume. The coronavirus is not going to go away soon  so we must learn to live with it. Source: Digpu Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Digpu News Network.

04/05/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Union minister against easing Delhi curbs after CM’s ‘time to reopen’ remark,On Sunday evening  Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government will suggest to the Centre that only containment areas in the city be declared as red zones and not the entire district.,A day after Arvind Kejriwal’s “time to reopen Delhi” remark  Union Health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday said minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government to curb the spread of the coronavirus infection.  The Centre last week extended the nationwide lockdown  necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak  by another two weeks  till May 17. However  it has provided some relaxations depending upon the colour-coded - red  orange  green - zones. The minister hesitated in voicing his opinion  lest it be given a political twist.  “It would not be right for me to comment as it will be seen as a political statement. On a personal level  I think a lot needs to be done to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In this lockdown 3  I think that minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government. But this decision has to be taken by the state. Guidelines have been issued by the home ministry but the states are free to decide ” the minister told reporters.  On Sunday evening  Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government will suggest to the Centre that only containment areas in the city be declared as red zones and not the entire district. At present  all 11 districts in the city have been declared as red zones. “The time has come to re-open Delhi. We will have to be ready to live with coronavirus. The lockdown was necessary to contain Covid-19  but Delhi is fully ready to relax lockdown restrictions ” the Delhi chief minister said. Delhi has been under lockdown since March 23. The chief minister said coronavirus is going nowhere and it is impossible that cases of coronavirus will be zero. “Corona(virus) has come. It is impossible that there will be no cases of coronavirus because it has not happened across the country ” he said. Highlighting the adverse impact of coronavirus on the exchequer  Kejriwal said in April 2019  the government earned Rs 3 500 crore while in April this year  it only received Rs 300 crore. He said the Centre has put the entire Delhi under red zone due to which markets  malls cannot open. “We have suggested the Centre to seal those areas where cases of coronavirus have been reported and rest of areas can be allowed for the operation of all activities ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/union-minister-against-easing-delhi-curbs-after-cm-s-time-to-reopen-remark/story-DXapUsOfYkRCorWDOm0r8J.html
03/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,As Covid-19 peaks  beware of advertisers peddling false claims regarding the virus,,Covid-19 has completely changed our lives- I am not just referring to the lockdown   the social distancing  frequent hand washing and sanitizing surfaces and goods. Today  all our conversation is centred around Covid   just as almost all news is Covid-related. It’s therefore no wonder that advertisers too are trying to somehow link their products directly or indirectly to Covid or the circumstances surrounding it   to make it relevant and attract attention. Some are also using their advertisements for social messaging. But on the flip side  there are also advertisements blatantly peddling products through false or misleading claims related to Covid-19.  One such claim that attracted the most attention was of course the Arihant mattress advertisement in a Gujarati newspaper that went viral on the social media for its claim that the mattress was ‘ corona-resistant’ and ‘anti-corona virus’ !. The mattress maker soon found himself booked under various laws including the Disaster Management Act and the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act by the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration.  Besides those that make blatantly false claims and offer ‘cures’ for Covid -19   there are also advertisements that employ cleverly worded messages and deceptive visuals to misrepresent the importance or the need for such products to fight the dreaded disease. Well  there are several laws aimed at curbing such advertising and protecting consumers. . The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements ) Act for example  specifically prohibits such false and misleading advertisements relating to drugs  besides remedies claiming magical or miraculous properties.  The law prescribes as punishment  imprisonment up to six months or fine or both for the first offence and imprisonment up to one year or fine or both for subsequent offence.  False or deceptive advertisements pertaining to food are specifically governed by the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations and enforced by the state food safety officers. Violation of the Regulation attracts a penalty up to Rs 10 lakhs as per Section 53 of the Food Safety and Standards Act. I must also mention that in response to complaints about Covid-related deceptive and false claims   the union ministry of Ayurveda  Yoga  Naturopathy  Unani  Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) has on April 1  issued an order under Section 33P of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act  directing the regulatory authorities in states and union territories to “stop and prevent publicity and advertisement of AYUSH-related claims for Covid-19 in print  television and electronic media and take necessary action against the persons/agencies involved in contravening the relevant legal provisions …”.  The ministry has also asked the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)  a self regulatory body of the advertising industry  to monitor and report such advertisements. The Cable Television Network Regulation Act and Rules also prohibit deceptive advertising. The Rules in fact ban television advertisements that violate the Code for Self Regulation in Advertising   formulated and adopted by ASCI. The regulatory body- the Central Consumer Protection Authority- envisaged under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 has wide ranging powers to deal with all deceptive  false advertisements. Unfortunately  the Authority is yet to be constituted. The consumer courts have the power to order withdrawal of such advertisements  direct issuance of corrective advertisements and award costs and compensation to consumers  but only on a complaint from the consumer or the government. Unlike the Authority  the forums have no suo moto powers. Meanwhile consumers who come across questionable Covid-related claims can complain to the state drug control authorities or the food safety authorities  depending on the nature of the advertisement. They can also register their complaint on the website specifically created by the union ministry of consumer affairs for the purpose—Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements - gama.gov.in One can also complain to ASCI on its website- ascionline.org or on their whatsapp number: 7710012345 .,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-19-peaks-beware-of-advertisers-peddling-false-claims-regarding-the-virus/story-Gfj9VnT4A6vMJJxyx9bgSN.html

02/05/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,UP’s first Shramik Special train bringing back 847 migrants,Uttar Pradesh’s first ‘labour’ train  the Shramik Special  having 847 migrants onboard  will reach Charbagh railway station early morning on Sunday.,Uttar Pradesh’s first ‘labour’ train  the Shramik Special  having 847 migrants onboard  will reach Charbagh railway station early morning on Sunday. The train that left Nasik at around 10:22am on Saturday  is perhaps the first train to operate during the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to contain the deadly corona virus outbreak. Both Northern Railways (NR) and District administration have made elaborate arrangements at the station to maintain social distancing among the labourers. The initiative is a part of the UP Government’s exercise to bring back migrants from different states. After being brought here  the migrants would be quarantined in their respective districts. Divisional railway manager (DRM) Lucknow division  NR Sanjay Tripathi said  “We will act in co-ordination with the UP government  district administration and Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC). We have also made arrangements at the station to strictly ensure social distancing.” NR officials who did not wish to be quoted  said the migrant labourers would be received at two points—portico one and portico two. “At both the places  we have painted blocks on the platform floors on which the labourers would be asked to stand to maintain social distancing. There would be thermal scanners at both the porticos where the migrants would be scanned ” the NR officer said. Once the migrant labours cross the thermal scanning where medical teams would be deployed  the district wise segregation would start where they would be asked to stand in groups (gap among the people in group would be one metre). “There would be only one exit gate open from where these migrants would be allowed to leave the station premises ” officer further said. Mukesh Meshram  divisional commissioner  Lucknow said the migrants alighting at the station would first undergo health check-up. “Those who are through would be segregated district wise. We have also arranged around 65 buses. The groups would be asked to board the buses leaving for their respective districts ” said Meshram. The commissioner further said that they had also informed the district magistrates of the districts to receive the migrants and to put them under quarantine for 14 days. He said that on their arrival at the station  it would be ensured that the food packets and a bag of essential goods was handed over to each and every migrant. 7 500 MIGRANTS REACHED UP TODAY On Saturday  around 7500 migrants who were stranded in Rajasthan and Uttarakahand arrived in the state capital. Raj Shekhar  managing director (MD) said the two states transported the migrants to the borders of UP from where around 285 buses would be deployed to transport the migrants to their respective home districts. Besides  UPSRTC also deployed 35 special buses to bring back around 1000 migrant labourers from UP who were stranded in Haridwar district of Uttarakhand. “Those who returned from Rajasthan were dropped in Mathura district where we made arrangements to ferry them. And those returning from Uttarakhand were dropped in Bareilly district where we have deployed a fleet of 60 buses ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-first-shramik-special-train-bringing-back-847-migrants/story-iIQ25aNexaJJCxN9NnIGHL.html
02/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china,Can COVID-19 be transmitted through breast milk?,Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).,Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 in Wuhan  China and has not been previously identified in humans. Common signs of infection include fever  cough  running nose  shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases  infection can cause pneumonia  severe acute respiratory syndrome  kidney failure and even death.  Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing  covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing  thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. How does COVID-19 affect pregnant women? Are pregnant women more susceptible to the disease? There is not much scientific information on this subject as the disease is still very new. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes which make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections. Based on a limited number of confirmed COVID – 19 cases  pregnant women do not appear to be at an increased risk for severe disease. This is unlike other viral infections such as influenza  SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV where the severity is much more. Is the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes increased? There is not enough information to answer this question. However  with the other Corona virus infections  miscarriage  stillbirth and birth defects have been observed. Can pregnant women with COVID-19 pass on the infection to their fetus or newborn? Again  there is paucity of evidence on this. But in a limited series of women who delivered during the outbreak in China  the babies did not test positive for COVID-19. Can COVID-19 be transmitted through breastmilk? The main concern is not whether the virus can be transmitted through breastmilk  but whether an infected mother can transmit the virus through respiratory droplets during the period of breastfeeding especially when coughing or sneezing. A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic person under investigation should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant  including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask  if possible  while breastfeeding.  If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump  the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible  consider having someone who is well to feed the expressed breast milk to the infant. In a limited case series  no virus was found in the breast milk. However  it is not known if the virus can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk. Stay safe stay positive •Keep away from people - in other words practice “social distancing” •Avoid events and mass gatherings •Keep a distance of at least 6 feet with anyone who is sick or has symptoms •Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. •Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue •Avoid touching your eyes  nose and mouth if your hands aren’t clean. •Clean and disinfect surfaces you often touch on a daily basis •Act responsibly – please do not forward baseless messages on social media. Refer to the WHO and CDC guidelines. CDC doesn’t recommend that healthy people wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses  including COVID-19. Only wear a mask if a health care provider tells you to do so.

01/05/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Pay minimum wages to workers unable to report to work due to lockdown: HC,A single bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge while hearing a clutch of petitions challenging a March 23 notification by the ministry of Home Affairs  Union of India wherein section 10 (2) of the Disaster Management Act has been invoked.,The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has directed industries employing daily wage earners to continue paying to those workers who are unable to report for work due to the national lockdown  in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The court has however held that if the workers fail to report for work in areas where lockdown is lifted  the industries will be at liberty to deduct wages. A single bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge while hearing a clutch of petitions challenging a March 23 notification by the ministry of Home Affairs  Union of India wherein section 10 (2) of the Disaster Management Act has been invoked. The section ensures that workers  including the migrants are paid their monthly wages by the employers taking into account the peculiar situation on account of Covid-19. The petitions further pray that though they are willing to offer work and workers are willing to work  due to the lockdown the units are shut or working at reduced pace. Hence the prayer for exemption of paying monthly wages for the period of restriction of manufacturing activities. However  after the union of India and the state informed the court that the Supreme Court was seized of a similar petition and the Kerala high court had stayed an order of the finance department to pay salaries in a deferred manner  the bench said that it was not inclined to interfere. Thereafter  the advocate for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners were willing to pay 50% of the gross wages or the minimum rates of wages prescribed under the Minimum Wages Act  whichever is higher. The court accepted the same and held  “It is clarified that since the State of Maharashtra has partially lifted the lock down recently in certain industrial areas in the State of Maharashtra  the workers would be expected to report for duties as per the shift schedules subject to adequate protection  from Corona Virus infections  by the employer.” The court also allowed managements to deduct wages of workers who voluntarily remained absent by following procedure laid down in Law while initiating such action. This would apply even to areas where there may not have been a lock down. Thus  saying the matter was posted for further hearing on May 18.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pay-minimum-wages-to-workers-unable-to-report-to-work-due-to-lockdown-hc/story-YVstbRKGQ734LimoWzzWIO.html

30/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,In times of Covid-19  a gift of hygiene for migrant labourers,National Cadet Corps girls gifted clean pair of clothes to migrant workers living in shelter homes  making sure that their personal hygiene is maintained,Ever since stringent lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of COVID-19 across the world  roads  borders and city squares fell quiet. Many migrant labourers who weren’t able to make it back to their villages are now living in shelter homes provided by the government. While the government has made arrangements for their ration and daily needs  they are short of clothes and personal hygiene necessities. “At the shelters in Soniya Vihar  where we are deployed  we noticed that many labourers were wearing the same clothes for days  as they had no choice. So we decided to put together some lightly used and freshly washed clothes for them ”says 20-year-old NCC cadet Aartika Bhayana. Bhayana  with three more team members distributed clothes in all sizes to these migrant workers residing at shelter home. “We collected clothes from residents  our relatives and family members. We washed them  ironed them and gave it to more than 112 labourers. They were not expecting this and it brought an instant smile on their faces. They clapped for the entire team that this made this possible ” says Bhayana  who was supported by Ridhima Khanna  Preeti Singh and Kanchan Singh. The NCC cadets were assigned the task to maintain social distancing at the shelters  provide labourers with ration and other necessities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-times-of-covid-19-a-gift-of-hygiene-for-migrant-labourers/story-4Dbp3WtfsYukGlp74BxD9K.html
30/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,australia,Cops planned a lovely surprise for this sulking ‘birthday boy’!,Senior citizen Karan Puri could hardly believe when cops landed at his door with a cake. He was so touched by the gesture that he broke down. The emotional moment was captured in a video,In a sweet gesture  Panchkula police surprised senior citizen  Karan Puri with a cake to cheer him up on his birthday. Inspector Neha Chauhan  says  “We saw a Facebook post by his children tagging us and asking if we could do something for his birthday. So with the help constables Neha  Parvin  Aarti and driver Mahavir  we bought a cake and went to celebrate his birthday.” As soon as these police personnel spotted the old gentleman in his house  Puri started to retreat back in his house  fearing that they would reprimand him on not following the guidelines of the lockdown. He tells us on phone  the video not only went viral but went into overdrive. “Though politically incorrect  but it spread like coronavirus ” says Puri. As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences  including working from home  home-schooling and online socialising  it has also  unsurprisingly  increased the loneliness of all people. Puri says  “Like everyone else  even I hadn’t stepped out of my house at all due to the lockdown. But seeing so many people after a month with a cake for my birthday made me emotional and tears of happiness rolled out of my eyes.” He jokingly adds  “I have just turned 69 years young and anyone is bound to become emotional at such a celebration.” For loneliness  he says all of us have to bear it as we have no other choice. He says  “It’s not just senior citizens  but everyone is battling the demon of isolation. We all  are social beings and thrive on interactions and meeting new people.” Senior citizen gets birthday surprise from Haryana Police  video goes viral via @htTweets https://t.co/v7AeGebfpL Puri  owner of Atma Ram and Sons publishing house  says  “All my family including my granddad has been in publishing. At this time  I am missing my daily routine. More than anything  I miss travelling 11km to my store at Punjab University. Never thought I would say this but I miss the traffic and of course seeing new faces and meeting old acquaintances.” He has two sons  one settled in Australia and the other in Delhi who had requested Panchkula Police to surprise his father. He says  “I thank ACP Nupur Bisht  who planned the surprise.” Question him on whether he would like to celebrate his birthday like this every year  with the cops  and he laughs and says  “Are you kidding me?”As an afterthought he says  “Well  of course! I have celebrated my birthday in different continents but this was very different and I will cherish it for many years.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-can-t-be-locked-down-cops-planned-a-lovely-surprise-for-this-birthday-boy/story-62DPDzQH992MCWX8yEeAEJ.html

29/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,No one’s alone: Acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal stands by women in distress,Laxmi has asked women across India to connect to her through social media if they face harassment or domestic violence during the lockdown,A survivor of a brutal hate crime and acid attack  Laxmi Agarwal has come ahead to support women who are facing harassment and violence in the lockdown. Laxmi has asked women across India to reach out to her without hesitation if they face harassment or violence during the lockdown. The activist will connect them to lawyers  police and mental health counselors. “I want to tell these women that they are not alone  they are warriors in their own ways ” says Agarwal.  The 29-year old has been hosting lives on Instagram for her fans and has been encouraging women to fight back. She says  “I intend using this time for the benefit of others. I have done lives on many topics up till now  such as LGBT issues and mental health. Now I want to take up the issue of domestic violence. There has been a sharp rise in such incidents which is very alarming.”  She feels strongly for the victims of domestic abuse. With restrictions on movement aimed to stop the spread of the coronavirus all over the world  a new type of virus is on the prowl  that of domestic abuse. Isolation has led to a darker consequence  and violence in homes has become more frequent  more severe and more dangerous. Laxmi is forming a support group in association with activist Yogita Bhayana  founder  PARI (People Against Rape In India) to stand by women who are victims of domestic violence.  Laxmi says  “I get calls from many women including acid-attack survivors as to how their husbands and parents-in law are torturing them during this phase. In one case this newly married girl walked from Faridabad to Safdarjung at night in search for help. But with no help in sight  she had to return to the torture chamber.” Since the beginning of COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders  domestic violence calls have increased with people being cooped up at home  tempers more likely to be flaring  leading to abusers lashing out. Laxmi says  “During the epidemic  people are unable to go outside  and their conflicts grow bigger and more frequent. The lockdown was put to protect lives but it is shocking to see what females have had to endure through this life-saving procedure.” With the police focusing on enforcing the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus  females have no where to go and Laxmi’s counselling sessions might just be the balm on their wounds. She says  “Supporting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for me  and I am fully aware of the distress and anxiety this period may cause to those suffering or at risk of domestic abuse. I can’t reach to these people but police should try to intervene. Haath uthane se nahi  baat karne se solution nikalta hai.”  She tries to counsel them and motivates them through her online sessions on her Instagram handle  @thelaxmiagarwal. She says  “Through my counselling sessions over the years  I have dissuaded many from committing suicide. During this period too  I am trying my best to guide people through it all.” Bickering is inevitable but can easily spiral into all-out brawls when confined to a small space without anywhere to go. “Couples should really broaden their experience at this time and make room for their partner’s ideas and viewpoints leading to open discussions which can bring couples closer ” says Laxmi. She further recommends couples to spend time with each other  play games and get to know each other well as this time won’t come back. ‘’Time barbaad karne se achha hai ki abaad karein.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/no-one-s-alone-acid-attack-survivor-laxmi-agarwal-stands-by-women-in-distress/story-nzfgktqOokFYkU9KqUpVfN.html
29/04/2020,government;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,In hindsight: Covid profited from our mistakes,Looking back  there have been so many mistakes and so much misinformation that it is worth asking: could we have handled this better?,As we enter what might (or might not) be the final week of the nationwide lockdown  I thought back to the weeks since Corona took over our lives. My own view is that  compared to many Western countries  we haven’t done too badly. But looking back  there have been so many mistakes and so much misinformation that it is worth asking: could we have handled this better? The delay: Few people remember this but in the early years of this century  Asia faced the SARS pandemic. Though SARS was deadly in China  it didn’t spread much beyond East Asia because China locked down quickly and the use of masks became common in East Asia. At that time  India was warned that SARS would spread to our shores. We took basic precautions: checking passengers coming from East Asia to see if they had fever  etc. But SARS did not spread to India and we soon abandoned our checks. I suspect that gave us a false sense of security. Covid is a cousin of SARS  came from the same source and so  we thought  it couldn’t really do much harm to us. We had brushed off SARS. So we would brush off Covid. That’s why checks at airports were so casual ---- and ineffective. A friend of mine flew in from Bangkok in the first week of March. He was stopped at the airport. “Aap ko bukhar hai”? the health official asked him. “Ji Nahin”  he replied. “Achcha chale jayiye ” he was told. And that was that. It took us another precious week to begin serious checking at airports. The Complacency: The government also underestimated the deadliness of Covid. When it should have been preparing to fight the virus  it was busy organising Donald Trump’s visit to India. After that  pure cynicism probably set in. All through March  the ruling dispensation had been trying to topple Kamal Nath’s government in Madhya Pradesh. Nath tried to avert this imminent collapse by claiming that as Covid was spreading  the state assembly (where a vote on his future would be held) should be adjourned. This was politically convenient but not unreasonable. The central government  determined to topple him  told the Governor to refuse any adjournment. But this meant it could not adjourn parliament (despite demands from opposition MPs) because then Nath would have been able to claim that the assembly should also be adjourned. Eventually  Nath resigned on 20 March  which was a Friday. When parliament reconvened on Monday 23  it was duly adjourned. That weekend  international flights were finally banned as well. The timeline leaves very little to the imagination. Priorities were misplaced. Foreign Transmission. We believed  correctly  that the virus would only come from abroad. This was true enough but a) we hadn’t checked incoming flights thoroughly (the singer Kanika Kapoor  for instance  was ‘screened’ at Mumbai airport and allowed to enter) and that b) people who had contracted the infection would give it to those they came into contact with. Till now  we are committed to deny that there has been any “community transmission” a term which means that a person with no contact with anyone from abroad can be infectious and transmit the disease. So  we refuse to test people who have no foreign travel history in their family or friends. There are horror stories about people being refused tests because they had no foreign contact even though they displayed Covid symptoms and asked to be tested. It has now been six weeks since flights were banned. It is obvious that if new cases keep being discovered then  at least in some parts of India  there is community transmission. Jamaat: There is no doubt that the Tablighi Jamaat contributed massively to the spread of Covid in India. The organisation must be condemned. But let’s also admit that the police (under the Home Ministry) and the Delhi government failed in not breaking up the congregation --- especially as the police station was next door and the Delhi police knew that thousands were gathered there. Testing: What  people ask  could the government have done even if had acted earlier  even before the fall of the Kamal Nath government? Simple. It could have ordered more testing kits. Even now  India does not have enough. And our testing ratios are abysmally low. Lockdown: We can understand why the government was so keen to impose a lockdown in a hurry  having wasted valuable time in playing politics. But that does not excuse the manner in which the lockdown was imposed. Most countries give citizens enough time to prepare for a lockdown. We gave them a few hours. The rich and the middle class got by but the poor suffered. Even today  you will see heart-breaking footage of poor migrant workers  walking hundreds of miles home  their worldly possessions wrapped in a piece of cloth or a single carrier bag. This was unnecessary and thoughtless. If they had announced the lockdown earlier and given people a few days to adjust  thousands of people would not have suffered. Masks: Many of the other screw-ups are universal and not India-specific. The WHO and the US Surgeon General screwed up badly by telling us that we did not need to wear masks. Now  as infections have mounted  they have all reversed themselves and said that we will need to wear masks for the foreseeable future even when the lockdown end. Sanitizer: Have you noticed how nobody says very much about sanitizers now? At the start of the crisis we were told that hand sanitizers were good for fighting bacteria but useless against viruses. Far better  they said  to use soap which broke the lipid layer that coated each Corona virus. Now  nobody talks about that distinction. Were they wrong? Do sanitizers work as well as soap? The subject has kind of slipped from public consciousness. Droplets: The current scare. We know that Corona  like many respiratory viruses  spreads when people sneeze. Virus-filled droplets are released into the air. Gravity ensures that these droplets soon fall to the ground. But if you are near an infected person  you might inhale a droplet and get infected. Hence  the six-foot separation rule. We know also that if these droplets land on a surface that you later touch  you could be in trouble. At some stage  your fingers  which have touched the surface will find their way to your nose  mouth  eyes  etc. And then they will enter your respiratory system. Hence  the need to keep washing your hands and not touching your face. But now some scientists are claiming that infected people can sneeze out tiny droplets which remain in the air for hours.  Is this true? Well  yes and no. Other scientists say that the studies that show wide dispersal of droplets do not reflect the real-life situation because the droplets were sprayed out in tests with great force by devices that do not mimic human sneezing. Others say that even if such a droplet is still around for hours after being expelled from the body (in the air or on a surface) it is not necessarily infectious.  While scientists squabble  best to wash your hands and wear masks. Hydroxychloroquine: One of the strangest aspects of this crisis has been the rise of and fall of hydroxychloroquine  an 80-year-old-drug used to treat malaria  arthritis  etc. Donald Trump has touted it as a miracle cure around 40 times  even citing a flawed French study. Indian doctors have been quick to mimic this. And there have been foreign policy ramifications. When India refused to sell the drug to America  Trump threatened us with retaliation. We quickly caved in  which led to another uproar. But the point is: does it work? So far there is not one peer-reviewed study that says it does. And there are studies that say it could have dangerous side-effects. At present  the balance of opinion is that it is not a prophylactic against Covid and not a cure either. People & Doctors: In a sense  almost everything that has gone wrong in the handling of this crisis is only to be expected. This is a new virus. So doctors are still figuring out how to fight it. Mistakes are inevitable. And the cynicism and the thoughtlessness of politicians? Well that’s only to be expected  too. Isn’t it?

29/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Animation uninterrupted: Slow  but steady work goes on amid lockdown,Despite genuine hiccups in dubbing and final delivery  animation is one sector that’s able to bring out fresh entertainment even during lockdown  say industry experts.,At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the live action film and TV industry to a standstill  it’s the Chhota Bheems  Little Singhams and Motu Patlus of the home-grown Indian animation world that are alive and kicking. They continue to entertain the audience with new episodes  launches and ‘edutaining’ content across platforms. While no shootings are taking place  and TV channels are banking on re-runs as a bait for audiences  animation is one sector that is able to bring out fresh entertainment with either its bank of content  through industry experts admit that there are some genuine hiccups in dubbing and final delivery. Slowly but steadily  all aspects of production are running remotely from home  says Anish Mehta  CEO of animation studio Cosmos-Maya  adding that “new episodes of our shows are being produced on a daily basis.” Among their new show launches include Guddu  Bapu and Gadget Guru Ganesha on Disney India and OTT platform Zee5  apart from Motu Patlu and Selfie With Bajrangi  as well as their own IPs Lambuji Tinguji and Titoo. Children  for whom summer vacation has come a tad early due to the coronavirus crisis  are lapping up content  indicates latest BARC data which reflects a 39% growth in viewership for kids’ channels vis-a-vis the pre-Covid-19 era. Anu Sikka  Head - Creative  Content and Research  Kids Entertainment Cluster   Viacom18  says they were already prepared to roll out new content in April in time for the post-exam period  but then “pulled up the schedule a bit” to March instead.  Cartoon Network and POGO too premiered new content like Chhota Bheem Kungfu Dhamaka series and launched Bandbudh aur Budbak starting April itself instead of May. Besides  Sikka adds  “Animation has a huge shelf life and repeat value  even in normal circumstances.” Uttam Pal Singh  Head of Discovery Kids  says the pace of work is down to 70%  but the team behind Little Singham has been able to produce 20 episodes of the show amid the lockdown. They’ve also been able to deliver episodes of their other Bollywood-inspired home-grown property Fukrey Boyzzz.  Singh says the only bottleneck is n dubbing as voice artistes are unable to go to studios. So  one way they’ve worked around it is to cut down the language feed from 5 to just one in Hindi. However  he feels this phase is a good opportunity for the animation industry to explore new ways to work around the online business. This is validated by Rajiv Chilaka  CEO and Founder  Green Gold Animation  who says initially when the lockdown was announced  there was panic. But feasible work from home solutions have ensured work continues despite teething technical problems owing to connectivity. So  even though final deliveries may not be happening for certain projects to networks  he adds  “Those are things we can catch up on fast after the lockdown ends”. Chilaka  however  feels that it’s the VFX industry that’s in a bigger spot. Explaining the basic difference  Keitan Yadav  chief operating officer  Redchillies.vfx & Color  says that while animation is fully generated on a computer  VFX has an element of live-action in it. “And hence  many projects are stuck due to the lockdown  as there’s dependency on content  unlike animation which can be fully pushed into production from homes  from scratch ” Yadav says.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/animation-uninterrupted-slow-but-steady-work-goes-on-amid-lockdown/story-ItZKPNdnpn6oelLIAugNsI.html
28/04/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,Auto drivers in Pune reduced to penury amidst lockdown,There are one lakh in the city. While a section of the drivers own their autorickshaws  the others drive the autorickshaw and pay the owner a daily fee of Rs 250 per shift for a day,Autorickshaw drivers in Pune who have been forced to give up their daily income due to lockdown are facing severe financial crisis as they are sitting idle inside their houses. Movement of all vehicles except those engaged in supply of essential services and commodities have been banned by the state government to prevent the spread of Corona virus. There are one lakh in the city. While a section of the drivers own their autorickshaws  the others drive the autorickshaw and pay the owner a daily fee of Rs 250 per shift for a day. Pune Rickshaw Panchyat president Nitin Pawar said that the situation is grim for over a lakh auto drivers in the city in absence of daily income. “ Their financial position is precarious and there is a need for strong backing from the government to support this large section of the society which has become unemployed due to the lockdown.” Amol Gaikwad  an auto driver from Yerawada  said  “I have been sitting idle inside my house with no income. I have to look after my old parents  wife and two kids. The daily expenditures are mounting and it is becoming difficult to survive. Moreover  there is no help coming from either the municipal corporation or the district collector’s office which is making our life difficult.” Gaikwad who used to earn Rs 300 - 400 per day said that he has to pay the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) of Rs 4 000 for the auto. “I have defaulted on the last month payment and same will happen for this month. The banks are also harsh and not giving us any reprieve during this crisis  ” he said. Auto driver Ismail Shaikh   of Kondhwa is a diabetic who has eight members of the family to look after. “ We are in a deep crisis and don’t have any financial backing or assistance from the state government. Since the lockdown is in force  we can’t do any other job except auto driving. I am a diabetic and require daily medicine. Earlier  I used to earn Rs 300 on daily basis and same used to utilise for supporting the household. Now  whatever little I had saved is getting over and situation is not far when we will starve as no help is forthcoming from the government  ” he said. Khadki auto driver Kisan Gaikwad said “ I don’t have any money left to buy grocery and essentials. My situation has been reduced to that of a beggar due to penury. We dont have any future left if the lockdown continues  ” Pune Rickshaw Panchyat President Nitin Pawar said that the situation is grim for over a lakh auto drivers in the city in absence of daily income. “ Their financial position is precarious and there is a need for strong backing from the government to support this large section of the society which has become unemployed due to the lockdown.” He said the Panchayat was doing all it could to provide grocery and other essentials to autodrivers to whatever extent possible. “But still nothing can make up for their daily income. Their future appears to be grim and strong steps of financial help are the need of the hour  ” he said. He further demanded that the government extend cash benefit Rs 8000 per month for three months and ration for three months in the form of state package to the auto drivers. He also added that the government pay three EMI’s of those auto drivers who had bought autos on loan basis.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/auto-drivers-reduced-to-penury-amidst-lockdown/story-LwRvN6AdXOCPE8raAqv73N.html

From collecting and distributing food to the needy  enforcing social distancing and providing shelter to migrants  they are working almost 18 hours a day non-stop without meeting their families. Rising to the occasion  senior most police officers across India have been singing and dancing to encourage their team and beat gloom. We had never witnessed such heartwarming sights before! In Guna Kotwali in Madhya Pradesh  DSP Neha Pachisia’s video dancing to the tunes of ‘Sandeshe Ate Hai ’ a song from the movie Border has gone viral. The police officer’s team also joins her in the video. “As we fight a continuous battle against Covid-19  we are working very long working hours with no break  so I thought of boosting my team’s morale with a dance. We could so relate to the song…when our loved ones ask  ke ghar kab aaoge ” says Pachisia  who is known as Lady Singham of her area. One day  Pachisia was talking to her team  and the pent up pain came out. “One day  I asked my team if they had any complaints  some said they were away from family for days  some were missing their mother who was alone  some had not seen their children  some had health issues. They were feeling low  so I thought of boosting their mood  and make them feel that we are family ” she says. She asked everyone to share to whatever talent they had. When nobody came ahead  she took the lead and started dancing and singing. Soon  her entire team joined her.

28/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Chandigarh residents’ welfare body writes to UT adviser over domestic help issue,At a time when the number of Covid-19 positive cases have crossed 50 and the authorities are trying to ensure there is no movement between sectors  domestic help including cooks  gardeners and maids have been seen moving within sectors of the city.,The Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) has written to UT adviser Manoj Parida on Tuesday regarding the movement of domestic help including maids and gardeners in various sectors of the city. At a time when the number of Covid-19 positive cases have crossed 50 and the authorities are trying to ensure there is no movement between sectors  domestic help including cooks  gardeners and maids have been seen moving within sectors of the city. The issue was highlighted by general secretary of the Sector 33-B residents’ welfare association (RWA) Kuljinder Singh Sra. “Sector 33B mostly has retired army men who live alone or with their spouses  and are dependent on servants. Most help is hired from Burail village in Sector 45  but they had stopped coming due to the curfew. However  around 20 gardeners  cooks and other servants can be seen in the streets daily now. I have spoken to the beat police officers and asked them to set up a naka between Sector 33 and 45 to stop their movement.” Other sectors around Sector 45 have reported the same issue. President of the Sector 44-B RWA Swadesh Talwar said that he had received calls from various residents about the movement of servants in their sector and he had them to inform the police. Chief patron of CRAWFED Major (retd) DP Singh said a similar situation was seen in Sector 38 as well. “In my lane itself I see that around four maids have started coming to work again. They come from Sector 25 or Dadumajra village and I have asked residents to be more responsible and ask their maids not to come till the situation comes under control ” he said. Chairman of CRAWFED Hitesh Puri said  “Many positive cases have come up in the colonies of the city where most of the domestic help comes from. The matter is serious which is why we have written to the authorities and asked them to book these domestic helpers for violating curfew orders in order to discourage them from coming. The residents also need to understand the importance of curfew  and should report their neighbours if their servants continue to come during the curfew.” Police officers deployed in these sectors said they were aware of the matter and had set up a vigil around the villages to ensure that those moving without permission are booked.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-welfare-body-writes-to-ut-adviser-over-domestic-help-issue/story-5GTXeJsniuuYoge82n7SwM.html
28/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Wildlife photographer Tapan Sheth is itching to go back to forests post the pandemic crisis,Some of the exceptional clicks of Tapan include his photographs of Asiatic Lion  leopards  vultures  peacocks and tiger.,India has been under lockdown due to COVID-19 since March 25 and everyone is affected by it. There is  especially  a large chunk of professionals  belonging to the outdoors  who are facing this setback with utmost patience and spiritedness. One of those is the nature and wildlife photographer  Tapan Sheth  who cannot wait for the lockdown to be over so that he can go back to the forests  to Mother Nature  and start clicking wildlife again! Tapan is into clicking images of the natural surroundings and its inherent wildlife and since the lockdown has been invoked  he feels that the entertainment world is the one severely affected by it. Resident of Rajkot in Gujarat  Tapan has also been staying indoors for most of his days  which is in total contrast to how he used to spend all his time in the forests  obviously for work. He is now at home  having put all his assignments and projects on hold  due to the Corona virus pandemic. He says  “I had many safari tours scheduled for my photography projects. Half of them got postponed and half of them got cancelled. The entertainment industry  in general  will incur major losses. I had also planned my visit to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries  but I doubt it will happen anytime soon. Many other events of the artists have also been called off due to this pandemic.”  Some of the exceptional clicks of Tapan include his photographs of Asiatic Lion  leopards  vultures  peacocks and  of course  our national animal  tiger. Besides  he is also the owner of a reputed web design company  Sakshi Infoway Pvt. Ltd.  based in Rajkot. Speaking about his ‘office hours’  Tapan gets nostalgic while saying  “I miss being in the forests surrounded by the wildlife creatures and the pleasant atmosphere. This phase too shall pass. The unity of humankind will rise above everything and I hope everything will fall back into its place.”  However  he is aware that staying indoors is the only right thing to do if we want to defeat this pandemic. In fact  Tapan has humbly requested everyone to keep indoors and follow the government’s instructions to handle the disease.  We hope every Indian listens to him and stays home & stays safe!

Police said both groups wanted to set up stalls in the densely-populated area which led to the dispute. It was also revealed during the probe that the groups have been at loggerheads since 2019 and there have been frequent skirmishes between them.  “The injured were attacked on their face and neck with swords  sharp weapons  choppers and axe ” said a police officer.  The profusely bleeding trio was taken to Rajawadi hospital in Ghatkopar where two persons were declared dead on arrival. The police have identified six people from the group which attacked Rajjab  Premsingh and Mohamedali and have arrested two of them.  “We are looking out for four more persons ” said the officer. The police have registered a case under several sections for murder  attempt to murder  rioting  unlawful assembly and defying the lockdown rules.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-dead-in-group-clashes-in-mumbai-s-govandi-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-lZ5G8jfRs9wUsk9RqYWDLK.html

Yeh beemari bahut taqleef deti hai. Aap saans nahi le paayenge  aur jo log soch rahe hain unko nahi hoga  I want to ask them  ‘Has God given you immortality?’ Emergency care providers are working hard. Please think about them.

More so when it comes to her strong will power that’s helping her sail through the current crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kom has extended financial support to the needy  is spreading awareness through social media  besides making awareness videos for the government and Delhi Police. She is ready to do “more for her country”  but prefers doing it silently. While most of her awareness posts were received well on social media  there were odd ones out. Reacting to it  she says  “It’s normal to have both supportive and negative followers. I’m getting more encouraging responses and many are being influenced. That counts more than those few cheer-takers inflicting negativity.” Bothered by the situation around  Kom  37  encourages everyone to adhere to the “rules of the lockdown  maintain social distancing and stay safe”.

Even celebs weren’t spared. Singer-actor Meiyang Chang shared about how two bikers called him ‘coronavirus’  shuttler Jwala Gutta said people are calling her ‘half Corona’. Condemning these racial attacks  Kom had said the virus does not discriminate between colour  caste  region  religion or country. “This is inhuman and something we cannot accept at any cost and we are now at a very wrong time to even have this mentality. Even beyond Covid-19  this attitude needs to be erased from our people ” she maintains.

27/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Quarantine closet detox: 5 rules to let go of the clothes you no longer need but keep,A static life in the lockdown isn’t what any of us wanted  however  this leisure period has given us ample opportunity to do things we kept procrastinating  the first thing on our list being cleaning our wardrobe. Isn’t it? Experts list out tips  to do it right.,When you open your wardrobe  is it bursting at the seams? It’s a possibility that it may take one more than an hour to scour through the hundred pieces and pick that one white shirt. More often than not  a disorganised closet compels us to repeat the same pieces again and again  as we tend to spot them hanging right in the front. For some of us our closets are a little wonderland where we play out our sartorial fantasy. It’s a dress up box where we often end up rediscovering pieces we bought with a lot of love or have a memory attached to them. Think of your favourite pair of jeans from high school (which wouldn’t even climb up beyond your thighs) or a pair of baby pink corduroy pants or a polka dotted kaftan which your perhaps wore to an all girl trip to Capri.  Now with quarantine becoming a reality for all of us  it’s the best time to let go of things that we will never wear anymore? Why not be a wardrobe editor and omit the fluff? Now that we are trapped at home  due to the pandemic  if we don’t find time to do it  we’ll never be able to it. We got experts to give their unique takes on how we can edit down our wardrobes methodically to make dressing up all the more fun.  Rule 1: Don’t keep anything because of sentimental reasons. And trust us  a whole bunch of clothes will fit into this category. Do not keep items just because you paid a lot for them or because someone special gifted them to you. “If you have not worn anything since the last two years  chances are you would never wear it again so you should aggressively throw these items out of your closet except for heirlooms and classic pieces ” advises designer Shruti Sancheti. Rule 2: Don’t keep garments of the wrong size. You’re a victim of wishful thinking if you believe you may fit into them some day. If you are a size 8  just keep garments that are the same size. “It is unlikely that clothes which are a few sizes small or don’t flatter will ever do so  so one should belligerently give it to people of that size or body type. It is good to be charitable and count your blessings as this category would be something which you cherished ” says Sancheti. Rule 3: So that polka-dotted little dress has sweet memories of a sweet day out when you were in college. But  really  are you likely to ever wear it again? Even if they make a comeback  it will be with a fancy new moniker. ‘Fads should not be hoarded  especially last season’s style  as even if they come back  they will be in a different avatar ” adds Sancheti. Rule 4: Keep the basics. White shirts  blue jeans and a classic watch are all you need plus some quirky accessories. “I always feel classics are the best investment and a trans-seasonal wardrobe is the new drift along with WFH wardrobe so perennial favourites like neutrals and timeless colours should be held on to  for prolonged usage ” suggests Sancheti. Seconding this  stylist Pranay Jaitly says  “One should always hold on to their personal favourites and we feel it’s essential for a wardrobe to have a crisp white shirt  blue denims  a nice tailored black pants and a pair of shoes that could work for both morning and evening wear.” Rule 5: Keep the colours that suit your complexion. “Colours in one’s wardrobe mainly should depend on what complements one’s complexion  however  keeping the current pandemic in mind and assuming that we would all be able to step out in the next month we should stick to summer colours like powder blues  baby pinks  mint green and salmon ” advises stylist Shounak Amonkar.

27/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Quirky ideas make an impact: After corona helmets  artist comes up with corona auto!,These outlandish art pieces prove that humour is the best medicine  even in the time of corona!,With life at a standstill during the lockdown  artists have been coming up with creations to spread awareness about coronavirus. An artist in Chennai came up with the idea of corona shaped helmets a few weeks ago. Police officers in Chennai wore the helmets to deter people from stepping out of their homes. Now  he has modified an autorickshaw to look like coronavirus with spikes in its body to spread awareness about the infection. B. Gowtham  the creative artist  says  “When I started to work on the corona helmet and then this auto  the idea was to make the city administrations’s and police’s work easier with attention grabbing art.” He adds  “The auto is the identity of the city so it was my obvious choice as it would send out the message loud and clear.” The Corona auto is being used to spread awareness among the people of Chennai to wear a mask while being out of their houses. The Chennai based artist says  “Even if my initiative can save one life from the deadly virus. I would be very happy.” The auto is made of 165 discarded plastic bottles. It took six days with the help of six people to make this quirky piece of art. “While making it  we had to be very careful as it had to look aesthetically beautiful as well as technically sound ” says Gowtham. To make work easy for the administration  the auto is fitted with an audio system to transmit awareness messages about wearing the mask. The 27-year-old artist says  “Wearing masks is a necessary precaution and if people of Chennai don’t abide by the rules  they will be heavily fined. This auto is here to make people aware of the crisis we are facing and how a simple measure such as wearing masks will go a long way in helping save lives.” The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of our dysfunctional relationship with nature. Gowtham adds  “In many ways  corona virus has made us aware that as a human race  we are so tiny and we have always been ruthless to our planet and never really considered it as our home.” Gowtham feels that if we follow all rules of the nature  do not spit or litter and add less carbon footprint  we will be able to create peace and harmony and co-exist beautifully with nature.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quirky-ideas-make-an-impact-after-corona-helmets-artist-comes-up-with-corona-auto/story-eS8TMaDk867JphAqEfoZOK.html
26/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;mali,Is revenge shopping a post-pandemic myth?,With events and weddings getting cancelled and everyone warming up to the idea of repeating  the much-speculated impulse purchase may not be a possibility at all,While a section of fashion set is hopeful that the post pandemic era will usher in a wave of revenge shopping  however  if one analyses the retail situation realistically  one could safely deduce that it may not be a possibility at all. With global economy being badly hit in the wake of Covid-19  cutting down extravagant expenses and tightening one’s belt seem to be the key priority on everyone’s mind. Besides  even if the shutdown eases in the future and one decides to make impulse purchases  where are the parties and events to go to  where one could flaunt one’s latest buys? As a society  Indians have always been careful shoppers and a bargain buy or a discounted purchase is always the shopping mantra.   Given the extended period of lockdown  most of us have got the opportunity to rediscover our wardrobes and came across multiple pieces  which we’ve accumulated over the years  but never wore them. Also  one doesn’t want to get rid of the items one has bought with a lot of love. Moreover  repeating pieces is cool today with fashion set making a noise about embracing sustainability. In this backdrop  there’s a possibility that the revenge buying may not happen at all. During this lockdown  Sunil Sethi  Chairman  FDCI has rediscovered many items of clothing and accessories in his closet  which he always kept aside and never got the opportunity to wear. “As I have lost weight over the years  I’ve started warming up to pieces  which now fit me like a glove like my seven pairs of jeans  which I could easily wear for the next couple of years. Also  of late  I’ve rediscovered my jackets in which I fit into like never before as I have been able to get back in shape. So I don’t see myself indulging in revenge shopping post the lockdown ” says Mr Sethi.   Designer Suneet Varma opines that people will be confronted with lot of moral dilemma once the restrictions ease up. “Revenge buying doesn’t work necessarily and is only applicable for the quintessentially classic pieces. One may want to buy a beautiful piece of art or jewellery or a classic sartorial piece  which will last long. This will be the norm of life - embracing classicism as opposed to hedonism. Of course  there will be a one-off case of someone crazily buying 10 lehengas to choose from. (laughs). Normalcy or maybe borderline boring will be the new influencer as opposed to something new  hep or cool ” says Suneet.    Fashion is always consumed among a certain set of parameters like when one is going out to a party so shopping is often occasion specific. “No one wears new clothes at home to watch Netflix. Hermes and Chanel stores in China may have raked in profits recently  but this buying is not happened anywhere in the world. In India  everyone is praying that the situation normalises before the festive season kick starts. Indians are inherently sensible buyers and never been swayed by the luxury market like in other parts of Asia. Hence  shopping will be need-based and there won’t be any mindless stocking up of merchandise. People will discover the joy of inward gratification ” says designer Nachiket Barve.   Designer Nimish Shah says  “You can buy a dress  but where will you go wearing it. The new money customer will be very sceptical post pandemic. Currently  everyone is deprived of eating out  salons and bars. These categories will pick up momentum first and fashion will come much later. People will shop sensitively  they will first see if a product is great and the price is safe. Also  there will be a shift in the mindset and people may not shop for high street brands  but support indigenous homegrown labels. I see luxury customers waiting for a big chunk of discount on designer products. They’ll buy one bag and not five.”  Designer Monisha Jaising notes that the sentiment of pride synonymous with luxury purchase won’t exist. “The feeling of pride associated with luxe buying may not be there. It could just be the reverse of that. As far as revenge shopping is concerned  I definitely see it happening initially but then there will be a sudden dip.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/is-revenge-shopping-a-post-pandemic-myth/story-y4iOTPBIoKR8ToRZKK2BkM.html
26/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Lockdown Fashion: Pyjamas are the new jeans,The coronavirus pandemic has utterly transformed the way most of us dressed  because now shirts have been replaced with oversized  boyfriend tees and jeans have been replaced with PJs. Designers and stylists tell us how they will influence our post-pandemic fashion as well,It’s been a couple of weeks now and you are  slumped over the grimy keyboard wearing a striped satin PJ set  and you’ve been in pyjamas since the lockdown started? We all responded to the crisis by shutting down our wardrobes and sticking to those comfy printed sets in cotton or mulmul. They are the most comfortable and effortlessly chic options to don at times like these. When you’re juggling work conference calls with household chores  comfort takes focus. Once the lockdown ends  it’ll be a challenge for most of us to slip into a body con dress or a bespoke suit. Last year  loungewear became quite a rage - from satin twinsuits to striped pyjamas with drawstrings and kitschy printed ones. International designers such as Alexander Wang  Dolce & Gabbana  Dior  Fendi and Chloé showcased these alongwith a few high street labels. However  some drifted away from the trend due to its laid back  relaxed and slouchy look.   If we must leave  we're doing it in style 😉 ⁠ #MLAllDay styled by the amazing @mimicuttrell ⠀ -⠀ ⁠⁣⁣Source @pagesix @splashnews A post shared by  Morgan Lane (@morgan_lane) on Apr 2  2020 at 7:05am PDT However  soon the sartorial choices would filter down to pyjamas as they have become our work-from-home uniforms during the pandemic and it would be hard to get away from its indescribable comfort. Stylists suggest that adding a touch of formal elements can be a chic idea. “Team the PJs with an elegant top  heels and a good statement bag or purse to add the formal touch or go for the elegant satin flower pair of pjs. If you’ve got the checkered one then a crisp shirt and sneakers could also look cool. I wouldn’t advocate the quirky print pairs for the outdoors. Unless you’ve got an entire set and that’s perfect for a late night movie date ” suggests stylist Isha Bhansali.  Designers feel we might see them on runways internationally and in India as well. “We would definitely see myriad interpretations of the pyjamas on the runway starting from sustainable pyjamas as we are all moving towards eco-friendly practices  derivation of Indian culture with art and craft on pyjamas would also be another factor. Block printed pyjamas or tie and dye full sets or contemporary prints are some we would see on the runway ” says designer Ridhi Mehra. She believes there would be a variety of our basic and all-time-favourite prints such as stripes  checks or prints from the Indian heritage.

25/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,israel,Covid-19: Coronavirus lockdown imperils Ramadan meals  assistance in Gaza,The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is a time for giving  with mosques and charities feeding thousands  but coronavirus has left many in the Gaza Strip wondering how they will manage this year.,The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is a time for giving  with mosques and charities feeding thousands  but coronavirus has left many in the Gaza Strip wondering how they will manage this year. “The markets and mosques are closed. The good people who give us money or aid each Ramadan are facing a tough situation ” said 47-year-old Palestinian Salah Jibril  who is unemployed. He and his wife live with their six children in a cramped two-bedroom flat on the outskirts of Gaza City. He said his family normally counted on using the assistance they received during Ramadan to help them throughout the rest of the year. “This is the hardest Ramadan we have faced. We don’t know how we will cope ” he added. So far  there have been 17 officially declared cases of coronavirus in the Gaza Strip  an enclave of roughly two million people. That’s partly due to rapid measures taken by the local government  run by Islamist group Hamas  which has announced all mosques will remain closed throughout the holy month.  Large public prayer gatherings will be banned  with people told to stay at home. Gaza’s population is almost exclusively Muslim. During Ramadan  the faithful refrain from consuming food and even water during the day  breaking their fast at sunset with family and in large groups. Mosques and other charitable organisations feed thousands of poor people during the month  while individuals often give large sums of money to help the impoverished -- a donation known as zakat. But this year in the strip  large public meals are banned and no concrete announcements have been made about alternate arrangements.  Donations are expected to be down due to the global economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Hamas announced this week it was giving $100 to 5 000 poor families in the strip ahead of Ramadan. Jibril’s was not among them.  He receives around 1 800 shekels ($500) every four months from the local ministry of social affairs. “It isn’t enough to pay the electricity  water and gas bills  a well as the food and drinks  and medicine for when the kids are sick ” he said. The family has no detergents or sterilisers. A small bar of soap on a broken sink is all they have to keep their home clean. Umm Mohammed  Jibril’s wife  said she couldn’t remember when they last had enough money to buy meat. “Corona(virus) is worse than a war ” she said. Around 80 percent of the strip’s residents rely on aid  according to the United Nations. Fifty-year-old father of seven Abdullah al-Omreen used to earn a meagre living selling fruit and vegetables in central Gaza  but is now unemployed. During Ramadan  “we receive alms from the rich and they also provide us meals daily. But this year the whole situation is different ” he said. “It will be difficult for everyone. I am afraid no one will give us anything.” The coronavirus crisis has increased calls for Israel to lift its crippling  almost 13-year-long blockade of the enclave that it insists is necessary to isolate Hamas. The Islamist group has fought three wars with Israel since 2008. The mood might be dampened  but many Gazans are still getting into the Ramadan spirit  putting up decorations on the front of their homes. “Despite the difficult economic situation due to the coronavirus  we decorate our homes with Ramadan lanterns ” said Moeen Abbas  owner of an ice cream shop. “We want our children to feel the atmosphere of the holy month.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

25/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,‘Make rural economy the focus in coronavirus aftermath’: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh,Emphasis on rural economy has been underlined by the RSS and its affiliates even during consultation that take place before the annual budget is prepared.,The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS)  an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has urged the centre to focus on rural economy as it draws up the plans for reviving economy and job sectors in the aftermath of the corona pandemic. “It is a good time for the government to ensure that while they offer stimulus packages to the medium and large enterprises  the cottage industry and the small scale sectors that keep the rural economy going are not neglected. That is where the revival will be and where the jobs will be ” said Badri Narayan Chaudhary  the national general secretary of the BKS. Large scale movement of workers back to their native states has led to concerns that many sectors including manufacturing  construction and even agriculture will face labour shortage. Even as the government claims the movement of migrant workers will be reversed after the lockdown is eased; the BKS functionary claimed otherwise. “A majority of the workers who have moved back to their native places from urban centres are unlikely to move back. The government will have to find them jobs or ensure they have entrepreneurial skills to sustain their livelihood ” he said. Chaudhary said  small sectors such as flour grinding mills  packaging etc. can be encouraged at the rural level. Emphasis on rural economy has been underlined by the RSS and its affiliates even during consultation that take place before the annual budget is prepared. “We have also suggested to Prasar Bharati (public broadcaster) that instead of focusing on old forms of agriculture on their DD Kisan channel  they should invite experts who can given demonstrations to the rural youth on how to become entrepreneurs and on the latest techniques that can be used to employ more people ” he said. The BKS has also urged the centres to ensure its advisories on transportation of agriculture produce and purchase at minimum costs are followed on the ground. Concerned by the losses faced by farmers on account of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the corona virus  which has hampered the transportation and sale of farm produce  the BKS has urged the government to ensure that farmers are paid the minimum prices. “Our suggestion to the government is to ensure that administration at the local level follows the guidelines that have been issued. When trucks carrying goods are stopped for days at police check points  it affects the farmers because their produce is perishable and cannot be stocked for long. This problem is being faced by farmers growing fruits  vegetables and other produce ” said Chaudhary said. Prabhakar Kelkar  the all India vice-president of the BKS said there should be monitoring in the mandis to ensure that farmers are paid the minimum prices.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-rural-economy-the-focus-bharatiya-kisan-sangh/story-P8xffDC58nZELWTTbUfcrI.html
24/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Gajraj Rao urges the privileged ones to not complain amid lockdown: A huge chunk of the population is suffering without food  ration or medical facilities,Actor Gajraj Rao asserts that instead of cribbing about this lockdown situation  the entire family should come together and share household chores and not put all the burden on the female member of the house.,This lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic has not been easy on anyone. Many miss their work and are bored of being cooped in inside the homes with a lot of restrictions on movements. But Gajraj Rao feels that people who are complaining about the present situation from the comforts of their home  should take a minute and think of the plight of the crores of people who have nowhere to go amid this crisis. “What’s important to realise is that people who are living in their homes with all the basic facilities available. We shouldn’t complain at all. There’s a huge chunk of the population that’s suffering. They don’t have food  ration or medical facilities. We’re very fortunate that we’re in our homes and our basic requirement is getting fulfilled ” he asserts.

However  he does have a word of advice for all the male members of the family. “Saare family members milkar kaam karo ghar ka. Don’t put the burden on one person. Especially in Indian society we see that the wife  or the mother or sister or girlfriend is taking care of everything. I’m telling everyone to do their share of work. You shouldn’t treat yourselves as a nawab of some estate and you will just sit and just do your office work on the laptop while the female member of your family do other chores.

A video showing two hungry kids of the family crying for biscuits went viral on social media and prompted chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday to ask authorities to take immediate action and provide relief. “My appeal to people is that do not pay attention on rumours. In this epidemic situation  we can fight the Corona virus and rumour only with social support ” Soren said in a tweet. Geeta Devi  the mother of the two  said on April 18 a few villagers alleged she was suffering from Covid-19. “When I asked them how could they know? One of them alleged that my brother in-law came from Chattisgarh and he is suffering from Covid-19. I tried to convince them nobody came from anywhere ” said Devi  whose husband  Ishwar Kumar Mahto  a labourer  has been jobless due to the Covid-19 lockdown. She said the next day the villagers prevented her from drawing water. “No food was cooked that day in absence of water. To prove the villagers wrong  we went for a checkup on April 19. The report came negative but the health officials asked us to remain in home quarantine for 14 days ” she said. Devi added despite showing the report  the villagers asked them leave the village. “The next day  the villagers did not even allow me refill my LPG cylinder. They are not allowing us to even come out of our house ” Devi said. She sought police help on April 21. Dhananjay Kumar  the in charge of the local police station  said they helped the family get water and convinced the villagers ignore rumours. “If the family was harassed again  we will lodge a case against the villagers.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-family-alleges-boycott-over-covid-rumour/story-ElAIzST4BV3urWY9eA9rhK.html
23/04/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,4.2K Covid-19 cases reported in Mumbai  930 containment zones,Most new cases from among those quarantined  187 containment zones out of list,The number of containment zones in Mumbai shot up by 117 between Tuesday and Wednesday  taking the total to 930 as of Wednesday evening  according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city also increased by 522 on Thursday  taking the total to 4 205. Mumbai has seen a total of 167 deaths  with six new deaths recorded on Thursday. However  a presentation made by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta to the Centre said there are 771 containment zones in Mumbai. Explaining the difference  Pardeshi told Hindustan Times  “The number of containment zones increases every day  and fluctuates as some zones finish their 14-day quarantine period  and show no patients with symptoms.” Pardeshi confirmed that as of Wednesday evening  there were 930 recorded containment zones in the city.  The G-South ward in Worli crossed the 500 Covid-19 positive cases mark  and recorded 507 cases as of Wednesday. The same data revealed that 62.8% (2 360) of the total cases in Mumbai fall in seven wards –G-South  E ward of Byculla  L ward of Kurla  K-West ward of Andheri West  F-North ward of Wadala  G-North ward of Dadar and Dharavi  D ward of Tardeo and Malabar Hill  and K-East ward of Andheri East. However  the silver lining is that most new cases are among people already quarantined by the BMC. “It is a good thing because it means we have been able to contain the spread to the area which is already a containment zone. In containment zones  there is rigorous contact tracing  testing  fever clinics  and strict lockdown ” said Pardeshi. Also  the BMC removed 187 containment zones from its list until Wednesday  as these are areas have finished their 14-day quarantine period and showed no new cases. The solution for BMC going forward is quarantining more people  who are contacts of Covid-19 positive cases. Another method of containing the outbreak in these areas is monitoring human movement with drone images. “We are flying drones every day  all the time  and carefully inspecting feed from them for any crowding. Police or ward staff is immediately intimated  and these people are moved indoors. Food packets are delivered on time.” Kiran Dighavkar  assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward  said  “We are increasing our quarantine facilities and ensuring that our hotspots and containment zones have a regular supply of food and medicines.” Dharavi recorded 25 new cases and one death on Thursday taking the total count to 214 cases  and total 13 deaths.  K-WEST WARD SEES 41 cases in 24 HRS Sagar Pillai MUMBAI The K-West ward  which covers Andheri West  Irla  Juhu  Oshiwara and parts of Jogeshwari  has reported 41 cases within 24 hours  taking the tally to 264  according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s data on Wednesday. There were 123 positive patients on April 17. So far  32 patients have been cured and discharged. Anand Nagar and Gandhi Nagar are among the seven hotspots. Ranjeet Dhakane  deputy municipal commissioner of K-West ward  said  “A majority of the hotpsots are in slum areas. We are setting up more fever clinics. A door-to-door survey is being carried out to identify people at high risk and quarantine them within three hours.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-2k-covid-19-cases-reported-in-mumbai-930-containment-zones/story-dbfG406prLijWH7j5JsstN.html

22/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,jersey;mali,Key emerging fashion market: Work-from-home attires,Designers predict a pocket-friendly and utilitarian closet for an emotionally and financially exhausted customer.,In the wake of Covid-19  formals or corporate wear seems to be on a verge of a major revolution. Of late  someone as formal and proper as Anna Wintour  editor of American Vogue has been seen lounging in a pair of track pants at her house. This definitely speaks volumes of the times we live in  where style lines are getting less rigid and comfort is given the top priority. Unlike the formality existing in the office cubicles  designs are getting more comfort-driven  breathable and languid. Since only one’s torso is visible during the zoom calls  the sartorial focus is likely to be on details of the top wear like collars and sleeves. Looks like that decorative necklines and plackets are going to be important design details while prints and patterns are going to take a backseat as they distract the zoom view. Designer Neeta Lulla sees a potential in the emerging market for clothes laced with comfort and ease. “I see formal tops like jackets teamed with culottes and shorts. Also  shorts will be very popular. We are looking at working on dhoti pants with soft shirts  going easy on the embroidery and focusing more on cuts. I see soft jackets in linen and softer fabrics like viscose and jersey gaining prominence. Also  most of the blazers will be without a lining. T-shirts or soft shirts in monotones or pastels will be popular along with cargo and harem pants. Colours will be bright yellows  pastels  peaches and neutrals as opposed to anything too jarring ” says Neeta.  Designer Shruti Sancheti observes that even if lockdown is lifted  only 30 per cent of us will be working from office. “The need of the hour for an emotionally and financially exhausted customer would be formal pret  which is pocket friendly  easy to multitask and looks dignified for official purposes and is trans-seasonal at the same time. Now we shall focus on our pret brand and come out with budget-buys and youthful solutions to cover a wider age group and retain the timeless and easy to wear factors ” says Shruti. Leisure wear is going to evolve quickly and comfort driven home wear essentials are going to fall into acceptable office attires in times of digitalisation. Designer Aniket Satam says  “Talking about future  many brands are working on downloadable digital wardrobes  which act like a filter where you can choose your jackets and make a visual presence without actually purchasing one. This approach will be both sustainable  economical and super on trend in given fraction of time.

22/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,pakistan;india;oman,This Pakistani pilot urges the world to always stay united,It’s through the darkest times that we see humanity prevail  let’s stay this way in the best of the times as well  says Mahipal Ladher  the second Hindu pilot of Pakistan,Mahipal Ladher  a pilot working at Pakistan International Airlines  has been flying people stranded due to the lockdown  desperate to head home. Mahipal is the first pilot from Tharparkar  a poverty stricken district of Sindh province with a population of 1.6 millon people. The Tharparkar desert lies along the Pakistan-India border. When Mahipal was a little boy  his town didn’t have a single paved road connecting it to any other town. It would take almost 12 hours to reach the nearest town  barely 70 km away. While growing up  Mahipal grazed cattle and at times  walked for a few kilometers to fetch water for his home  like other children of his town. But every time little Mahipal saw an aircraft show up in the sky  his heart would skip a beat. The boy would run after the plane  chasing the contrails  dreaming he would be flying one such aircraft someday. Tharparkar has always been an example of Hindu-Muslims unity where the two communities draw strength from a shared heritage and history  and perhaps that’s the reason why Mahipal holds the values of co-existence so dear to his heart. Studying initially in a government school and later an army-run school  Mahipal came to Karachi for higher education and training. “I have been living in Karachi for the past 17 years and thanks to its diversified culture  the two things I have learned here are invigoration and charity. People here just don’t stop living and giving! ” he says. With COVID19 pandemic being so dangerously contagious  his country is also locked down like other parts of the world. “Like many others  I played my role by raising money for the needy from home. I also had to do my duty. There were people who were stranded and needed to reach home  specifically in the Northern areas of Pakistan where one relies upon the air mode of transport as the roads are covered with snow most of the time. PIA never stopped flying to such areas. I take pride to be a part of the crew that takes such people home and brings a smile on the faces of their loved ones ” he says. Talking of family  he says the COVID-19 pandemic has made us realise that the whole world is connected  like a family. “Sadly  the only time we start acting like one is when we face such a crisis. Having said that  it is still a positive sign that we are all in this together. We have become the best version of ourselves  trying to help each other in every way possible. All I truly want and hope is that this sense of belonging stays even when this pandemic is over ” he says. While there is gloom everywhere and we have lost so many lives to the virus  it’s certainly not the end of the world  unless we bring it upon ourselves deliberately  says Mahipal. “In 1918  when the world wasn’t this advanced  people fought the Spanish Flu pandemic simply by following the rules spelt out by experts. We need to do the same and we will get out of it for a fact. We have to rise above and we will  it’s the aftermath we need to look out for. The recession is going to hit the world pretty bad and we will have to change the way we live. The world needs its rich to help the poor ” he says. Mahipal urges everyone to hold on to optimism. “Mother Nature works in mysterious ways. We’re being pulled back so as to bounce back  finding better versions of ourselves. There may be delay but there’ll definitely be a better future tomorrow”. Among the heartwarming videos and posts showing people helping each other  there’s one that Mahipal particularly likes. “So there’s this poor old woman who was being offered a ration bag and she refused to take it saying that she already has few days’ ration at home and that there might be many more needy people out there. Such a generous  honest and caring gesture! This is all we need in this difficult time ” he says. And it’s not just about just providing for the needy. “Not everyone is blessed enough to donate monetarily. The least we can do is to stay home  not endanger our own lives and others. Like the saying goes in Urdu — Miley toh phir shayed zindah nahin reh saken.. zindaa rahey to phir zaroor milengey.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-pakistani-pilot-urges-the-world-to-always-stay-united/story-accog6PDTcmnATjMM0TNgL.html
22/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Earth Day: How the planet healed during Covid-19 lockdown,The entire country is under lockdown since last one month  and nature has found a way to let Earth regain its lost wealth  during this period.,No one was sure that there would be a day  when they would see  at least in this lifetime  nature recovering after a fallow due to excessive pollution including dumping of industrial and domestic waste  irresponsible chopping of trees  and every possible abuse. But  the lockdown has turned the tables. Not just the skyline is becoming clearer with each passing day  the rivers are visibly purer  and the once endangered flora and fauna is now coming back to life. Here’s a glimpse of how the Earth has healed itself amid the lockdown.  Our Lifelines — RiversYou can see the surface of river Ganga  which could not be cleaned despite spending crores of rupees is now cleaner than ever as reportedly none of the industrial waste is being dumped in it. According to a report in HT  Ganga may be cleaner today  than it was in 1986 — the year when efforts to clean the river were first launched. And  a similar case is with Yamuna. Due to a blanket reduction in industrial pollutants  and increased discharge of water from Haryana to Delhi  a cleaner Yamuna is visible these says. Both the factors have increased the self purification capacity of the river.  READ | Ganga water cleaner than it was in 1986? Clear skies  and clearer skyline With absolutely limited movement of vehicles on the roads  most of the metro cities in India are breathing in much cleaner air with relatively safer levels of pollutants to deal with  as compared to the time before the lockdown. Metro cities have reported ‘satisfactory’ AQI  and those who had been battling smog in Delhi-NCR can vouch for it anytime! Feathers flock togetherThe news of pink flamingoes return in huge numbers to Mumbai beach is certainly something to rejoice about. The reduction in intensity of human activities at and around the city is being touted as a major reason for the possibility of flamingos to flock the city in such large numbers. The Bombay Natural History Society has stated that their number is 25% more than it was in the last year.   A Himalayan view People in Jalandhar can see Himalayas from their roof top  for the first time in decades! The lockdown has cleared the air pollution to the extent that people in Punjab could catch a sight of Himalayas from some of its cities. The Himalayan range is more than 100 miles away from Punjab  and when spotted  its sight left many in awe!

All we need is food  shelter  water  loved ones  and a healthy mind and body.” While some people continue to take the pandemic lightly  Fakhri has a word of caution for them. “Following the rules is a matter of life or death.

You almost lose touch with you you are. Now at a time like this  when we’re forced to spend time with ourselves...

But then when you slow down  you feel a little bit guilty that the world is continuing to run. But now  the whole world is on a break. Even if you want to do something  you can’t do it now.

21/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,A roti bank for ‘laddoos’: Indore’s unique endeavour for street dogs,Indorians address their street dogs as ‘laddoo’ with love; they have set up a food bank for them that makes five thousand rotis daily,A countrywide lockdown announced by the government to fight COVID-19 left the stray canines in distress. With resources less for even humans  it is a very critical time for these stray dogs as they are exposed to severe shortage of food. In a unique endeavour  Indore Municipal Corporation has set up a roti bank for stray dogs that are starving. The motivating force behind it  Vandana Jain  who runs a campaign  Dogitization in Indore  Madhya Pradesh  says  “The municipal corporation has always helped us. With their help  we created a roti bank  where we make 5 000 rotis and then we distribute it through NGOs.” Jain started Dogitization to create awareness amongst citizens of Indore to be kind and compassionate towards the street dogs. She also encouraged everyone to win the trust of the dogs and eventually send off each dog of the city to dog sterilization clinics. Vandana and her group lovingly address each stray dog as ‘laddoo’. She says  “It’s sad that humans divided themselves in upper and lower castes  and they also created levels in animals. Godmen appeal to us to worship cows  give them roti and chaara. But no one talks that about dogs. I feel till the time ‘kutta’ word is used  people will never respect this life.” So  in order to make people fall in love with the sweetest and most faithful living creature on earth  she promotes them as ‘laddoo’ instead of kutta (dog). “Everyone should try it. Speak to a dog on the street and call him laddoo and offer him food and you will see how the dog starts wagging its tail  it will make an instant bond with you ” she says. In these trying times  Jain is thankful for the support she is getting from the administration. She says  “I convinced the additional SP  Maneesha Pathak Soni to allow one toast manufacturer to also make toasts for these street dogs and she granted us the permission.” Dogitization could manage to order 1 200 kg toasts in 16 hours for hungry dogs. She says  “That goes on to show how kind this city is. Without the city’s support  we could not have done this”. We wish all the happy laddoos of Indore a healthy  happy life!,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-roti-bank-for-laddoos-indore-s-unique-endeavour-for-street-dogs/story-theQl80ytmZuG41ObKGgoK.html

Kaloo was dubbed as Superman  after the doctor shared a selfie of himself on Twitter,The health workers  first aid responders  the police and others fighting a relentless battle against COVID-19 are no less than superheroes. The social media platform Twitter  recently introduced the world to Superman aka Dr Shahnawaz B. Kaloo! Over the weekend  the microblogging platform asked the users to put up their selfies  promising to give them a “hair cut” during this lockdown. When Dr Kaloo uploaded his selfie  the social media site responded by photoshopping the doctors photo  giving him the red cape  a big S across his chest and the signature Clark Kent/ Superman hair style. You look SUPER pic.twitter.com/42z5y01wfj “That really is a great surprise. It’s not always that doctors and healthcare workers get recognised. It feels really good when people recognise your efforts ” he tells us  pleasantly surprised with all the attention he has received ever since the ‘super’ tweet. “Yes  I have received a lot of direct messages with people thanking me and other doctors and healthcare people like me. Things like these only encourage us. It’s a long fight  and we need all encouragement possible ” he says. Dr Kaloo who has been working round the clock  takes care of the patients with liver issues. “ Yes  COVID-19 patients are a big priority. But there are other critical patients as well. And they are a lot more prone to this disease  and therefore  their care is even more important ” he says  adding that while its extremely difficult for him to be with his family  especially two young kinds “ who don’t really understand what is happening”  this is what he signed up for. However  he feels heroic efforts are all being wasted because of the “fake forwards” that spread misinformation. “You know  you end up laughing on these fake news items. I read somewhere that if one consumes alcohol  it will kill corona virus. But people are reading these kind of messages and are falling for misinformation that can be dangerous ” he says. He urges everyone to be very careful and trust only the reliable sources of information on this pandemic. “Doctors know about this disease. Whatever they say should be taken seriously ” he says.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-viral/twitter-s-super-tribute-to-a-delhi-doctor/story-beVqFiukbTd59GUn8RuqNI.html
21/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Tracing post-pandemic future of styling,Stylists across the board root for an imagery realised with compassion and caution,With lockdown continuing and all the key fashion and luxury events of the year like the Met Gala and Paris Couture Week getting cancelled  a big question mark lurks on the future of fashion. With no Bollywood releases slated to happen in the coming months and all promotional tours getting nixed  it’s seemingly evident that in the post-pandemic world  styling will be far from the same. One’s keen to ask our celebrity stylists - will red carpet glamour be the thing of the past? Will fashion editorials evolve into creating imagery realised with a fresh approach to address the problems and issues facing the planet? We got a panel of style arbiters to comment. Celebrity stylist Radhika Mehra hopes that post the pandemic stylists will be more conscious  cautious and compassionate. “We as stylists should aim to promote less wastage in terms of packaging and shipping that stems from calling for endless options for a simple requirement and consciously trying in every day and in every way we can to lessen our footprint. Let’s say no to fast fashion  let’s encourage sustainability and environmental consciousness - this is the current most urgent need of the hour ” says Radhika.  A section of stylists see both editorials and red carpet appearances becoming aspirational yet relatable. Stylist Pranay Jaitly says  “We will get the opportunity to work with products produced and crafted in our own country and this would help in sustainability too. I see more designers focusing on Indian workmanship more than ever  which is a great step in times like these.” Slow-paced fashion and inclusivity will continue to rule the style ecosystem. Stylist Meagan Concessio says  “It is very difficult to predict the future  but I think it will be a while till styling is as glamourous as it used to be. Editorial fashion must reflect the way we feel right now - slow-paced  more inclusive  empathetic and rather relatable. If not  I’m not sure it will be relevant.” Meagan also sees a huge technology takeover.  According to celebrity stylist Eshaa Amiin  editorial styling will be able to bounce back faster with smaller teams at shoots unlike film shoots  which require a big crew. “More fresh digital content for editorials can keep it relevant. However  red carpet appearances and other photo-ops will take a while considering public gatherings will be a concern till the vaccine to cure Covid-19 is out. The industry will be more conscious about being responsible and not creating opportunities for celebrities to be mobbed. I see promotions happening through radio  print and digital interviews ” says Eshaa.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/tracing-post-pandemic-future-of-styling/story-FBwANBNW8ERhN7IUrUEXVJ.html

And while the current Covid-19 situation certainly is stressful  he feels that it has brought everyone together. “The police  Army  medical professionals and all of them  these are your Covid warriors  like they call them  who are actually risking their lives  specially the medics  wardboys. They all are the real-life superheroes.

It took me a couple of minutes  as it spreads the message of positivity in today’s world  which is full of negativity and hatred. I think it’s good to have something that’s positive and not controversial  still Indian at heart  which people will relate to. It will probably foster unity somewhere ” he says. Abraham is known to always be a very private person  who is only vocal on things he feels passionately about. With a lot of people divided over whether one should announce their donation amounts or not in this crisis  we pop the question to him too. He says he doesn’t prefer to announce them.

He shares  “This was scary. Someone in the business told me ‘This is your time to buy goodwill’. We are faced with a real-life situation  and it’s not time to  quote unquote  ‘buy’ goodwill. It is something I choose not to say  even if I am doing. Like I said  nothing wrong with people who have said it. Hats off to our industry  we have come together as a unit.” Life in this lockdown  as Abraham describes  has not been a “drastic change” for him. He anyway prefers “home food  comfortable in his house”. And requesting people to self-isolate themselves  he adds  “If people are expecting things to get back to the way they were  on May 4  let’s wake up and smell the coffee  nothing is going to be normal till the end of this year.

Bharucha  recalls  “When I heard about the coronavirus cases in Delhi  I got paranoid right then and self-imposed the lockdown at our home from March 7. This ended  up as a prep for us in a way. We would only step out only when we needed groceries and I stopped travelling outdoors for my shoots and meeting people.” Since then  the actor is keeping herself in self-quarantine while also spending quality time with her family. Besides  she is trying her hands at honing her culinary skills as well as all household chores. “Aisa koi kaam nahi hai ghar ka jo maine nahi kiya ho. I’ve realised going to work is a little easier than doing the household chores ” she shares.

I’m a very simple person and there’s more to me being just an actor.  Hopefully  my posts are going to pump up the mood and entertain people in some way ” she says.  At the work front  the actor was supposed to shoot for her next movie Hurdang  opposite Sunny Kaushal  towardd the end of March  but that has stalled and so has her travel plans for her 35th birthday on May 17. “I was planning to go for a trip to Australia or somewhere else with my family on my birthday in May but that also stands cancelled ” she says.  What Saturday Night preps look like in the #NewNormal 😋 #LockdownDay11 A post shared by  nushrat (@nushratbharucha) on Apr 4  2020 at 6:11am PDT While many celebrities have talked about the donations towards Covid-19 relief  Bharucha wants to maintain discretion and says  “Talking about charity is too personal. I like to do it and keep it to myself. And those who talk about it are only to inspire other people to come forward and donate.” Now that the lockdown has been extended to May 3  she feels the only way to fight this pandemic is “self-isolation in our homes and adjusting to the present scenario”. She says  “We’re at a larger loss of people’s lives  unemployment  and major businesses shutting down and we all need to fight this together. We all need to reset from this and think about what is going to be our new normal after this pandemic gets over.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/nushrat-bharucha-talking-about-charity-during-this-covid-19-crisis-is-too-personal/story-6K2z7twYLznUSJN360176K.html

People would have pulled out their own hair  quips actor Meghna Naidu  who is following the Covid-19 prevention guidelines strictly in Dubai with her Portugese husband Luis Miguel Reis. While at home  she’s balancing her time between household chores  working out  taking up some online classes  making videos for students of her own dance academy  and binge watching OTT content. And so  Naidu  well known for her Kaliyon ka Chaman video  says  “Thanks to technology  there are so many things that we have  and we can do... Imagine if this lockdown happened in no-technology time? I think people would have been bored  they would have pulled out their own hair... Technology has really saved us a lot  and has kept us busy.”  Miss being outdoor !!! We are never going to take being Outdoor for granted again 😣 #lockdown2020#lockdown#staysafe#stayhome#dubai#dubailove A post shared by  Meghna Naidu (@meghnanaidu1) on Mar 31  2020 at 6:13am PDT It has been over four weeks since she’s “locked down”  and Naidu has already finished a ‘life coaching’ course. Next up  she’s looking at pursuing an online fitness course  and feels “it’s the best thing to do something productive and keep your mind occupied” during such a time. As for her dance school which she recently reopened in Dubai  she says she sends one video a week to her clients  making sure she uses the power of technology to the T. Ask her if she’s consuming OTT content  she exclaims  “Oh my God  I don’t think I’ve watched so much TV in my whole life! I have binge watched shows for four hours on some days. Also  my husband is not much of a TV person. He is more into reading. But he has actually surprised me by sitting with me and binge watching shows.”  Kaliyon ka chaman !!!

Another plan that went haywire due to the lockdown for the 39-year-old was that of a white wedding! The actor  who had a hush-hush wedding which she opened up about only last year  two years after tying the knot  says  “We’ve been planning the white wedding for a while now. But now  this year  we had our flights booked for Portugal in May. Louis’ parents were not present for our Indian wedding  and this time  we thought when we’ll go to Portugal  we’ll go to the church and do something. That was in the plan  and then coronavirus hit. We’ve made up our minds now that we won’t plan. Like last time  we will do a ‘Chat mangni pat byah’.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/meghna-naidu-imagine-if-this-lockdown-happened-in-no-technology-time-people-would-have-pulled-out-their-own-hair/story-3Cul4edbLKZexeSAEBpvmM.html

19/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,france;india;japan;oman,Lockdown: Not a hindrance to designer’s creativity,The lowdown on how designers are gearing up for the coming seasons,The FDCI-led LMIFW (which was slated to be held in New Delhi in March) got cancelled in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Internationally  Met Gala  cruise shows for global brands like Gucci and Prada  besides the Paris Couture week have been put off the fashion calendar given the grim reality of coronavirus. However  this is the best time to let one’s creative flag fly high  reignite one’s imagination  put one’s pencil to the sketch pad and conjure a fashionable future. When the going gets tough  the tough get stylish. Sunil Sethi  Chairman  FDCI recalls  “I was very disappointed to read that Met Gala (which was slated to be held in May) and Paris couture week got cancelled besides the Olympics. If they are not happening  you could well imagine my plight as I have just postponed one season.” Mr Sethi is still holding his bookings at the Taj Hotel in New Delhi for India Couture Week slated to be held in July. He adds  “My personal wish is to come out of this gloom with flying colours. India Couture week will be great for customers at large by July end. According to me  it’s too early to cancel that as well.”  Being someone who always sees the glass half full  Mr Sethi hopes that the three month-long time duration is good enough duration to recover. “I am hoping that Indian couture doesn’t leave this opportunity to create some magical pieces at their studio by working at home. I hope our designers churn out new ideas everyday. We are praying that the couture week takes place and designer should be ready to hit the market with their new lines when the season starts. Let’s use this time to let one’s creative process realise one’s full potential. Since the government has allowed partial work in factories  designers should utilise this time to the best of their ability ” Mr Sethi advises.  Adapt and watch buying patterns  Couturier Anamika Khanna says  “These are uncertain times and no answer can be perfect. Most of us will have to adapt and adjust as we go along  not just production plans  but also wait and watch buying patterns. At this moment  I’m letting the creative juices flow freely and not binding myself down to anything  it’s more about creativity just for its own sake. Having said that  there are numerous thoughts on repricing  and about the fact that timelessness and quality will be of supreme importance.”Currently  Anamika is working on a second edition of the AK OK collection  which will comprise of easy and relaxed pieces. “Regarding the wedding season  it is very difficult to set anything in stone  as one is not sure how the weddings will pan out. The weddings of course have all got postponed and even if they do happen  may not be large affairs. One definitely needs to rethink as it comes. Work at the moment for the artisans is also at a halt. Partial permissions for our factories are not effective as yet  as we don’t fall in the certain required categories  along with the fact that the artisans are all in their hometowns and are not able to travel yet. We are happy to comply with whatever it needs to stay safe and keep everyone around safe  so for now  it’s work from home ” adds Anamika.  Time for rigorous research  Designer Rahul Mishra is focusing his energies on rigorous research and development for the next collection. “With help of available technology  our design team is working on new techniques and applications that should assist us in creating a significant amount of employment for local craftsmen right after we resume. This purpose of ours that helps us delve deeper into our brand philosophy  shall be fulfilled with garments that are made with couture sensibilities. While we like to believe that our designs are relevant to a woman in India  Japan or France equally  we’re hoping to create a collection with a variety of silhouettes and styles. The creative stimuli is high and we are aiming to create our best ever work through this otherwise difficult time.”  He adds  “We are working towards creating our best collection so far  in terms of the aesthetic and emotional value. We aim for our clothes to be a response to the crisis with rays of positivity  hope and beauty. All those who’s weddings have been postponed due to the lockdown  shall be looking to tie a knot some time after but  with new sensibilities towards relationships and luxury. We are aiming to create fashion with ultimate craftsmanship and more inclusivity along with a human touch of personal emotions. While we are aware that several of our workers shall be looking forward to resuming work as soon as possible  many of them reside in localities that are still volatile. There can be a larger risk to their personal health if the workspaces are reopened without suitable planning. Our team is working on the management of resources and upgrading our safety measures before they can open for work. Even if we do  we’re hoping to at first  produce cloth masks to contribute to the government before we begin with our production. Difficult times such as this tend to demand aptitude for both  compassion and business.” Planning for seasons ahead Designer Sonam Modi of label SVA is currently ideating on how to move forward post the lockdown. “We are working towards the upcoming season. The autumn winter festive line  and a bridal collection are in the pipeline. Our factories are not operational yet  as the places that are artisans stay are in containment. But we hope as soon as the lockdown ends  things will pick up pace. Production will resume  and we have planned to first complete all orders that were stopped due to the lockdown  and then continue with development of new styles for the festive lines ” says she.  Pocket-friendly bridal pieces  Designer Nikita Mhaisalkar has decided to launch a classic and easy-on-pocket range for brides-to-be and their families comprising mostly of separates. “These pieces shall be classic and minimal. We have chalked out a plan where with minimal physical contact  we will be distributing raw materials and sketches to the masters and embroiderers. We plan to do video sessions once a day with karigars and explain them the work which needs to be done so they stay on the same page in terms of production.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/lockdown-not-a-hinderance-to-designer-s-creativity/story-Fnji33Zu0HX6pwHUr9GvJJ.html

Temporarily dysfunctional airports  gyms and almost all public places have obviously barred celebrity spotting and consequently  the flow of any new content for paps. Viral Bhayani  one of the most well-known names in the business  reveals that the situation is indeed not good. “I am still completely busy right from morning and it hasn’t changed much for me ” he confesses  “However  financially it has been very bad for my boys (in the team). I had to raise money from celebrities. Some have actually come forward and started calling me ‘If you want money  we will help you out’. Help is pouring in from all quarters.”  In hard times the film industry is hit so bad and one man who has come forward and helped the Cine employees with his donation has also now gone an extra mile to help the paps. Our hertfelt gratitiude to #RohtiShetty for supporting the families of paparazzi photographers by directly sending out payments to their bank accounts. We all wishing #rohitshettypicturez and #Sooryavanshi a roaring success. #rohitshetty 🙏 @itsrohitshetty @rohitshettypicturez #viralbhayani @viralbhayani A post shared by  Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Apr 15  2020 at 10:28pm PDT Actor Hrithik Roshan is one of them to have deposited money into these photographers’ accounts. Bhayani adds  “I have told ‘no’ to many of them  I am not greedy for money  but it’s just that my boys should not (suffer). Hrithik has helped  and even some of my social media followers said we will give and help you with whatever you want.” This indeed shows that the industry has come together to help each other in these tough times. Manav Manglani  another popular paparazzi  says filmmaker Rohit Shetty too has helped them. “Most of our photographers are from far-off states. They come to learn  and then we hire them. Most of them are selfie-seeking guys  who want to take this up as work too. A lot of such people work on a monthly salary of Rs 10 000-15 000. And some have not been able to go back to their villages and towns in this lockdown ” Manglani tells us.

It was a good gesture  why would we say no. I’m also paying my boys their salaries and have told them ‘koi tension nahi hai  agle 2-3 mahine tumhari salary aayegi’. But how much can they do with this salary. In a situation like right now  it’s enough ” says Manglani. With no new celeb spotting  paparazzi are digging photos from their archives and they say it’s to take their mind off the ‘depressing’ news about Covid-19. “I have tons of content  but I’m getting a little bored also. When you see all these pics  you feel giddy  so there has to be some gap. Also  it is all becoming too much. I’m not watching anything else much apart from news  you are so hooked on to it.

18/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Few days into the lockdown  Maanvi Gagroo reveals having a bit of a breakdown and panic attack,Actor Maanvi Gagroo got quite upset upon seeing the news about the migrant workers  and started crying  and spiralled out of control. And her family and friends helped her calm down.,Actor Maanvi Gagroo has always been independent  and lives alone in her Mumbai house  too. She counts that experience coming in handy in this lockdown situation due to the spread of coronavirus. “I had started self-isolating much before the lockdown began. I think  in general also  artistes are a little used to isolation  as we have time between projects or shots  when we need to be by ourselves to figure things out. Even on set  there’s so much chaos going on. We consciously or sub-consciously train ourselves to be isolated or comfortable in solitude ” says Gagroo. Besides  she adds being “fond of her house and staying indoors” and that’s why her initial reaction to the lockdown was of “utter relief”. She further quips  “Usually  when I am at home spending time with myself  I feel guilty.” However  the stress over the enormity situation did get to her  and she reveals she had a panic attack after the initial days.

I spoke to my family and friends  they calmed me down. It was a bit of a panic attack  but I soon felt calmer.” While the actor had the luxury of procrastinating over things before the lockdown  she has realised that she has to do all that work now anyway  since she is all by herself. “I don’t have the option of sitting and brooding anymore  I get up and do chores. Actually having become more disciplined about my workouts now… earlier I would say ‘I can’t go to the gym today’ or tell my trainer let’s do it tomorrow. But now there’s no excuse  I can even work out at three in the night!

According to the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Friday  the state has given permission for all urgent pre-monsoon works.  It has also decided to allow industries to operate in all rural areas of the state; manufacturing and other industrial establishments in special economic zones; industrial townships in non-containment areas  except Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune Municipal Corporation limits. It has further allowed construction activities of roads  buildings and irrigation projects outside the municipal corporation limits.  “The state government is opening up major areas from the lockdown. This is the beginning of economic recycle ” said a senior government official. Meanwhile  after 25 days of lockdown  the case count of coronavirus in Maharashtra stood at 3 321.  On Friday  119 new cases were recorded. The death toll of the state rose to 201  with seven more deaths. Among the patients who died  five are from Mumbai and two Pune.

To make funds for health services easily available  the government also decided to allow the district administration to spend 25% of the district planning committees’ funds on Covid-19 related infrastructure. This would facilitate district administrations to spend around ₹245 crore at their level. The sub-committee also decided to give an insurance cover of ₹20 lakh to the employees from rural development department involved in Covid-19 related services. It also decided to ease restrictions on  agricultural activities and facilitate grain supply to community kitchens and selling the grapes to the wineries directly. It will also allow e-commerce delivery of all goods and commodities  including food  pharmaceuticals  medical equipment  electrical and electronic appliances. The state has also asked parents to complain to the district education officer if schools insist on paying fees during the lockdown period. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the announcement. “We have issued a circular asking schools not to ask for fees considering the current situation. However  I’m getting several messages from parents across the state alleging that schools still asking for fees to be paid. We urge the parents to register their complaints with the concerned district education officer so that the circular can be implemented in letter and spirit ” Gaikwad said  in a video message on Friday. The circular of the school education department was issued on March 30. With the support of the state government  a telemedicine helpline was also started from Friday. The helpline will let people to know if they are infected or not  guide them about the epidemic and will also clear their doubts  if any. All this will be done with the help of expert doctors. ”A person will only have to call on 9513615550. The interactive voice screening system will ask 3-4 questions to the person based on the replies  it will be routed to the relevant doctor who will call back the person and guide him after taking more details ” said Kartik Sahoo from Maharashtra State Innovation Society.

The state government has also allowed cane cutters who have migrated from one district to another for work within the state to return to their villages. There are over 1.31 lakh cane cutters who are stuck in other districts due to lockdown and are currently staying at 38 sugar factories. The order that was issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta states  “The sugar factory owners will have to make all the travel arrangements to drop them at their respective villages. Prior to this  the cane cutters have to go through medical check-up for symptoms of pneumonia  cough  cold and fever.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-govt-readies-to-partially-lift-curbs-as-cases-rise-to-3-321/story-3GQDddP49YJof2Ip95KAjO.html
18/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Lockdown woes: Worried about her mental health  Shweta Basu Prasad sought help from her therapist,Actor Shweta Basu Prasad focuses on the importance of seeking help when one feels dejected and lost in times like Covid-19 crisis.,Being cooped up inside the house for so many days at a stretch is not easy and cant bog anyone down. And hence  Shweta Basu Prasad says with so much uncertainty pertaining to the future  it’s obvious for people to feel dejected and lost. The actor feels this is the time when people should seek help  something that she herself is doing. “All my life  I had lived with people — first my parents and then I was married (she split from her husband Rohit Mittal in December 2019). I’ve been living on my own since then as I needed some time by myself. And then this (coronavirus pandemic) happened ” she says  admitting that though it has been difficult  she is trying to keep herself busy. “I spoke to my therapist and asked if we could do a session over video call. I’m really worried about my mental health and I don’t want to lose sanity at such a time ” shares the 29-year-old calling online therapy sessions “a reality right now”  and she recommends it to anyone who is feeling anxious by the current situation.  I didn’t know what else to say  so I wrote this down. Couldn’t think of a better way to express what I am feeling right now. Please take care ❤️ #corona #coronavirus #covid_19 #indiafightscorona A post shared by  Shweta Basu Prasad (@shwetabasuprasad11) on Mar 23  2020 at 11:06am PDT “My therapist told me that a lot of people are indeed seeking it. I started therapy in December. I’ve had two sessions and then I was completely fine. But now  recently  I’ve been feeling uneasy again  and that’s when I reconnected with my therapist. Mental health is paramount. We must focus on mental health at these times ” she explains. Another way  the Makdee (2002) actor feels can help people ward off negativity is by staying away from social media and phones. “I’ve started a detox from my phone. I don’t use it all the time. There’s so much uncertainty  it can easily take a toll on your mental health ” she asserts. Prasad also misses her family  but they’ve devised a way to see one another even during this lockdown situation. “The other day  my mother and brother came to my building but since they can’t come up  I went down to meet them. We were standing five feet away and could meet for just 10 minutes. It was so difficult because I couldn’t even hug my mother. I think it is really getting tough. I just pray and hope this passes soon ” the actor says.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/lockdown-woes-worried-about-her-mental-health-shweta-basu-prasad-sought-help-from-her-therapist/story-qUVJiXhZFpLxF6ZRHTtzuM.html

But while she’s in India  she did contemplate going to Sweden to be with her family. “I had to quickly take a call ” she confesses  “whether I should travel back home or not. I was in a serious conversation with my dad  who told me it’s better I don’t travel. We didn’t know what the scene was like  and hence didn’t want to take chances.

The actor urged people to stand by these foot soldiers that toil to keep the Himalayas clean and sustainable. In her post  she talks about an NGO  Waste Warriors that cleans up the mountains in Dharamshala  Himachal. “They manage the waste around the Corbett Tiger reserve and work with the government in Dehradun to keep our Himalayas clean and sustainable.

A post shared by  Fatima Sana Shaikh (@fatimasanashaikh) on Apr 15  2020 at 4:38am PDT It is sad that the sacrifices of these frontline warriors are forgotten and they remain unsung hero. Avinash Pratap Singh from the NGO  that has been collecting waste and also providing relief to many waste pickers says  “There are many people who were daily wagers. Due to the lockdown  they have lost their livelihood  so we help them get ration and additional items such as medicines and milk.”  The NGO has four vehicles in Dehradun that collect waste everyday. In Dharamshala and Corbett  they have people on foot who collect waste door to door. There is a checklist they religiously follow before waste pickers go out to collect waste everyday to keep them safe. ”Adequate hand wash and disinfector  sanitising toilets  doors  knobs  adequate sanitisers for all  masks and gloves for workers and many other precautions ensure their safety ” he adds.

17/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Stuck amid lockdown?The show must go on  say TV actors as they shoot from home,Many TV actors have been shooting for something or the other at home  either all by themselves  or aided by their family.,With no new shoots happening due to the lockdown situation in the country  life seems to have come to a standstill for most actors. However  some clearly believe that the show must go on even if it means they’ve to do everything on their own. And the trend is gaining popularity. ACTORS TURN ALL-ROUNDERS Comedienne Bharti Singh and husband  writer Haarsh Limbachiyaa have come up with a new show  Hum Tum Aur Quarantine  which will be aired on a popular channel  and will give a sneak peek into the couple’s life.  “With whatever is happening around the world  we are trying to entertain our audience with humour. We will keep enlightening the audience on importance of staying at home  washing their hands often  practice social distancing etc ” says Bharti. Calling this series “one of its kind”  she adds  “Harsh and I  are together writing the script  improvising it  directing  shooting and even editing it. It’s a great working experience as we also have to manage our household chores.” ONE FOR SOCIAL AWARENESS The makers of Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hai! inform us that their actors also shot special bits from home  one in which they are requesting viewers to self-isolate. Producer Binaifer Kohli  though sceptical as to how shoots can be managed at home  says  “One off instance  it’s okay. Our actors have already shot some bytes where they are endorsing everyone who is helping us  including the police  and it’s been aired with the re-runs. They gave nice messages like ‘Bhabhi ji ghar par hain  aap bhi ghar par rahiye’.” Actor Hiten Tejwani has shot a short film on coronavirus that has gone as an entry at the Lockdown Festival of India  along with a music video. “It’s a tribute to doctors  nurses  police officers and many others who are relentlessly working out there for our safety ” says the actor.

The likes of Amitabh Bachchan  Alia Bhatt  Ranbir Kapoor  and Rajinikanth came together for it  titled Family.  When you see that the cause is greater than the idea you dreamt of .. there is just immense joy and gratitude for all my colleagues and friends in the making of this historic effort !

A post shared by  Amitabh Bachchan (@amitabhbachchan) on Apr 6  2020 at 10:49am PDT NEW TWIST TO OLD EPISODES Producer Rajan Shahi has already got the actors of his popular daily soaps —  Shivangi Joshi of Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai  and Shaheer Sheikh of Yeh Rishte Hain Pyaar Ke —  to shoot some special scenes at home. In the absence of new episodes  the makers are showing the old ones with a twist  where the lead characters talk to the audience offering a fresh perspective on the story. Shahi explains  “The story recap has been brought across in an interesting manner  and the actors gave the bytes themselves from their homes. We have linked them with the episodes  and it’s very nice  with the old episodes having fresh touch. Like they say  the show never ends.”  Talking about his “different” experience of shooting at home  Sheikh tells us  “I felt a little odd shooting for it  because I have to be in the character at home. I had to decide the timing and everything. It was weird to look into the camera and talk like that. We do that stuff on sets  of course  but this was something different. It was incorporated into the episodes  our reaction to basically it being re-airing.” Director Lalit Mohan  who has helmed shows such as Qubool Hai and Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon  calls this trend an “experimental phase” and believes that if it works  “we can do it in the future too  when say  actors are not getting time or technicians fall sick.” He concludes by saying  “As of now  I feel the scenes they are shooting should educate the society in some way  it shouldn’t just be for the business.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/stuck-in-this-lockdown-fret-not-the-show-must-go-on-say-tv-actors-as-they-shoot-from-home/story-EXY1K7m6MgYuuBZFgGMVaP.html

Here are a few easy tips by sustainability expert Tamanna Sharma:  Once the garbage is collected from all households  a bag of mixed waste that may contain biodegradables that will not only begin smelling awful  it will also ruin the recycling potential of pulp-based waste. So  make sure to segregate waste - one bag with wet waste  one with dry and the final one with medicinal waste.  Label your medicinal waste - sanitary pads  used masks and gloves  medicines etc - and inform the garbage collector about it.  Green waste generates nitrogen and brown waste generates carbon dioxide. All you have to do is add dry leaves and soil in an earthen pot  then put all the waste (except for meat or bones and vegetables that have oil and salt)  and cover with soil and dry leaves. Leave it aside.  You can also put vegetable peels directly in a potted plant if they are less in quantity. The nature — sun and air will do their job.  If you want to compost cooked vegetables that is old and extra  pour it into a sieve  wash it well. While washing  the spices and oil will  go off. Now  you can compost it in an earthen pot. Oil and salt will attract more insects and cause a problem.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/manage-kitchen-waste-be-a-green-warrior-actor-dia-mirza/story-KT3RWriV0arjuXbpGiiM2I.html

The actor wrote a note on his Instagram account demanding a ban on the app saying it was made for “useless people”. TikTok has been downloaded over 1.5 billion times and is extremely popular in India with many celebs having a presence on it. The app is based in China. Kushal’s note read  “While the whole world is f****d coz of China b****  but still guess what are Indians and many others are giving them the revenue from s*** #tik tok  while China made Tlk tok for people who were useless and who had nothing to do   and look at us all haha  every one is in Tlk tok  ban Tlk tok proud of never using this shit Tik tok. Ban Tlk tok.” The actor’s post got nearly 33000 ‘likes’ within a few hours. However  he disabled the comments section a few hours after the post.  Meanwhile  TV actor Vivek Dahiya is all for TikTok and shared a note about why banning the app has nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic. He shared the note on his Instagram account with the caption  “When I was asked to ban/quit using #Tiktok because it’s “Made in China”. This note answers that and beyond. #Reflections #Perspectives #Mindsets #Psychology.” The note read  “For those suggesting we should ban made In China. remember - the mobile phone you use to express your thoughts about banning an app was also assembled in the same part of the world so are 7 out of 10 products in every average household. China is branded the manufacturer of the world  whether we like it or not. Am pretty sure the founder of this app was not responsible for conspiring the Corona virus. Additionally. hydroxycioroquine used for recovery is either made In India or China. The bottom line is. we are all interdependant in this global marketplace. II one nation is a Buyer  then the other is a Seller. and both need one another to move forward. towards a single Goal of prosperity. Unless of course  we are fully self sufficient in everything but no such example exists.”  Also read: Ayesha Takia  husband Farhan Azmi offer their Mumbai hotel as quarantine facility The note ended with  “Under a nation-wide lockdown  social media is a great platform to spread messages of hope and unity.

17/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,Untraced sources of four Covid-19 patients in Chandigarh add to authorities’ worry,Teams tracing the 113 contacts of a Panjab University teacher and Chandigarh’s 19th positive case are clueless about the disease source,As the tricity remains under lockdown for Covid-19 for over three weeks now  health authorities are racing against time to come up with answers to “untraced” sources of the disease as the count of patients with no known history of contact with people from infected zones has gone up to four. Teams tracing the 113 contacts of a Panjab University teacher and Chandigarh’s 19th positive case are clueless about the disease source. As of now  the search has narrowed down to the teacher’s 64-year-old mother-in-law  who came down from Delhi to help during her daughter’s pregnancy and childbirth. The teacher who tested positive last Friday  is in the intensive care unit of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Even as his wife (32) and infant daughter are negative  the mother-in-law and elder daughter (8) have tested positive. “We have not been able to trace his source. The man has no travel or contact history ” says Chandigarh health secretary Arun Gupta. The only man with history of foreign travel the teacher had come in contact with on March 10 had tested negative. So  the “only possibility is that he might have caught infection from his mother-in-law  who came from Delhi ” Gupta adds. Contacts of teacher’s relative being tested However  even as the Chandigarh administration had written to Delhi to test the woman’s family  calling it a case of community spread would be wrong  Gupta cautions. A PGIMER based epidemiologist  however  does not agree  saying: “We are afraid this could be a case of community spread.” Indicating that there is no need to panic  the epidemiologist says other indications of community spread are not holding true for Chandigarh. “For instance  we are not finding corona positivity among patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). But  it’s worrisome if source is not found.” Sources of three more cases in Mohali that are yet to be traced include the panch of Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi  because of whom 38 more cases turned positive  pushing up Mohali district’s tally to 56  the highest in Punjab. The source of infection of the tricity’s first fatality  a 65-year-old Nayagaon man who died on March 31  also remains a mystery even though 35 of his contacts were traced. On April 7  the reports of another 78-year-old from the Mundi Kharar area of Mohali district  a woman  came out positive after her death. Only 15 of her contacts could be traced  of whom two tested positive. Markaz link “We are trying our best to find the primary source  but have not been able to do so ” says Dr Manjit Singh  civil surgeon  Mohali. “ As far as the panch of Dera Bassi is concerned  we are suspecting that he came in contact with a worker who in turn came in contact with one of the attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi last month  but we have not confirmed this yet ” he adds. Apart from the four  the Panchkula health department is also struggling to trace the source of infection of the a 44-year-old woman living in the city’s Sector 15  who tested positive on Tuesday  following which eight of her family members were also infected.

17/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Band Swaarag has released a fun song on Covid-19 to reduce the stress,,Indo-Western fusion band Swaraag has decided to use this time of lockdown productively. They have come up with a fun song to reduce the stress that has been bothering people due to the outbreak of Covid-19. The song titled Ja Ja Re Corona Virus has a Rajasthani folk touch to it and the video of the song has been shot at home. The lyrics of the song which say haath dhote dhote haath laal hogaye hai  corona se bachao is a fun take on the corona scare. “We have been listening to the news and instructions that say wash your hands regularly  don’t be part of large groups  etc. Now  we are artistes and we are used to being in large groups and practising  and our songs represent Indian culture  so until we make a mahaul  we don’t find peace. Therefore  when we were given such restrictions it was difficult to get used to them  so this song came out of those discussions and that pain which we have represented in a fun way in our song ” says Asif Khan  lead singer of Swaarag. 4 members of the otherwise seven-piece band have made this song and shot it in their home with whatever limited resources were available to them. “Since there were no professional videographers available due to the lockdown  we thought let’s shoot the video of this song on our phones since everything is possible on phones nowadays. We did face problems like lighting and quality of production but it turned out fine. We made a little space in our small room and shot whatever best we could. The audience has liked it but the video could have been shot better ” adds Mohammad Seif Ali  who plays the tabla in the band. On their routine during the lockdown  Asif says  “Of course  we have been asked to stay at home and we should  but since we are not used to this  bore toh ho hi jaate hai. Everyday  we brothers take music lessons from our dad  we go live on social media  we have dedicated some time to yoga  meditation  some time to riyaaz and we spend some time with family as well. So that’s the routine.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/band-swaarag-has-released-a-fun-song-on-covid-19-to-reduce-the-stress/story-NPf5EZpWdlrekUC6E0tJZL.html
16/04/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,IIT-K  SGPGIMS jointly develop safer alternative to N-95 masks,Prof Gupta of SGPGIMS said  “This is just the prototype. We have applied for patenting of the design of the product. A lot of refinement will be done in due process of time.”,In an effort aimed at providing a much safer alternative to N-95 masks  which are being used by people in large numbers to protect themselves from corona virus infection  Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT-K) and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS)  Lucknow  have jointly developed a working prototype of a positive pressure respirator system (PPRS).  Professor Nachiketa Tiwari (IIT Kanpur)  and professor Devendra Gupta  in-charge  Covid-19  ICU SGPGIMS  Lucknow have led the innovation. “While the existing N95 respirator does not protect the user if there is an imperfect seal between the mask and the face  as there is negative pressure inside the mask. In contrast  the PPRS provides uncontaminated air because it uses positive pressures. Thus  contaminated air from the room cannot enter the PPRS even in presence of leakages ” professor Tiwari said. “The PPRS is better placed vis-à-vis N95 respirator in one more way. The N95 respirator is only 95% efficient. Thus  health professionals working in isolation wards with large number of Covid-19 infected patients may fall sick due to exposure to significant viral loads. The PPRS eliminates this risk as well ” Tiwari added. Prof Gupta of SGPGIMS said  “This is just the prototype. We have applied for patenting of the design of the product. A lot of refinement will be done in due process of time.” “The PPRS is essentially made up of a snug  comfortable and leak-proof transparent enclosure for mouth and nose which receive positive pressure air from a portable  light  and wearable air-bottle as well as a trolley-mounted large cylinder ” said Gupta. “The device can deliver uncontaminated air for over six hours. It uses locally producible reliable one-way valves to avoid the inflow of contaminated air ” he said. The new PPRS is simple  rugged and incorporates multiple design features to protect the user. It is a universal  i.e. one-size-fits-all  design. It uses easily available local materials for fabrication.  “And finally  it can be produced locally as it uses commonly available skill sets. Thus  such PPRS devices can be produced in very large numbers in a very short time frame across the country ” the IIT-K professor said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-kanpur-lucknow-institute-develop-alternative-to-n95-masks/story-uveeaisH5VgLLHubL9p73I.html
16/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,Know how women are at more risk from the Corona virus pandemic,The virus can affect any human being of any age group  but women are more at risk of catching Coronavirus. Here’s why,Coronavirus has now made its way to almost every part of the world. People didn’t take it seriously until the outbreak turned into a pandemic. CDC and WHO are releasing proper guidelines and risk factors associated with COVID-19. As the virus is spreading exponentially  some health experts are concerned about women’s health and the risk they might have from the virus. Women in the health department  like nurses  doctors  or any other department  e.g. news reporters  anchors are working 24x7. These working women could be at more risk of catching the infection as they come in contact with a lot of people daily. Let’s take a look at the risk factors of Coronavirus on women. The virus can affect any human being of any age group  but women are more at risk of catching Coronavirus. The primary three reasons are listed below: Percentage of women working in health care departments is more compared to that of men Though the percentage of male coronavirus patients is higher than females  the study shows that more than 70% of healthcare workers worldwide are women. Nurses  female doctors  pharmacists are working day and night to take care of COVID-19 patients. Every day  several Coronavirus patients are reporting to hospitals. Therefore  more female healthcare experts are coming in contact with these patients. This could put women in the healthcare facilities at more risk to catch the infection. Immunity And physical changes in pregnant women could be infection-prone  Keeping proper distancing and hygiene is essential for everyone  especially for pregnant women.  Pregnant women  considering the changes in their physical health  need to be more cautious amid COVID-19. According to healthcare officials  if a pregnant woman is COVID-19 positive  it might cause severe respiratory illness and might complicate the pregnancy. Not to mention the stress level and changes in the immune system of a pregnant woman  which increases the risk from the Coronavirus.  Moreover  a woman who has just delivered a child could be at more risk too. Along with the newborn  a mother’s health would be more infection-prone. Therefore  it’s crucial to maintain distancing and follow proper hygiene. Women are taking care of household responsibilities while managing their careers The women working in hospitals or police departments come home after working hours to look after their families. Working in hospitals to help patients to recover and then handling regular housework increases the stress level. As health care women come in contact with more patients each day  this could expose them to the infection.  The majority of the working women or homemakers spend their whole day with the family. As schools and offices are closed  women tend to spend more time with the kids at home while managing the house. These overwhelming tasks can become reasons behind the increase in stress leading to depression.  Work stress  house chores stress  mental health  anxiety can affect the immune system of women. Moreover  coronavirus consequences can hyperactivate the fear center of the human brain. This increases the risk of catching the virus infection.  This is why taking care of your health regularly during quarantine is very important. Talking about health safety  some expert doctors like Dr. Rahil Chaudhary at Eye7 Chaudhary Eye Center in Delhi came up with an idea of treating patients via video conference for a limited time and educating them about COVID-19. The team is providing online consultation sessions to the patients for regular eye care  answering health-related questions  and keeping track of the patient’s health.  The primary aim is to educate patients about symptoms along with prevention solutions to keep them safe from signs like conjunctivitis  which is closely related to eyes  fiver  tiredness  dry cough  and more.  This Delhi eye care center is also providing medication at doorstep if needed. Which means people won’t have to leave home for treatments or for purchasing medicines.  The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe consequences; some countries are still suffering. The virus is responsible for cancelling all major or minor events  closing workspaces and schools  affecting the economy  and affecting the health of people.  Staying home  avoiding social contacts  not going out in groups will help to fight against Coronavirus.  Disclaimer: This is a company press release .

15/04/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Govt agencies gear up to restart construction work in Delhi,The decision to allow “in-situ” construction (where the workers stay on the premises) has come as a relief to several Delhi government agencies because several infrastructure projects have been stuck since last November  when construction activity was banned due to high air pollution levels in the city.,Construction work on several major infrastructure projects in the capital may resume next week  after the Centre on Wednesday granted conditional approval for such activity in areas where there were no coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment zones and if labourers were available on-site. The decision to allow “in-situ” construction (where the workers stay on the premises) has come as a relief to several Delhi government agencies because several infrastructure projects have been stuck since last November  when construction activity was banned due to high air pollution levels in the city. That ban was lifted on February 14  only to be reimposed when the national lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the lockdown till May 3  but some activities have been permitted to kick-start the economy and provide job opportunities to daily-wage labourers. Though the availability of workers may be a challenge because several thousand migrant workers left the city for their towns and villages after the lockdown was announced  and work may proceed at a slow pace  several big projects are set to resume  according to multiple officials aware of the developments. “The available labour is not enough to move the projects at the desired pace. So it is likely that initially the work will be slow. Plus  we will also have to see how to get material as the factories are also shut ” said a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official who asked not to be named. But  the official added  enough labour is available to kick-start some key projects -- the tunnel that is a part of the Pragati Maidan redevelopment plan  the Barapullah-3 elevated road near Sarai Kale Khan  the Yamuna basin near Mayur Vihar-1  the Shashtri Park and Seelampur flyovers in north-east Delhi  and the Benito  Juarez Road underpass near South Campus of the Delhi University. Government agencies on Wednesday began assessing the inventory of construction material and labour availability  a second PWD official said.  NBCC (India) Limited  which is carrying out construction work at Pragati Maidan and other central government projects  said it will start the work with whatever is available.  Its chairman and managing director  PK Gupta said: “We have projects ongoing at several locations in Delhi. We are assessing the situation and will be able to start work from April 20 at a number of places  as we have labour force available on our construction sites. We shall start work with construction material available at site and should be able to get required construction material from other places also as per the guidelines issued by government.” Workers on the Pragati Maidan project are staying at a camp near the site. The project  which started in July 2017  is scheduled to be completed at the end of the year.  The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said the availability of workers was not an issue because it was taking care of more than 3 500 stranded labourers at various locations across Delhi-NCR. “DMRC can resume construction activities after April 20 if the [Delhi] government allow it. We have the workforce available. Limited construction material/machinery are available at the sites for immediate resumption of work. However  adequate availability of all these materials in the long run may depend on the relaxation of lockdown guidelines post May 3  2020 ” said Anuj Dayal  executive director  corporate communication  DMRC. DMRC started the construction work on its Phase-IV network in Haiderpur Badli Mor on December 31.  The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) said that it is assessing the situation and is likely to resume work at 10 of its housing sites. “We will start the work with whatever material is available on the site ” said Tarun Kapoor  DDA vice-chairperson. There were a total of 1 578Covid-19 cases in the Capital on Wednesday  and 56areas in the city have so far been declared “containment zones”  where the curbs are more stringent  all movement in banned  and essential supplies are home-delivered by the government.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-agencies-gear-up-to-restart-construction-work-in-delhi/story-PYxc80TGasHZyYvKtgkiEM.html

15/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Celebs posting donation photos and videos amid lockdown: An act of humanity or to seek publicity?,Soon after TV actor Jay Bhanushli tweeted against those posting videos while donating food to the underprivileged  many felt that they were aimed at Paras Chhabra and Mahira Sharma.,Actor Jay Bhanushali’s recent series of tweets calling out those who post photos and videos while distributing food to the underprivileged  has started a debate — is it to motivate others or to get more mileage out of it? Sorry to say but distributing food to needy has become a PR stunt for lot of so called actors..if you really want dua/blessing from them or God pls leave you phones home..could see ppl not being comfortable with cameras around. #COVIDIDIOT #lockdowneffect #HumanityFirst If you really want to spread the message of helping poor click pics just with the stuff you are going to donate.pls dont click the pics and make videos with people..sad very sad disappointed at this time ppl want to gain publicity #COVIDIDIOT #lockdowneffect Maine toh kisika bhi naam nahi liya lekin tweet machines udta teer apne pechwade mein le liye 😂😂😂 guys there are many actors who are doing such cheap PR publicity..football ki language mein- players dont hit a own goal kisike bhook ka mazzak mat udao neki kar dariya mein dal While Bhanushali’s tweets did raise a pertinent question  many felt that they were aimed at Chhabra and Sharma in particular. “It’s a pity when someone makes publicity out of someone’s helplessness. You can click pictures with the stuff you are donating but poor people’s name and identity should be kept secret because not everyone who’s receiving food packets is a beggar ” Bhanushali tells us. Agreeing to his viewpoint  actors Kushal Tandon and Adaa Khan  too  shared an artwork on their Instagram story showing a man taking a selfie while giving food packets to a poor family.  So finally we both decided to help and distributing essential food packages to the under privileged with the guide lines issued by WHO- wearing a mask and practicing social distancing 😊@officialmahirasharma #paraschhabra #actor #bollywood  #biggboss #films #television #corona #entertainment #stayhome  #pandemic #covid19 #narendramodi #primeminister #initiative #candles #light #biggboss13 #colors #abrakadabra A post shared by  Paras Chhabra™ (@parasvchhabrra) on Apr 7  2020 at 6:09am PDT Talking about this whole debate  Khan opines that identity of the person receiving help should never be revealed. “It isn’t right for celebs to flaunt such things on social media. If they do this to inspire others  then one can endorse instead  as a lot of people do listen to celebs. It’s a subjective decision that a celeb should carefully take ” she elucidates. Tandon on his part is simply against the idea of filming when one is helping someone. “Some people have made it an event and their PRs make sure that the actors are coming well in the frame. It isn’t a pleasant sight at all. Doing it at an NGO or a relief fund is different as you are not filming people ” he says. Many actors have donated to various Covid-19 relief funds. Actor Arjun Bijlani  who donated Rs five lakh each to PM-CARES fund and CMO’s fund  feels that  “if a person is posting a video donating food to someone with the intention of publicity  it’s totally uncalled for. The intent should be to inspire others.” On the other hand  some continue to feel that if they can influence more people through their social media  what’s the harm? Clearing her stance  Sharma tells us  “For me  donating basic essentials is a gesture to show that I care for all those who are helpless at this time  all those who are unable to support their families. I’m using my social media to encourage and motivate people. If I’m sitting in a position where I can influence and inspire millions to do good  then why not.”  Income has fallen or been cut off completely for some people. If you guys can help please help but take all the precautions while doing it. These are dark times but we need to support our country and the people who need us . Stay safe  stay happy ..😊😊#princenarula #privika #gocorona #help #needy #food #safty #instagram #instadaily #instahelp #encouragement #love #india A post shared by  Prince Yuvika Narula (@princenarula) on Mar 28  2020 at 8:50am PDT Echoing similar sentiment  Narula says his sole intention while donating those food packets was to use his social media platform to inspire his followers to do the same. “If people think that it is a show-off or publicity  I don’t care. Even if 20 people get inspired by this and donate  mera show off safal ho jayega. This is the right time to show off and especially those who have a huge following  should do the same and not use it just for brand promotions. That’s how you’ll do some good and not just sit and talk about it. And it’s not that I’m filming every single person I’m donating to. Every second or third-day  Yuvi (wife  Yuvika Chaudhary) and I go out and donate but we don’t make a video of it ” Narula maintains.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/celebs-posting-donation-photos-and-videos-amid-lockdown-an-act-of-humanity-or-to-seek-publicity/story-qtKmrJMHuPDaCvmhW8JCbK.html
14/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Kanpur’s first Covid death after 50-year-old mutwalli tests positive,A 50-year-old Mutwalli (trustee or caretaker) of a prominent mosque who died at the Covid-19 ward of LLR hospital on Monday was confirmed positive for Corona virus.,A 50-year-old Mutwalli (trustee or caretaker) of a prominent mosque who died at the Covid-19 ward of LLR hospital on Monday was confirmed positive for Corona virus  according to chief medical officer Ashok Shukla. This is the first Covid death reported from Kanpur. He was admitted to a private hospital after his condition deteriorated on Friday after which he was shifted to the LLR hospital on the insistence of district magistrate Brahmdev Ram Tiwari and SSP Anant Deo. The samples taken at the hospital were sent to SGPGI  which sent back the report on Tuesday  a day after his death. ​ “The private hospital has been sealed and will be sanitised. The hospital staff would also be screened  the DM said. The man had a travel history to Mumbai and had hosted ‘jamaats’ at the mosque. His family was screened on Tuesday at his house in Colonelganj. His burial took place in a graveyard close to Eidgah.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kanpur-s-first-covid-death-after-50-year-old-mutwalli-tests-positive/story-dDxPO4fi2vUfg9nt7oVljM.html
14/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,Agra toll 3; sole reason for death in all cases not Covid-19,Two more women who had tested positive for COVID-19 died in Agra  taking the toll to three.,Two more women who had tested positive for COVID-19 died in Agra  taking the toll to three. With four new patients testing positive  the number of positive cases rose to 142. On Monday alone  35 cases tested positive  taking the number to 138. With identification of four more positive cases  the number rose to 142. Both the women were admitted at a hospital near Bhagwan Talkies crossing  one of the hotspots with over 20 infected staff and contacts. Last week  a woman who also had asthma had died of coronavirus infection. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh  while confirming the two deaths  said all three deceased were aged women. “The first woman who died was 76-year-old and patient of asthma. She got the infection from her grandson who had returned from Netherland. She was brought here under critical condition. She was on support of steroid and oxygen. Cardiac arrest was assigned as the cause of death ” said the DM. “Another woman who died on Monday was 48-year-old. She was already admitted to the hospital near Bhagwan Talkies as a brain hemorrhage patient. She had large intra cerebral hemorrhage leading to raised intracranial tension which required ventilator support. As such COVID-19 cannot be assigned as sole cause of death because in such type of cases of primary disease  mortality is very high ” said the DM. “Mortality rate of Intra cerebral hemorrhage is as high as 44% in the first month and 75% in the first 24 hours so assigning this death because of corona virus is not justified ” said the DM. “The third patient was having carcinoma lung with kidney failure  both leading to decreased immunity and super infection with COVID 19 ” said the DM. “In case of carcinoma lung too  mortality rate is very high and added renal failure further increased the chances of death. As such in this third case of death  COVID-19 does not seem to be the sole cause of death ” he said. With the hospital already a hotspot  samples of all these women  recuperating in intensive care unit  were sent to Lucknow’s King George Medical University (KGMU) soon after their death. The report  which came on Monday evening confirmed they both were coronavirus positive. “As per the cremation protocol  we took the sample and then handed over the bodies to their relatives ” added the DM. ​,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/agra-toll-3-sole-reason-for-death-in-all-cases-not-covid-19/story-3u6oCJVtr8gilYjFeaWduO.html

The male nurse is among the two patients discharged from PGI on Tuesday after recovering from the disease  bringing the number of active cases in the city to 12.  “I have to spend the next two weeks in home quarantine but I am eager to report back on duty. This is the time when people need us.

14/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Lockdown Diaries: Flying Around by Esther David,Earlier  birdwatching was not on the author’s list of things to do but things have changed,In the days following the announcement of a lockdown because of the corona virus in India  I would see the images of the virus relayed everywhere  so I concentrated on its design. When enlarged  this dangerous virus resembles a sculpted sphere from which a thousand poisonous starfish emerge like a crown of thorns. Why does it look like an invisible predatory piranha or sea anemone  waiting with open jaws to swallow us all? One particular day  I was shocked as I opened the newspaper and saw a photograph of a man wearing a helmet designed like the virus. He was smiling and my imagination took over  and I felt that if I were to wear this bizarre surrealistic Covid-19-shaped headgear  I would have a stroke. It scares me. Agreed  this is no time for imaginative imagery or symbolism. But I don’t have other things to do  because with just this one announcement  I felt shackled for life. So far  every single day  I would leave my house  find an auto and whizz around Ahmedabad  either on an errand or for a cup of chai in the Old City  or I would head to a café with my laptop to write. Now  instead  I had to learn to stay home. Once the housework was done  after making some chapattis  along with a little gardening in my green patch  what was I to do? I would listen to music or watch food shows on television for company  or sit ruefully in front of my laptop  trying to write an article for a food magazine  while worrying about my daughter and her family in Paris. I gave myself another task – that of writing a love story like Gabriel Garcia Marquez  ‘Love in the Time of Coronavirus’. But there was no scope for creativity either  as I was looking for essentials  which were ‘looted’ in advance and had to manage with my limited resources  even as I was given a list of phone numbers  which were not helpful. Finally  a young friend sent me all that I needed. I thanked her and told her  “It was never so bad in the worst of times  even when swarms of locusts attacked Ahmedabad  or the riots  or the earthquake.” But let’s move on to more positive things. Earlier  bird-watching was not on my list of things to do during the day. But since the lockdown  my mornings have changed  as I hear birdsong  which gives a good start to the day. Suddenly  with the absence of human beings and rumble of vehicles  if you can turn a deaf ear to the barking of stray dogs and observe the birds around you  it will bring you closer to nature. The birds around homes and housing societies are becoming daring  unafraid of coming closer. If you look carefully and listen to their calls  you will see that they are all over the place. Even squirrels are boldly running around and giving final touches to their nests in secret corners  which are woven with spun strings  shredded textiles  pieces of cotton  moss and dry grass.  The other day  a sun bird flew into my ground-floor apartment when the door was open; then feeling rather confused  it made a U-turn and flew away. A friend told me the babblers are now outnumbering the pigeons around her housing society. Crows and swallows are also seen as babblers fly around in groups or have a leisurely sand-bath in a children’s playground. And when she is in the kitchen  making her first cup of coffee  swallows fearlessly sit on her kitchen windowsill or knock on the windowpanes with their beaks and make her smile. Behind her apartment building there is an unused green zone  where a flock of black ibis roost on a tree. From her balcony  she watches the ibis and many other birds flying amidst the foliage or nesting in the trees. To continue the bird story  last week  a young friend living in a tenement opened her front door and saw a sparrow. Excitedly  she called out  “I just saw a sparrow ” as she believes sparrows are an endangered species. She quickly closed the door so as not to frighten the bird perched on a branch of the mogra creeper she had planted next to the main door. Since then  every morning  she leaves bowls of grains and water for the sparrow  so that it continues to visit her and eventually feels inspired to make a nest in the foliage of the fragrant mogra. I now spend my mornings watching the aerial gliding of sun birds  along with bulbuls  robins  mynahs  babblers and flowerpeckers. If I am lucky  I also see a stray egret or starling. Since the lockdown  in this still silence around me  I can hear the distant cries of kingfisher  coppersmith  koel and peafowl  as kites and falcons patrol the skies  looking for prey down below on earth. The other day  someone saw a common green bee-eater  a drongo and a shrike. Every morning  I study a flowering bush close to my bedroom window  disturbing a few butterflies flitting over the flowerbeds. As they disappear  I look for the nest a pair of tailor birds is making in one of the broad-leafed plants  stitching the leaves into a cozy nest for their brood. And to add colour to our surroundings  during the sleepy mid-afternoon hours  a flock of wild Indian parrots arrive to perch on a young neem tree  chattering away  maybe about the sudden silence which has descended upon a world predominantly inhabited by human beings. The closeness between wildlife and us humans is increasing. I try to decipher the hidden meaning of these birdsongs  as we have a lot to learn from nature  because as they say  “Nature is a great educator…”  Esther David is the author of Bombay Brides published by HarperCollins,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/lockdown-diaries-flying-around-by-esther-david/story-osyWFW2qMfzIsIl7WL4DCK.html

He also asked officers concerned to “take ‘strictest’ action against anyone who conceals Covid-19 infection or deliberately spreads it.” Yogi was speaking at a review meeting he held with the Covid-19 management ‘Team-11’ to review the lockdown scenario in the state.  “Under the present global scenario  the US  Japan and several other countries intend to withdraw their investments from China. This could be an opportunity for Uttar Pradesh ” said Yogi  according to a statement issued by his office.  He asked infrastructure and industrial development commissioner  principal secretary of MSME and principal secretary of industrial development to make proposals regarding this aspect. Yogi further said: “Identify anyone who hides the infection or attempts to deliberately spread it. Not only this  but also act against any district magistrate or district police chief if they commit any lapse on this count.” The chief minister  talking about the Covid-19 hotspots in the state  said testing for coronavirus must be ramped up in the hotspots. “Make categories in the hotspots and then put multiple teams to executive testing. Also  consolidate door-step delivery of essential items in the hotspots. Work so well that the people in the area get to notice the work being done for their benefit ” he said. Principal secretary  medical and health  Amit Mohan Prasad informed the chief minister that Pilibhit emerged as the first district in the state to have become a Covid-19-free district. All the coronavirus positive patients there have been cured. Yogi said that emergency and critical care should be restored in hospitals without compromising on coronavirus safety protocols.  Principal secretary  medical education Rajneesh Dubey informed that the state had only one Covid-19 testing lab on March 3  now it has 14 operational testing labs. Yogi asked him to start a lab in Mathura too soon.  Yogi asked the officers concerned to start making arrangements for sending home those persons who have completed 14-day quarantine at shelter homes. “Also  make arrangements for take-away food packets (of grains) for them before they start their homeward journey. Provide a list of such people with their names and addresses to the respective district administrations so that the administrations monitor them for their health status ” Yogi said. Taking about people from other states and countries stranded in UP  Yogi said  “Contact them and sort out their pro​blems.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-corona-impact-on-china-can-be-investment-op-for-up/story-UEd9KGCYTXSTC7kYvUZRQO.html
13/04/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,united kingdom;india;united states;china;italy;japan,Bringing citizens back could pose risk to population here: Govt tells SC,The Centre made the submission in response to a batch of petitions seeking return of Indian students stranded in the United States and the United Kingdom.,The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that evacuation of Indian students and expatriates stuck abroad amid the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease could pose a risk to India’s domestic population.  Echoing the Centre’s concerns  the bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices LN Rao and MM Shantanagouder said  “Stay where you are”. The Centre made the submission in response to a batch of petitions seeking return of Indian students stranded in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the U.K alone  there are close to 4 lakh Indian expatriates including 50 000 students. Several petitions were filed in the apex court seeking the court’s intervention for evacuation of Indian migrants stranded in the Middle East  Indian fishermen in Iran and students from the US and the UK.  The petitioners criticized the travel ban on return of citizens at a time when other countries were making arrangements to get evacuate their citizens from India.  The Centre  in its status report said that the country had evacuated citizens from China  Iran  Japan and Italy when the condition in India was not as grim.  “However  given the present situation of the corona virus outbreak in India and the available limited resources  it is not feasible to selectively evacuate Indian citizens from abroad when a large number of them from a number of countries want to return back due to various reasons ” the report by the Centre said. The Centre’s status report said that passengers from these countries are at higher risk of infection. “Travel back of such passengers to different regions of India poses a grave risk to the country of a population of over 1.3 billion.” The bench also noted the logistical constraints in arranging quarantine facilities for all returnees. It was for this reason  the Centre proposed to the Court  “The approach of the Government has  therefore  been to advise the Indian nationals to stay put where they are in line with Government’s approach to contain the further spread of the virus within India and allowing health machinery to focus on domestic containment effectively.” The government informed the court that the Indian High Commission in London is making all arrangements to ensure the well-being and safety of stranded Indian students. The Centre’s status report did not make specific averment about extension of visas of Indian students stuck in the US.  The court will hear a petition for these Indian students stranded in the US  filed by senior advocate Vibha Dutta Makhija next Monday. The court will also hear a petition seeking the return of some 860 Indian fishermen stranded on the shores of Bandar-e-Moqam and Lavan Island in Hormozgan province of Iran.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bringing-citizens-back-could-pose-risk-to-population-here-govt-tells-sc/story-ZlfVKMZjNIBKJSegWxEivJ.html

13/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Nimrat Kaur: Some people are afraid of isolation thinking this is some kind of a witch hunt,Actor Nimrat Kaur urges people to not react negatively towards health workers who’re putting their lives in danger for us and hopes that this stigmatising around the issue comes to an end.,Actor Nimrat Kaur was in between shifting her house in Mumbai and signing new projects when everything went for a toss following the Covid-19 outbreak in India. Unprepared  as many were  she was caught in the midst of thinking about herself  her mother  and 90-year-old grandmother who’re in Delhi  and her sister in Bengaluru.  “I felt as if there’s a big cloud over my head. I was unable to reprogram. I think that’s normal  but then we need to pick up the pieces  stand up and face it keeping our spirits bright ” she says. As someone who loves to play by a routine  Kaur formed a list of her day-to-day activities and hobbies  so that when she “hits the sack” at night  the sleep is “peaceful”. While recommending discipline to all  she also expresses the need for everyone to support the heath staff working on the frontline  instead of stigmatising them. “No one can react negatively towards health workers who are putting their lives in danger for us. If we don’t understand this  then God help us ” adds the 38-year-old.  There’s no better time than today to recognise what ‘health’ means for each of us. Call it a mega divine intervention or whatever else  nothing can be taken for granted here on- not our minds  not our bodies. Also because no amount is or will ever be able enough- gratitude and thoughts towards all the relentless medical health and mental well-being professionals keeping this world together right now. Happy World Health Day to all ♥️💛 #CoronaChronicles #Kaurantined #StayHome #HappyWorldHealthDay A post shared by  NIMRATasneem KAUReshi (@nimratofficial) on Apr 6  2020 at 9:20pm PDT Elaborating how this can be addressed  she shares  “Platforms should be set up to drill the right information in everyone’s mind. This isn’t a witch hunt and it’s not against anyone or the system. This awareness needs to start from the grassroots level. There’s a lot of stigmatising around the issue. It comes with a lot of shame  unnecessary burden and extreme reaction from people  who’s actually misunderstanding the issue. They’re afraid of isolation thinking this is some kind of a witch hunt. That needs to be addressed.” As for her moments of peace during this crisis  Kaur finds it in connecting with her family over video calls. Her sister Rubina  a therapist  has started a service to help people who are going through mental health issues. While Kaur is herself social media shy  she is opening up slightly through her posts in these times to spread positivity. She is helping those reaching out to her through comments or via DM. “There are two kinds of problems. One is basic existential issues  where people are worried about what their survival and then there are people who have basic necessities available but are facing the problems of the mind. Both these problems need equal attention ” she ends.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/nimrat-kaur-some-people-are-afraid-of-isolation-thinking-this-is-some-kind-of-a-witch-hunt/story-y8FomlptL4oFDRLdvpkTfK.html
12/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Covid-19: Doctor-at-doorstep scheme launched to help Pune’s needy,Called Doctor at your doorstep  the initiative is aimed at residents of slums  homeless shelters and old age homes.,For Vilas Rathod  65  the humanitarian crisis brought about by the Covid-19 global pandemic is nothing  he hasn’t seen before. In September 1993 when the Latur earthquake struck Maharashtra killing over 9000 people  Rathod was among the first lot of relief workers to reach the site to provide assistance. The enormity of that tragedy became evident when relief workers like Rathod saw the situation first-hand. “What I saw was devastation all around and the only thing on our mind was to first provide food for those displaced and help them.”  At the time  Rathod was part of the Maharashtriya Jain Sanghatana which later became the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS) — a collective of volunteers established in 1985 to do social work  but primarily focused on issues pertaining to the Jain community. Having become familiar with relief work over the last 30 years — the organisation helped rebuild 335 schools after the Bhuj quake in Gujarat in 2001 — Rathod approached  Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram for permission to launch mobile dispensaries after the 21-day national lockdown was announced. “We created a programme along with the Pune Municipal Corporation and Force Motors to launch mobile clinics/ambulances on 1 April ” Rathod said. Called Doctor at your doorstep  the initiative is aimed at residents of slums  homeless shelters and old age homes. With most private physicians closing their clinics  and government dispensaries spending all their available resources on fighting the coronavirus  these mobile clinics have begun to cater to at least 2 500 people daily. For this initiative  15 buses and tempos were retrofitted within 24 hours and turned into mobile clinics and makeshift ambulances. The front seats were removed to make space for a stretcher and for doctors to move inside. A loud speaker system has also been fitted to communicate with the public on essential medicines for those with symptoms of cough  cold and running nose. Four mobile clinics were introduced in the Pimpri Chinchwad industrial township on April 5; more have  been made available in Solapur and Nashik. The organisation recently received permission to introduce this service across the whole state.  “Our aim is to have  100 such ambulances in Maharashtra ” Rathod said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-at-doorstep-scheme-launched-to-help-pune-s-needy/story-4XQCsNrRoHKAwKs6GX24CK.html
12/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,The solace of poetry on Easter during the pandemic,A meditation on how a poem by WB Yeats  written after WW1  acquires new life in these times of COVID-19,How are you keeping yourself together in these strange times? Three weeks into a pandemic-induced lockdown  my coping strategy is to engage with more poetry and less information. I may not be able to tell you the death toll for the day but I manage to keep myself sane on most days. Poets speak to me in the language of myth and metaphor  and this shift from the literal frees me up from narrativizing the present in unhelpful ways. I like to participate in the world not only through cold  critical reasoning but also through a more intuitive kind of knowing that might be difficult to articulate. This balance serves me well. The arrival of Easter reminds me of The Second Coming  a stunning poem by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. The title refers to a Christian belief about the return of Jesus Christ after he ascended to heaven almost 2000 years ago. This poem from 1920 seems particularly poignant now because Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus after his crucifixion  and the theme of renewal is also what our current crisis points towards.  Studying at a Roman Catholic school in suburban Mumbai introduced me to Jesus early in life. Every classroom had a crucifix  so the sight of his bleeding body suspended from a cross was not alien to me. However  the idea of one person atoning for the sins of all humanity and leading them to redemption was beyond my comprehension. What warmed me up to Jesus was his simple message of love  forgiveness and humility. Perhaps that was enough. Yeats draws heavily on Christian imagery in this poem  and conventional interpretations focus on assigning meanings to specific words and explaining them through theological references. I am more interested in how the poetic imagination makes it possible to enter the verse from our own vantage point. A poem written after the First World War begins to acquire a new life in these times of COVID-19.  The “rough beast” that “slouches towards Bethlehem to be born” in this poem is  for me  the hidden aspect of our own self that we hesitate to confront because it makes us look bad. We find comfort in believing that evil is a monster out there -- an anti-Christ of sorts -- who must be fought and eliminated. The holy place  symbolized by Bethlehem  can be found in our own heart. For this new realization to be born  we must be willing to bury our own ignorance and prejudice.  Our education did not prepare us for a time when “things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” There is an ocean of suffering we are all swimming in  and this includes those who have not been infected by the corona virus. People are hurting from hunger  financial distress  mental health issues  and the death of loved ones.  Living through a period like this is an experience that most of us feel unequipped for. We survive “the blood-dimmed tide” only because of personal resilience  networks of mutual support  the generosity of strangers  and whatever protection our privilege affords us. For me  Jesus is not a historical character or a mythological being; he denotes all that is brave and beautiful in us. I imagine his second coming not as the miraculous appearance of a new prophet but as the resurgence of Christ-like qualities such as love  kindness and service among ordinary people. This puts the onus on us instead of divine intervention. When Yeats says  “surely some revelation is at hand ” I think we are being called to dive within and learn from those inner stirrings rather than a master who will instruct us.  Our leaders have let us down  and we must take responsibility for this because we elected them. If “the best lack all conviction  while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensity ” this is an apt occasion to reflect on what led us to make those choices. Bigotry  racism and homophobia have not suddenly materialized out of nowhere. We have played a role in nurturing them either through active participation or the refusal to speak up.  Knowing that “The darkness drops again” can be scary but we must remember that renewal does not happen overnight. New shoots cannot announce their presence until the soil is ready. Waiting  after all  is a test of endurance. When “the ceremony of innocence is drowned ” it can be useful to cultivate a “gaze blank and pitiless as the sun” that is directed inwards in anticipation of fresh understanding.  War-mongering cannot save lives during a pandemic. The skills that are most beneficial have to do with feeding  nurturing  healing -- whether it is at home  in the hospitals  or on the streets. In my view  the second coming is also about giving Mary Magdalene a place as important as Jesus. Scholars can debate whether she was a follower  apostle or companion of Jesus but let us pay heed to the lessons that nature is teaching us. The time is ripe for us to dismantle patriarchy  to honour a living spiritual practice rather than scriptural meanings set in stone  and to recognize the value of qualities that are typically considered feminine and therefore under-appreciated. The “Spiritus Mundi” that Yeats speaks of in this poem is his unique way of describing the universe as a collective soul. That  for me  is an invitation to think about and affirm our interconnectedness with each other. Chintan Girish Modi is a writer  educator and researcher.

During the COVID 19 crisis Emma will be offering mattresses to hospitals and channelising donations to help the marginalised in collaboration with the NGO.,“My family is contributing towards a New Delhi-based charity that is providing packages of essentials like atta  dal  oil  sugar and salt to daily wagers who have lost their source of income due to the corona virus pandemic and have moved one of our part time domestic helps into our home with her family so they are looked after ” said Parmeet Singh Sood  a Gurgaon-based entrepreneur.  As images of migrant workers walking down major arterial roads across the country become a stark reality for how this lockdown has impacted the lives of lives of India’s poor  urban India has been quick to join the war against COVID 19 crisis in the country and have been doing their bit to make a difference. “We are sitting cushioned in our homes  with provisions well-stocked for the next month. What about those who don’t even know if they will be able to feed their children till the end of this lockdown if they don’t go to work. It’s people like us who need to support the less fortunate ” added Supreeta Ahuja  a home maker  who has decided to pay her household helps an additional month’s salary to tide over this tough phase. Here’s what you can do to help: • Care for those who work for you Offer financial support to families of domestic helps as well as office boys  runners  security guards you are in contact with. • Donate to a charity Use this opportunity to offer financial support to a charity organisation working towards social upliftment. They are all stretched for resources. • Minimalistic living With malls  restaurants and other modes of entertainment closed  it is a good time to reflect on your expenses and make long-term lifestyle changes. • Contain wastage Make sure you conserve resources at the household level and have minimise wastage. While supplies are not yet affected  one doesn’t have an end date to the problem yet. • Care for the earth Isn’t it great to live under blue skies and see AQI levels hit an all-time low! We should take this as an opportunity to look for ways to heal the earth and control human activities which are wreaking havoc on mother earth. Time to step up NGOs  across the globe  are also working relentlessly to offer round-the-clock support to the marginalised sections of society  the segment that is bearing the brunt of the COVID 19 crisis. However  many of these social sector organizations are struggling to sustain themselves since the corporate and public charitable expenditure have reduced drastically owing to the economic crisis. Most NGOs rely on public fund-raising to manage their operations and help those in distress. Goonj is one such NGO  which is known for its phenomenal work of turning urban surplus to basic functional resource for the rural areas. They have been working hard around the lockdown to cater to the needs of the community. In order to help them sail through this period of financial strain owing to the looming COVID 19 crisis  Emma mattresses  an award-winning mattress brand from Europe  has tied up with Goonj to launch the ‘Emma’s for Everyone’ campaign  as part of which hospitals across the country  which are overstretched for resources will be provided memory foam orthopaedic mattresses free of charge.  In addition  the premium mattress manufacturers will also double any monetary contribution made directly to Goonj by individuals directed from their website for the entire duration of the campaign. The intent is to support the non-profit  which is already running on stretched resources  in its efforts to help the needy by providing them with basics like food  clothing and medicines.  Individuals making donations will also get a chance to enter a charitable raffle to win Emma products worth Rs 1 million. The winners can use this credit with a life-long validity anywhere in the world. Emma mattress  which is one of Europe’s leading mattress companies  is also using its website to create awareness about Covid-19 and stress on the importance of social distancing through its ‘Stay Home India’ social media campaign. This is being used to create awareness of the dos and don’t during this tough time in a bid to flatten the curve and control the surge in cases currently being reported.

11/04/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Donation to PM-Cares  not states’ relief fund  to count as CSR: Govt,A clarification to the effect by the ministry of corporate affairs triggered opposition allegations that the Centre intended to corner all the money that companies had earmarked for CAR activities -- a charge the government brushed aside.,New Delhi Companies’ contributions to the chief minister’s relief fund or the state relief fund towards the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will not count as corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending  but those to the newly established Prime Minister ‘s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) fund or to the State Disaster Management Authority will  the Centre said on Saturday. A clarification to the effect by the ministry of corporate affairs triggered opposition allegations that the Centre intended to corner all the money that companies had earmarked for CAR activities -- a charge the government brushed aside. “If CM Relief Fund is included  CSR money will not flow outside of the industrial states such as Maharashtra  Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.Industrial states will consume about 57% of the about Rs 15 000 annual CSR funds and non-industrial states like Bihar  Bengal  Orissa and the Northeast would remain high and dry ” a government official said  requesting anonymity.  Criticising the Union government  Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury had said: “Corner all CSR monies for his personally named fund & deny States - who are in the frontline of combatting #COVID19 -- these funds. This is “Cooperative Federalism”? Amend Schedule 7 of Companies Act to permit State govts to access these funds which could save millions of lives.”  The schedule specifies government-approved CSR activities  which include eradicating hunger  poverty and malnutrition  and promoting healthcare  education and gender equality. It also covers activities related to environmental sustainability  protection of national heritage  art and culture  training to promote sports  contributing to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and disaster management. Companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more  or a turnover of Rs 1 000 crore or more  or a net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year are mandatorily required to spend 2% of their average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR. These activities are governed by the Section 135 of the Companies Act  2013 and the government specifies activities to be undertaken by a company under CSR. In a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers  the ministry of corporate affairs said corporate donations to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund or State Relief Fund for combating Covid-19 had not been included in Schedule VII of the Companies Act  2013 and contributions to the funds shall not qualify as admissible CSR expenditure. MCA said the FAQs were issued after various stakeholders sent representations seeking a clarification on what expenditure to advance the fight against the pandemic would qualify as CSR spending. There had been confusion over the eligibility  of donations made towards combating Covid-19 to be counted as CSR expenditure after the Centre issued two separate circulars on the matter. “Keeping in view of the spread of novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) in India  its declaration as pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO)  and decision of Government of India to treat this as a notified disaster  it is hereby clarified that spending of CSR funds for COVID-19 is eligible CSR activity ” the first circular on March 23 said. On March 28  MCA issued a clarification that “any contribution made to the PM CARES Fund shall qualify as CSR expenditure” under the Companies Act 2013. The same day the government had announced the setting up of the public charitable trust under the oversight of the Prime Minister. While CSR is a board-driven process and the board of a company is empowered to plan  decide  execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendation of its CSR committee  the government specifies broad areas eligible to be counted as CSR activities. According to an industry estimate  about Rs 50 000 crore has been spent on CSR since 2014-15 and around Rs 30 000 crore still remains unspent. On average  companies’ annual CSR funds are to the tune of Rs 15 000 crore. CSR funds of several companies remain unspent for  lack of eligible projects. Minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Singh Thakur told Lok Sabha on March 16 that a high-level committee on CSR had recommended that unspent CSR money be transferred to a separate designated account created for the purpose.  “Such unspent amount  and the interest earned thereon  be spent within a period of three to five years  failing which the same be transferred to a fund to be specified by the central government which may be used for innovative  high-impact projects related to activities listed in schedule VII ” Thakur said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donation-to-pm-cares-not-states-relief-fund-to-count-as-csr-govt/story-6EnOFfBEQPZYkqMkbs4V5J.html

11/04/2020,technology;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,No betting  kids,One of the newest and worrisome things that kids these days are doing is betting on online games during the lockdown,As children are confined to their homes due to the corona virus pandemic they are discovering ways to spend time with friends so that they fill the long hours of the day. Classic board games with classics like Ludo  Uno and Monopoly  among others are back from the brink to beat lock down boredom but with a twist. Online versions of the game had already made it popular among millennials. But one of the things that it has led to is illegal betting which has become a cause of concern for many parents.  Rohit Gupta  a 37-year-old software expert reveals that the found out that his eight-year-old son Parth was playing ludo and placing bets via paytm  “My son casually asked me to transfer his pocket money to Paytm like every month. I decided to give him only Rs one thousand as he didn’t have school or any activities to attend. In just two days  I saw that Rs 300 had already gone and I realised that he was playing online games with actual money. I couldn’t believe these kids have taken up on betting. I have taken the remaining money back.” Punit Shah a businessman from suburban Mumbai discovered that his 13 year old son Aarav was playing Monoploy with real money  “He came to me and asked for Rs 500 which he said he owed to his friend who stays in the same building. At first he told me that he had borrowed money but later he revealed the real reason and said he lost while playing the game. I asked him to immediately uninstall all the games from his phone.” On the other hand  Aarav feels that it’s just for fun and are also collecting money for donations  “We just place friendly bets. We keep aside some money from each game that we play. My friends and I have collectively decided that at the end of 21-days we will donate the entire amount.  Aarav’s friend Palash Mehta argues that they are anyway saving money by not going out  “How does it matter if we spend a few bucks? We aren’t going to any coffee shops or restaurants. We are doing it just for fun.” Child psychologist Vijay Kamath feels that this behaviour could also led to bullying  “If any child loses  and isn’t a position to pay money  it can have an adverse effect. Also  I believe most children pick up these habits from their parents and we have seen how Diwali card parties have become a common trend in today’s time. Monitoring what the child plays or watches is also very important.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/no-betting-kids/story-A5qTtT7GivSIYiLdG06lkI.html
11/04/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;jersey,Lockdown Diaries: The importance of human company by Biswadeep Ghosh,Enforced isolation has made the writer resolve to be more outgoing once the lockdown has been lifted,Patna is eerily quiet. In the lane where I live  stray dogs are the only ones who are loud  active and out on the streets all day. The locality has scores of noisy pigeons  who have made homes in windows everywhere. Even they have stopped cooing  it occasionally seems.  Mine is a spacious two-bedroom flat on the fourth floor in a well-maintained apartment complex  which stands out among other buildings with shabby exteriors in the middle-class neighbourhood.  Meant to be residential buildings when built  some of them have been converted into hostels for students from neighbouring towns and villages  who come to Patna to enrol in coaching centres for competitive examinations every year. Today  I cannot see a single soul on the balconies and rooftops of these hostels. Like the neighbourhood shopkeepers who are from rural Bihar  the students too have left for home. I miss their unpleasant yelling  which I often heard when they walked past my apartment complex in small groups.  What was disturbance yesterday is an absence today. Having returned to my home town after spending more than 25 years in New Delhi  Mumbai and Pune  I live with my septuagenarian mother  who conducts music classes in the evenings and watches regressive Bangla television serials at night. At the moment  she is in New Delhi with my younger brother and his wife. During such testing times  mom’s presence in Patna would have been comforting  her liking for gibberish on the television notwithstanding.  She cannot fly back to Patna now. We talk on the phone every day. She sounds exhausted and mumbles in a weak voice. After there is nothing left to talk about  one of us murmurs an informal goodbye and I confront deathly silence once again.  Personal tragedies can change lives. A few recent ones have turned me into an introvert  who has spent most of his time inside a tiny room in the last three years. I have not been keen on company after work  have not met school and college buddies who also live in Patna  and have not even attended puja celebrations in my apartment complex. Distancing myself has kept me contented; I have not bothered to ask myself why.  Now  I want to meet somebody  just about anybody I know. I am desperate to sit with them and talk about the mundane joys and sorrows of simply-led lives. I want to share stories about childhood pranks  failed relationships  life during the 16-hour work days of the past  of how my marriage cracked up  leaving me staring at the future.  Days spent in solitude behind closed doors have reminded me of the importance of human company. I am desperate to spend time with real people unafraid of falling sick through contact. That is what I need.  Fifty-one isn’t young. I realise my reflexes have slowed down. I find it faintly amusing that I am the youngest resident on the fourth floor. One of the four like-sized apartments on this floor is owned by a retired banker  a widow  who lives alone. We interact circumspectly with both of us standing a couple of metres away from each other.  “I prefer to sit quietly these days ” she says. Her only son is a thirty-something software professional living in New York  which has been devastated by the ongoing pandemic.  An elderly couple in their sixties lives in the apartment next to mine. Knowing I am alone  they sometimes make food for me  one of them passing the dishes to me with outstretched hands.  Usually  they are garrulous extroverts who step out to meet their relatives and friends and like chatting endlessly. The sound of their television every evening on an average day is an indication that both of them watch Bangla serials as passionately as my mother does.  Their TV has gone silent in the last few days. The husband  a retired university professor  has told me that much of his time is spent following the news on the cell phone. They  too  have a son. He lives and works in New Jersey. The third flat is owned by a couple  who might have been forgotten had the husband not been on the cell phone for hours every day. They have cut themselves off entirely  limiting their interaction to a quick “hello” when we meet inside or near the lift.  I met the wife  whose timing of placing the garbage bin outside her flat had coincided with mine  a few days ago. “How are you?” she gently asked  adding  “We are scared  you know. If an old person contracts the corona virus disease  he or she might develop serious complications. That we have pre-existing health conditions makes it worse.” Having spoken with her face hidden behind a multi-coloured mask  she quickly disappeared inside her flat.  That is the only time I have exchanged a few sentences with her since the lockdown came into effect.  Trapped in uneasy silence  I want to return to that cacophonic world I knew until recently in which people didn’t wear masks; when they bargained with shopkeepers  taught at schools  ate in restaurants  and went to malls and the movies without apprehensions. I want to meet friends and colleagues  see my mother  and fly down to New Delhi to meet my brother and his wife. I want to talk to them about things that make no sense and experience the joy of doing so.  After the pandemic fades away  I promise to step out of my room and remain there for most of the day.  While the door to the world outside remains firmly shut  I have a dream. Biswadeep Ghosh is a journalist  author  and teacher. Among his books is MSD: The Man  The Leader  the biography of former Indian cricket captain MS Dhoni.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/lockdown-diaries-the-importance-of-human-company-by-biswadeep-ghosh/story-iYeE9qm2GleOgFYElQ8rgK.html
10/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,canada;germany;spain;united kingdom;slovenia;thailand,Coronakrach: Two important books on what pandemics do to your mind,As Covid 19 turns the global order upside down  two scholarly books help you understand how corruption  decay  pollution  and anomie are interlinked to viruses threatening mankind,“…when a potentially dangerous outbreak appears on the horizon  we give in to those impulses again  this time at the collective  societal level. Massive anxiety or massive hysteria heralds and shrouds an actual outbreak and once the outbreak turns out to be contained and subsiding  we turn our heads away and forget about the horrors of anticipating the wave of the pandemic  having conquered our fears  wrote Sameer Khan and Damir Huremović  US-based psychiatrists  in a paper titled Psychology of the Pandemic in Psychiatry of Pandemics - A Mental Health Response to Infection Outbreak (Ed. Damir Huremović; Springer  May 2019). Did Huremović have a premonition that a mega catastrophe  propelled by the Corona virus  was six months away and that it would infect over one million people and kill over 70 000 across the world in the first two stages?  Not at all. Thinking very differently  he wrote in the first few lines of the preface: “This book could have been written a century ago – at a time when the last true pandemic was sweeping the globe and psychiatry was emerging from the confines of insanity asylums and establishing itself as a reputable medical specialty. At the time  it did not happen  and for the next hundred years or so  psychiatry would not seriously consider and address the mental health challenges accompanying massive infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics.”  Yet  he seems to have envisioned something unwittingly. In the preface he states: “Few human experiences are so profound and so terrifying  as is the fear of being stricken by a grave contagion  a process that can not only kill us  but worse – it can mutilate our body and transmogrify our soul into something no longer recognizable  no longer human. This notion is only made worse by the realization that such affliction is passed onto us by our fellow humans  even our loved ones  or that we have passed it onto them. Such realization poisons and unravels the social fabric of humanity.” In recent memory  the world has not witnessed such catastrophe-triggered stress on preexisting psychic frictions. Disaster psychiatry seeks to “outline mental health responses that are  by default  undertaken as e mergency mental health responses to a disaster” (Introduction  p5). This clinical discipline is “applicable to organizing and providing emergency mental health response to epidemic outbreaks  there is little focus within disaster psychiatry on infectious diseases alone” The initial responses to lockdown  isolation and quarantine makes books like the one we are discussing relevant.  In an essay in Le Monde diplomatique on 11 March 2020  the day the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic  Frédéric Lordon coined the word “coronakrach” for the massive anxiety or hysteria that shrouds the condition. Huremović  foreseeing nothing like this  wrote  “an actual outbreak and once the outbreak turns out to be contained and subsiding  we turn our heads away and forget about the horrors of anticipating the wave of the pandemic  having conquered our fears” The 13-chapter book is a good read on how “Pandemics disrupt our sense of reality and order  leading to a changed way of storing and metabolizing memories and experiences”. It also looks at the deepening existential meaning of the outbreak whose manifestation is now a reality. Contributors to the book include Christy Duan  Howard Linder  Guitelle St Victor  Saeed Ahmed  Jacqueline Levin  and Saira Hussain. These scholars have taken up subjects like a brief history of pandemics  the societal  public and epidemiological aspects  the importance of culture in managing mental health response  the neuropsychiatric complications of infectious out breaks  social distancing  quarantine and isolation  and effects on healthcare workers. In another paper on the neuropsychiatric complications of infectious outbreaks  Huremović points out social media’s lack of responsibility. Instagram posts misled readers on the Zika outbreak: “60% of the posts included misleading  incomplete  or unclear information about the virus… over 50% of the images used expressed fear and negative sentiment.” “There is a single word that can serve as a fitting point of departure for our brief journey through the history of pandemics – that word is the plague ” he rightly says. Human history made pandemic or epidemic a synonym of the plague.  This collection reminded me of an exceptional work: Contagion: How Commerce Has Spread Disease (Yale University Press  2012) by Mark Harrison  professor of medical history at Oxford University. He mapped seven centuries and six continents to show how business and governments handled (read mishandled) every significant outbreak of cross-border disease from the Black Death of the 1300s to more recent scares including SARS  mad cow disease and the Mexican swine flu scare of 2009. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  the first pandemic of the 21st century  Harrison wrote  was no “domestic issue but a global concern. On 15 March the WHO confirmed that SARS was no ‘worldwide health threat’. With cases  spotted in Canada  Thailand and Vietnam  ‘by 19 March suspect cases had appeared in the USA  Spain  Germany  Slovenia and the United Kingdom. The speed with which the disease travelled was an unsettling reminder of how small the world had become. Inevitably  SARS soon came to be associated with the phenomenon of globalization”. SARS got woven into “networks of commerce and tourism – and in more subtle ways  as the lightning-fast transmission of information enabled by electronic media created a virtual pandemic.” Harrison presented a historical overview of the interplay between disease and commerce  politics and international diplomacy  looked at how contagion  trade and statecraft are intertwined  and unraveled ‘unstable compromises’. All these are encapsulated in the chapter  War by Other Means. Plague  for instance  following the world’s main arteries of trade was spread by merchant traders in Europe during the 17th century. Huge yellow-fever outbreaks in the Americas in the 19th century were triggered by the slave trade. Outbreaks of respiratory diseases  including avian influenza  escalated rapidly into pandemics as a result of air travel as in Covid 19 – all are a deadly legacy of commerce imposed on humanity. The 43 pages of plates on the history of contagion that touch on how slave markets were among the principal hubs of infectious disease in the Americas  on how yellow fever crossed the Atlantic from Africa in the 1640s  and on black death can be precious materials for power point presentations on the anastomosis between pandemics and epidemics on the one side and colonialism and imperialism on the other. As Covid 19 threatens to turn the global order upside down  these two books help dispassionate readers understand corruption  decay  pollution  anomie  and weakness anew and see how these are interlinked to viruses threatening increasingly helpless mankind.

Therefore  it has been decided that facial masks will be compulsory for anyone stepping out of their house. Cloth mask shall be eligible too ” Kejriwal announced on Twitter. Wearing of facial masks can reduce the spread of corona virus substantially. Therefore  it has been decided that facial masks will be compulsory for anyone stepping out of their house. Cloth mask shall be eligible too. Delhi became the third state in the country on Wednesday to pass such an edict after Maharashtra which ordered the use of masks in Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh made it compulsory for people across the state. Follow coronavirus latest updates here. While Kejriwal did not specify any penal action for not wearing masks  Uttar Pradesh said there could be legal action against those ignoring the order. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a circular warned of arrest under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for failure to wear masks while moving in public places. Less than an hour after Kejriwal’s announcement  his deputy Manish sisodia said action will be taken against people not following the order.

The most we can expect are staggered and perhaps region-based withdrawals of the restrictions.,The government has made no official announcement about the end of the lockdown but I don’t know a single person who believes that it will end on schedule. The most we can expect are staggered and perhaps region-based withdrawals of the restrictions. Sensing that there might be a backlash  the Centre has chosen to involve the states in the process of consultation. And leaks to the media have made it appear that the extended lockdown will be the Centre’s response to requests from the states. I don’t think any sensible person can advocate a total withdrawal of all restrictions on 15th April. It is too soon to gauge how much progress we are making in the battle against Covid. And one mistake is all it takes to lose momentum in this effort. And once the toothpaste is out of the tube it won’t go back inside. On the other hand  there are the demands of the economy. Daily wagers are going hungry. Entire sectors are struggling to survive: retail  hospitality  manufacturing etc. And not enough people are talking about the agricultural sector. How can farmers harvest their crops at a time of lockdown? How do they transport them to the mandis? Just as we wonder about the lockdown  we worry about nearly everything that has to do with the Corona Virus. One reason why we are all so tense is because we know so little. And so  it seems do the scientists. This is a new virus. Nobody has much experience of it. And scientists don’t fully understand its behaviour. So nearly everything that you are told is the truth one day tends to be contradicted a week later. Worse still  politicians have now got involved. We had India’s junior Health Minister telling us that 15 minutes of sunlight would kill viruses. In Britain  Boris Johnson listened to bad advice  believed in a herd immunity approach and wasted valuable time. Worst of all has been the behaviour of Donald Trump  the world’s most powerful man  who spent weeks acting as though Covid was no big deal  going so far as to call it a Democratic hoax. Another of Trump’s positions shows us how little we really know about the virus. Some weeks ago Trump announced that a drug called Hydroxy Chloroquine (HCR) was a miracle cure for the illness. HCR is not a new drug. It has been used for decades to treat malaria. But nobody of any consequence in the US had touted it as a cure for Covid till Trump made his claim. Anthony Fauci  the US’s top infectious diseases expert  tried to distance himself from Trump’s claim but by then it was too late because the President boasted that the US had stockpiled 29 million doses of the drug. When he was questioned closely about his discovery of a miracle cure  Trump said  “In France  they had a very good test.” Trump was referring to a single  flawed French study of 36 patients that had already been rubbished by the scientific community as being poorly conducted. Soon after Trump issued his endorsement  many doctors (including those who appeared on Indian TV) seemed to agree with him. A shortage of HCR in the US (and unusually high demand in India and other countries  for instance) made it difficult for patients who were already taking it (for other ailments) to obtain supplies. Now  the cycle has turned. US doctors are openly countering the President’s claims and even in India  doctors have been appearing on TV and other media to advise people not to take HCR without medical supervision and warning of dangerous consequences to healthy patients who take it. Trump continues to tout HCR - his recent threat of ‘retaliation’ to India was about supplies of HCR. But it will take time to find out if HCR can ‘cure’ Covid  though  the odds of it turning out to be a ‘miracle cure’ or a ‘prophylactic’ are low to zero. Take another instance. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the US surgeon general declared that masks would not help avoid Corona infection. Then  around a fortnight ago  the conventional wisdom on masks began to change. Even the government of India which followed WHO’s lead  has now changed its tune on masks to the extent that now there is even talk of making masks compulsory for anyone who leaves his or her house. Where does all this leave the average person? Should we have stocked up on HCR? Should we have bought masks before many shops ran out of them? We don’t know. Because scientists didn’t either. As with all such pandemics where scientists have too little experience  the non-scientists have sometimes seemed as wise. Nassim Nicholas Taleb  the statistician and probability expert (best known for his bestseller The Black Swan) launched a statistical exercise comparing Covid rates in countries where there was a tradition of using masks to those that did not use them. He found that the mask countries were way better off. Though Taleb’s work was derided by scientists  it contributed to a change in thinking and to the eventual turnaround on the mask issue. The original US and UK government recommendation had been for health workers to use masks. The general population was told they were unnecessary. This made no sense to many people. How could the same mask which was unnecessary for us suddenly become vital when a health worker put it on? (Presumably the authorities meant that health workers were more exposed to the virus and had greater need but this was not always clear.) The mask controversy relates to another issue: how does the infection spread?  So far  scientists have said that it spreads through contact. You touch something that has the virus (a surface  for instance) and sometime later you touch a part of your face (mouth  nose  eyes  etc.) from where the virus can enter your system. Hence the need to keep washing your hands. The second way is through droplet infection. Somebody  sneezes and releases droplets of saliva  packed with the virus  into the air. You inhale the virus and it enters your system. But  scientists say  the droplets are large and will soon drop to the ground so  if you maintain a distance from an infected person  you are okay. Hence the policy of social distancing. Now  some scientists say that yes  droplets do fall to earth but there are other micro-droplets that are smaller and lighter can float in the air for hours.These may be released even through the breath of an infected person. The problem will all of this that a) nobody knows how much of the virus needs to enter your system to infect you so is a single micro droplet dangerous? b) just because you can detect a virus in a lab test hours after it left the body does not mean that it is still infectious c) Scientists have paid too little attention to the ‘viral load’. As the author and doctor Siddharth Mukherjee recently pointed out  just because two separate individuals are both infected by Corona  it does not follow that they both have similar loads of the virus. Studies suggest that people with higher loads of viruses have a bigger chance of dying than those with lighter loads. Is that true of Covid? Probably: there just isn’t enough work on the subject. Then  there is the fluctuation in rates of infection. In some countries  Corona seems much deadlier than in others. In India  for instance  the virus has been less deadly than we feared. In the UK and America  on the other hand  there have been thousands of infections and many more deaths than in India.  Various theories have been advanced for the disparity: Indians have a natural immunity  we are a hot country  we are afflicted with less virulent strain of Corona  etc. Last week  an intriguing new theory (statistical  like Taleb’s work on masks) made the headlines. In countries where there is a tradition of vaccinating people with BCG against TB  there appears to be a much lower mortality rate. Could it be that BCG gives us a higher level of antibody resistance? The numbers support this view. Most Asian countries vaccinate their children with BCG but only a few Western countries do this as a matter of course. In Spain  where there is no BCG  mortality rates are high. In Portugal  where children are vaccinated  mortality rates are lower. The outlier is China  which has a BCG tradition and still has lost thousands to the pandemic. One answer is that the deaths come from Wuhan  which is the epicentre of the epidemic. In the rest of China  mortality rates have been substantially lower than Wuhan and perhaps  such European countries as Italy. So  should we all take BCG again? Don’t most of us already have antibodies for TB anyway? Can we compare responses to Corona (a virus) to TB (spread by bacteria)? As of now  nobody knows for sure. Because ultimately  scientists are still groping for answers. They know very little about Covid and what little they know seem to change almost on a weekly basis. Which is why the best thing for us to do may be to not wait for science to come up with the answers. Everything we know suggests that social distancing works. (No scientist disputes this.) Because the virus is spread though touch  washing your hands works. Staying at home and avoiding crowds works. And it’s probably a good idea to wear a mask if you are going out. It may or may not protect you but if you do have the virus (and many carriers are asymptomatic) it may stop you from infecting others. What all of this leads to is a single inevitable conclusion: some kind of lockdown (perhaps not as drastic as by this one) must continue. Because in the foreseeable future there will be no miracle cure  no silver bullet and no magic vaccine. Till we can see the light at the end of the tunnel it is up to us to look after ourselves.

08/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Lockdown Diaries: Longing for company by Aseem Chhabra,How will we face the world again  sit fearlessly in large movie theatres and restaurants  and walk amid crowds?,On February 20  I had a back surgery in Delhi. Five days later  I was released from the hospital  but given my condition I was not to step out. Since the time I left the hospital I have only gone out four times  to see the doctor and once my cousin drove me to an ATM. When the Covid-19 related lockdown was enforced I had already been home in self-isolation mode for a month. I have been a freelancer since 2009  when I lived in New York City. I would work from home  but I always had the option to go out whenever I wished to. There was a Starbucks downstairs in my building and I would often sit there for a few hours  especially in the summers because of the air-conditioning. It helped to talk to strangers  or just hear the chatter of others sitting around me.  I have not had a concept of a weekend or vacation for more than a decade. I could take time off and not work. Otherwise I could work all day  sometimes late at night  as long as I would meet my deadlines. Living mostly in Noida since 2016  I was used to working at odd hours  then taking a cab to Delhi to have drinks in Khan Market  go eat chaat  sit in a quiet café  or walk in the midst of the crowds in Connaught Place. My work lifestyle gave me the option to be alone when I wanted to or find myself lost in a mall at 4 pm. The new real – the lockdown situation  perhaps important to control the spread of the virus  has been difficult. I find it stifling and suffocating to be home bound. I know it is also tough for people who would go to office in the morning and come back in the evening. They would rest over the weekends. I  on the other hand  had a lot more flexibility in my life. That flexibility is gone with the lockdown and it is wearing me down. At the same time I know I am privileged. I have a roof over my head  food on the table and I am safe at home. There are thousands less fortunate – the daily wage earners who trudged all the way back home to their villages. For them it was a question of survival. I take my survival for granted when I complain about being locked up. My day starts with breakfast  followed by physiotherapy  which I do on my own  since the physiotherapist has not been coming over for the past couple of weeks. Shower  lunch  perhaps a brief nap  then more physiotherapy  followed by dinner. And finally I watch a film. Films keep me sane.  It has become a predictable routine. I feel like the Bill Murray character  stuck in a Groundhog Day state of mind. I try and read a little. This year I have promised myself to read Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy for the second time. But it was easier for me to read the 1400-page long magnum opus riding in the crowded subways in New York City. It is a little hard for some reason now that I am stuck at home I don’t mind spending time with myself. I am essentially a loner. In fact  most writers tend to be. Your work involves the connection you make with your laptop. When you write words  sentences  paragraphs  pages  and eventually finish an article or even a book – it is your loneliness that sees you through the process. But sometimes even loners long for company and no matter how much I engage in social media  it is not the same as sitting face-to-face with a friend  with a glass of wine in my hand. I live at home with my 91-year-old mother who is unwell and hard of hearing. It took me a few days to explain to her the havoc that Covid-19 has created. We have a live-in maid who cooks for us and takes care of my mother. I talk the most with her  but there is a limitation to how much we can converse. To amuse my followers and myself on Instagram  I started a hashtag #WhereIWantToEatAfterTheVirusIsGone. I have posted old photographs -- street foods of Varanasi and Patna  cafes and restaurants I love  especially Illiterati Books & Coffee in Dharamsala and Lahore Tikka House in Toronto  for the best kababs and biryani. Like the films I watch  these images keep me sane and hopeful of better times. Read more: ‘I told Priyanka Chopra  she could not come across as a Yankee-sounding person’ But what I fear the most is this -- will I be able to trust people  when the lockdown is lifted  the virus is gone and if some of us have survived? Will I be able to feel comfortable enough to touch a stranger  shake hands  hug someone -- a friend or relative  somebody even closer? Right now  I feel frustrated to be home. But the virus  the lockdown and self-isolation have also convinced me that I am safest when I am alone.  How will I face the world once again  sit in large movie theatres and restaurants? Will I be able to go back to New York City  walk in Time Square and be jostled around by tourists? I am unsure about that. Corona virus has really changed how I perceive my existence and I don’t know if I can flip the switch on again and start to think differently. It will take a long time for me to accept the next new normal.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/lockdown-diaries-longing-for-company-by-aseem-chhabra/story-qZ2TwJjQ3cTUn8THhXBiCN.html

The actor is spending time cooking for and telling stories to daughter Aashi  something that he’s longing to do. Apart from “cooking her favourite dishes such as nutrela chawal  aloo chokha and chana dal”  Tripathi is also helping her with her lessons. But most importantly  the father-daughter duo is “bonding over storytelling”.“Mujhe kahani sunaana achha lagta hai  aur logon ko sunna bhi. We all have grown up listening to stories from our grandparents and parents. Interestingly  all these stories would teach us something ” says Tripathi  adding that he’s also penning down tales for films. A post shared by Pankaj Tripathi (@pankajtripathi) on Mar 22  2020 at 4:15am PDT The stories that he’s writing are for age agnostic. “Now that we don’t have much time  aur dadi  nani bhi bahut logon ke nahi hai toh woh kahani cinema ya web mein dekh ke khush hote hai. And in these difficult times  stories would give hope  they are good mood elevators. Storytelling is an art. I don’t know how good or bad I’m in it  but I enjoy weaving tales with a message ” he adds. Tripathi is also planning to share his personal journey through 5-10-minute-long small videos  which may release on social media soon. He shares  “No one thought that a farmer’s son from a village will make it to films. I feel grateful that I could somehow fulfil my dream. People have often shown interest in my life’s story  maybe because they find it interesting  inspiring. Hence  this thought of sharing parts in videos ” says the 43-year-old. While he’s doing his bit to help others during this Covid-19 crisis  he prefers to do it silently. “Corona ne hum logon mein karuna (compassion) jagayi hai  jo bahut achhi baat hai… Along with medical and paramedical workers  police  municipal workers  I think we should also show respect towards our farmers. It’s because of them that we’re getting food to eat.

07/04/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Duo in Narela quarantine facility booked for defecating in open,,The Delhi Police have registered a first information report (FIR) against two persons for allegedly defecating in a corridor of a quarantine centre in outer Delhi’s Narela  where those who had attended Tablighi Jamaat congregations have been placed. They were evacuated from a Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin on March 31.  The police said the two men had defecated on the second-floor corridor  outside the flat where they are staying.  A case was registered on April 4 on the complaint of the in-charge of three housing blocks of Delhi Development Authority (DDA) that have been re-purposed as quarantine centres. The DDA flats  yet to be occupied since construction  were the first to be re-purposed as quarantine centres. “...the persons residing in 212 second floor...are the suspect of the above said act and not following the instruction of health department/government and helping the spread of Novel Corona Virus and put the life of people at risk and jeopardize the entire containment measure ” the FIR read. The official said that on April 4  sanitation workers reported the incident in B-block to the housekeeping supervisor. “The housekeeping staff complained that people in quarantine often created a commotion  misbehaved with them and were not following the social distancing norms. After the open defecation incident  we filed a complaint with the police ” a government official said.  Joint commissioner of police (northern range)  Manish Kumar Aggarwal  said  “We registered a case under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code after the matter was brought to our notice.” According to a senior Delhi government official  this is not the first time such an incident has been reported. “We asked the police to register a FIR  as these people had defecated in the corridors earlier as well. We had warned them  but some of them continue to misbehave and not follow quarantine rules ” said the official. Nearly 1 000 people of more than 2 350 people  including foreigners  who were evacuated from the Markaz  where they had assembled for religious congregations last month  are at the Delhi government-run quarantine facilities and hospitals in the city.  Earlier  The Uttar Pradesh government invoked the stringent National Security Act against six quarantined persons  after staffers of a hospital in Ghaziabad had alleged harassment by those placed in quarantine after attending the congregations. Health officials had accused them of making lewd remarks and roaming naked on the hospital premises. They were later shifted to an isolation ward in a private educational institution. Four days ago  two inmates at a quarantine facility  set up in an institute  in Narela had managed to escape  prompting the police to register a case and launch a search operation. They were found at their houses in east Delhi’s Patparganj village and brought back to the quarantine centre. “We had immediately informed the police and the two men were brought back to the facility ” said an official  on the condition of anonymity.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/duo-in-narela-quarantine-facility-booked-for-defecating-in-open/story-slWuX3HekkH4kNJBS8JFmJ.html
07/04/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,Quarantine skincare: Exfoliating  toning  moisturising  5 key steps to follow,From cleansing to exfoliating and toning  here’s the skincare regime you must follow in the wake of Covid-19.,They say it takes 21 days to form a habit and usually we are so caught up in our daily chores that we aren’t able to take out time to craft a skincare routine. However  now due to the lockdown  we have enough time to pamper our skin. Here’s what experts Blossom Kochhar and Taruna Yadav recommend. Cleansing with natural water-based purifying cleansers: You can use a cleanser with Kashmiri saffron and neem this would gently cleanses and purifies the skin without stripping the natural moisture of the skin. Herbs like Neem and Nagkesar work well as effective antimicrobials and purifying agents. Exfoliate your skin: For exfoliation  you can either use an exfoliator or make your own using the ingredients in your kitchen. This is the best time to utilise all the kitchen ingredients into your skincare which is not only good for the skin but are also full of vitamins and minerals. To make an exfoliator  you can use rice powder along with lemon juice mixed with water or curd and apply it onto the skin. You can mix oats  curd and honey as well. Coffee can also act as a great exfoliator. The skin should only be exfoliated twice a week.  Make a pack: The exfoliation can be followed up with a pack  either a ready made  sheet mask or can make one on your own. Anything from a banana to honey and cream can be used. It is a great combination and does wonders to your skin. Another mixture that can be used is Papaya or Avocado  just mash it  squeeze a lemon or orange into it  add milk powder and apply it on the skin for 20 minutes and rinse. You can make a pack by mixing fuller earth and rosewater as well.  Toning with Alcohol Free Toner: Spray on your face a toner which is alcohol free from a distance. It can be used during any time of the day to refresh  rehydrate and minimise enlarged pores. Its application prepares the skin for the next step of sealing and moisturising. Seal the moisture in the skin: Give yourself a nice massage which will help in rejuvenating the skin from within and give it a nice glow. For moisturisers  you can use any Vitamin E cream or an almond cream as they are nourishing. A hydrating gel with Aloe Vera will also help seal moisture in your skin.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/quarantine-skincare-101/story-MxqXOBxHd8f87jdNb2f9rO.html

07/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Adil Hussain on Covid-19 crisis: This virus attack on humanity is an opportunity for us to reflect upon our actions,Actor Adil Hussain says that this lockdown period might make us feel sad and isolated  but he asserts that it’s important to keep your spirits up.,Actor Adil Hussain believes that in these times of pandemic situation and lockdown  we  as citizens need to focus on ‘frugal’ living. He even posted a video on Instagram talking about the same on social media. We reach out to the 56-year-old to know more. He starts off by saying  “Humanity is not used to living in confinement for a long time  apart from the prison population. Human beings are social animals. It’s not a lockdown  because we still have internet connectivity  but the fact is you can’t go out of the house. Human contact is limited  we’re not being able to meet our friends. We might feel sad  isolated  these are difficult times  but it’s important to keep your spirits up.” Focusing more on why we need to be conservative in using up resources like food and water  Hussain adds that the consumption of things has grown to such a point ever since India opened up to the world market. A post shared by Adil Hussain (@_adilhussain) on Mar 23  2020 at 7:12pm PDT “We’ve almost devoured the planet with animal and industrial farming of rice  wheat  corn  pesticides. I think this virus attack on humanity is an opportunity for all of us to reflect upon our actions. It’s important to know what we actually need  and how we can find a way to be at peace ” he says  and elaborates  “For example  if we have only dal  rice and potato at home  you might have to live on that  if there’s not a supply of fresh vegetables for a long time. For the sake of your personal peace  it’s better to find a way to lead a frugal life  in terms of everything.” Since Hussain has been working non-stop from some time  how does each day pan out now? “I wake up  make breakfast  that’s my responsibility  I love it.

He has written to different authorities in the state  volunteering to be the first to undergo human trial for any vaccine to fight corona. Harkeerat Singh  who worked for the National Health Mission in 2017-18 and is presently staying in his village in Prayagraj said  “I believe life has given me an opportunity to do something for mankind. This is why I have offered myself to any authority/team working to make a vaccine for Sars-Cov-2.” Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic “No new vaccine can be administered without human trial and I am ready to be that first human ” he said. “I do not know exactly who are involved in making a vaccine  but I offer myself for human trial  whether in India or anywhere else  ” said Singh who lives with his father and brother. He has written to the health department  the local MLA and also to Sikh Sangathan in Lucknow in this connection. Asked what inspired him to make the offer  Singh said  “The Sikh community has been known for serving mankind and I am just doing the same.” About the dangers involved in such a trial  he said  “I am well aware of what can happen during a trial. But the cause is much greater than the dangers. I have made up my mind and then expressed such a desire.” He said he was ready to go to any place or country. Asked about the reaction of his family  he said  “I have not yet discussed with them but believe they will not stop me from doing my bit for mankind.” However  medical experts said there were medical and ethical issues to be addressed first. “Such an offer should be appreciated but one has to fulfill medical criteria to prove fitness for a trial. Secondly  there are ethical issues that are looked into by a medical/pharmacology committee of the state and then centre ” said Prof Samir Misra  member of the governing council of the state medical faculty. He said a vaccine was ready for human trial only after animal trial. Hence human trial could not be done directly but if the committee found him fit his offer may be kept in pending for such a trial if it happened in India. “Such a human trial will take a long time as there are many stages for a vaccine to come to human trial ” said Prof Misra  also senior faculty at department of trauma surgery at the King George’s Medical University.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kheri-man-offers-to-roll-up-his-sleeve-for-human-trial-of-any-corona-vaccine/story-YBVW2iWYI5GViqqqH64LGK.html

05/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,School closures may raise obesity among kids: Experts,,New Delhi: School closures due to the Covid-19 outbreak could exacerbate childhood obesity  according to epidemiologists from the New York Academy of Medicine and others published in Obesity journal.  Increase in obesity among schoolchildren during the summer recess has already been documented by US public health experts. Surplus weight usually accrues every summer and obesity experienced at as young as five years of age has been shown to be associated with a higher BMI (body mass index) at an older age  even up to 50 years. More than 30 million children receive subsidised school lunches and food insecurity rates are higher for such families during summer months when there is a break in schooling. Only three days of school closures could result in 405 000 missed meals among schoolchildren in the US  according to the authors of the study cited above. Along with the impact of calorie-dense foods that can be stocked up during lockdowns  children in urban areas don’t have much physical activity due to a social distancing intervention. The authors cite data to show that online video game usage is already soaring. In India  115.9 million children are enrolled in the midday meal scheme. But due to the lockdown and disruptions associated with the Covid-19 outbreak  many states are not able to give children these meals. The human resource development ministry on March 20 asked state governments to provide either hot cooked midday meals or a food security allowance for the children’s families to buy food. “As the country is passing through the difficult times of the Novel Covid-19 (Corona) outbreak The State Governments and Union Territories are advised to provide hot cooked Mid Day Meal or Food Security Allowance  whichever is feasible  to all eligible children till such time their schools are closed due to Novel COVID-l9 (Corona) Virus. The modalities for this purpose may be decided by the respective States…the regular Mid Day Meal shall resume as soon as the schools reopen ” the letter to the states reads.  Kerala was among the first to start delivering meals to schoolchildren at home. The state serves 2 584 156 children in 12 327 schools. The menu includes a banana  an egg and milk along with vegetables  pulses and rice. “It’s very difficult to say what health impact the children here are going to face because the school closure may not be long-term. More worrying is the long-term impact on the socioeconomic condition of the parents. The government should deliver midday meals to children wherever they are ” said Dr Anand Krishnan  professor  Centre for Community Medicine at All India Institute Of Medical Sciences.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-closures-may-raise-obesity-among-kids-experts/story-0WojeXk0uo9NONSNIyLlWI.html

05/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Coronavirus outbreak: How freelance professionals have been affected,Industry professionals who get paid project wise and have no other source of income may have to dig into their savings  if the lockdown continues indefinitely,Covid-19 pandemic has majorly impacted our freelance professionals - from Bollywood stylists to fashion photographers to celebrity makeup artists. Industry professionals who get paid project wise and have no other source of income may have to dig into their savings  if the lockdown continues indefinitely. Makeup artist Clint Fernandes  who works in fashion and advertising on a freelance basis feels lucky that he had clinched high-paying assignments in the months of January and February. “However  if the lockdown persists then from June onwards  I’ll have to dig into my savings and as I see makeup space  I don’t think there will be jobs even in June and July. The marketing and advertising budgets will be slashed. The only people who will be making the bucks are the ones who are working with a movie star  who’ll need them during promotions and events. I’m contemplating exploring films as another option ” says Clint. In Bollywood  celebrities started cancelling their promotional tours in the beginning of March as events stopped internationally. Stylist Eshaa Amiin recalls  “My team and I had worked hard to style an actress who was supposed to travel to the US  but the trip got cancelled. We had made so much effort in researching and there were sourcing expenses too  hence we incurred losses. I hope the unstable scenario settles soon as we have to pay for our staff and take care of them. I am positive that once Bollywood shoots start  work will start pouring in. However  the appearance styling may kind of get reduced a bit.” As a freelancer who works on assignment basis  it’s really a setback as all the bookings/weddings/shoots have been postponed or cancelled. Nisha Karna  fashion and celebrity makeup artist says  “There are times we take advances  but it would be unethical to hold on to the advances of clients  who had to cancel the events due to the current circumstances. Work will always come back but the days which we lost won’t. Once things get back to normal  either projects may overlap or not work out at all hence I’m prepared for the best and worse. As of now I’m being optimistic and still taking bookings for end of the year. The wedding market will definitely not be the same for a while as most destination weddings will be on hold. The plan is to be consistent in what I do and not let this break affect my work  keep creating more work  getting in touch with potential clients and being in the picture as an artist.” Celebrity and fashion photographer Ajay Kadam says  “All the photoshoots that were pre scheduled got cancelled which was a good 15 day of planned work. Since I had assignments which were already shot  my post retouching work is getting done from home. Once the lockdown ends  some shoots are in the pipeline so I’m positive.”  --,https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/freelance-professionals-badly-hit/story-nyyeFqDKUw1EUW9llHbdEM.html
05/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Social distancing: Tanuja Chandra on post-Pandemic urban social life,The filmmaker questions how the narrative of life will change in the coming years,The thing is  I’m a touchy-feely film director. I believe our bodies are eminently intelligent; the unspoken vitalities we emanate  these have an eloquence that all the clever verbal wizardry we toss into the air cannot hope to achieve. And so  I tend to reach out often to actors and crew - I embrace wildly  I hold hands freely  I’m given to pinching cheeks as well as the occasional pulling of hair.  This might be in part because of my expressive manner as a person  but it’s heightened on a film set. Heck  a film set itself is a heightened version of life  a tiny universe unto itself where a strong scent of mortality hangs under the lighting rigs. It’s a kind of structured lunacy with a timeline – it will end soon enough. And when such blunt temporariness stares at you  you  the beleaguered director  know that effective communication is everything. For what else is direction but thoughts  feelings  longings  expressed and received. And believe me  words don’t cut it – I’m not one to run out of words easily  and I’m telling you  words fall pitifully short.  Work-life woes Therefore folks  the question that begs an urgent response  particularly for me  is this: months down the line  when the world will no longer be the same  when the extraordinary upheaval we’re experiencing comes to be in a decline  how the hell am I going to direct? Will I flail my arms (which I do in abundance) from a distance to convey an emotion to an actor? Won’t I hold an actor (which also  I do in abundance) when they’re nervous or underconfident? Or then  while watching images of a scene unfold on a monitor  will my hand not reach out unselfconsciously to the assistant next to me noting down continuity? Will my admonishing finger no longer poke the arm of a crew member who might be shuffling his feet most annoyingly during a quiet and sensitive scene? Will I not at the end of a challenging day sling my arm over the sweaty  tired shoulder of some head of department whom I adore? Will I be mindful of not letting my throaty  massive laugh burst forth unrestricted  for fear that I might spray droplets around me  on teammates  equipment  food? How in this godforsaken  new-normal  will I direct. Social stigma How will we love  moving forward? Friends  family  lovers  staff  colleagues  strangers. Will it be incumbent on people we meet to tell us where they’re immediately or in recent days coming from? Will the host of a get-together direct guests to the bathroom to wash hands upon entry  will revelers dilly-dally a moment before sipping a pretty  blue drink handed at a bar? Will a person we find attractive sense that their charm isn’t as easily drawing our playful fingers to tap theirs  let alone the momentary dipping of the head riskily close to them when reserve really thaws? Will group selfies be less populated? Will very old humans hesitate to cuddle the young  and will newly-arrived humans be seldom gathered in our arms for a shot of instant  squeezy delight? Will goodbye hugs be summarily replaced by awkward waves? Will first dates now  include annexures to the regular set of 20 questions and will second and third engagements strictly be meals across a table or will a suitably enticed twosome amble over to a more private ambience with no second thought? Movie halls  restaurants  malls  exhibitions  literary fairs  music concerts – will their vibe ever return to its earlier abandon? If not  if a lot of the noise of the world has died down  will we then be forced to listen to each other  to ourselves? Will the tenderness at the heart of all the pain and bewilderment we’ve been feeling in these weeks and months  bring about a new kind of communication  one that’s less artifice  more truth? Where we may be able to shed all our effortful need to impress  and instead become unknowing and gentle? In my (humble) opinion  this would be restorative for film directors  I’d definitely be down for it. However  the probability of urban  social life becoming forever transformed brings me to another important (and rather more troubling) question. Will stories change?

While I’m a social human being  I’m quite comfortable being home and leading a domesticated  simple life ” shares the actor. However  Mirza  38  can’t overlook the plight of the less fortunate people in the country right now  especially the migrants. “As a citizen of the country  I feel terrible that so many people are going through such difficulties  so many are displaced and struggling on a daily basis.

That the lines of divisions and boundaries that divide us across all themes  whether it’s country  culture  religion class are all invisible right now ” she says. Mirza also feels that this has also been quite a wake-up call to all city people to actually take note of what damage they have made around them. “People are talking about how nature is getting an opportunity to heal. Us  city dwellers are collectively recognising that the air is cleaner  we hear the birds chirping and so on. Basically  nature is reclaiming spaces that we controlled completely with our activities. That aside  the larger sense of hope that this situation tells us is that we are really one entity and we belong to one home ” she elucidates.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/dia-mirza-makes-the-most-of-lockdown-i-ve-realised-i-m-quite-comfortable-leading-a-domesticate-life/story-Z9r84aeR31SiKheea0k2BL.html

And she tells us that the family is being extra cautious “given the close border proximity with worst-hit countries like Italy  Germany and Switzerland”. The actor-activist  however  says while in self-isolation  she doesn’t want to blindly join the social bandwagon of influencers spreading awareness. Instead  she’s spending the time educating her kids about Indian culture  and more. Excerpts from an interview: What’s the situation in Austria at the moment? We live nearby the new epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak where deaths and infections are constantly on the rise. We’re within a 3-4 hour proximity to worsely hit countries. Honestly  the Austrian government has been quite proactive and responsible among the entire European Union towards the management of the pandemic. Do you plan to spread awareness about this crisis through your social media? I don’t want to join the bandwagon of influencers propagating the fact that daily use of the beloved “jhaadu” can protect you from Covid-19. The cleaning has to be deeper than that with WHO (World Health Organisation) specified cleaning agents (cleaning/sanitising the surfaces as the virus can survive on surfaces/objects for a certain amount of time)  along with full precautionary isolation specifically to protect our older population  who’re vulnerable to the virus.  Season's Greetings and Merry Christmas to all of you  in every sense of the word... We can feel it again this year... Where there is family love  the true spirit of Christmas comes to life ...

We’re following that. Red peppers  citrus fruits  broccoli  carrots and garlic dowsed in organic haldi (on strict instructions of my grandmother in Lucknow) are on our daily menu. How are you helping others in need? We’ve done our bit by helping older  more vulnerable people  with their grocery shopping so that they are less exposed to the virus.

03/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,SC seeks govt response over payment of minimum wages to migrant workers,The petition filed by activists Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj pointed out that migrant workers are unable to earn their wages because of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced by the government since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.,The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday sought the response of the Central government in a plea to ensure payments of minimum wages to all migrant workers  who are either employed by companies or contractors or self-employed  within a week. The petition filed by activists Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj pointed out that migrant workers are unable to earn their wages because of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced by the government since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta posted the case for next hearing on April 7. The petitioners submitted that the lockdown order issued on March 24  for which no prior intimation was given  created a panic across the country and led to the instantaneous loss of jobs and wages of millions of migrant workers employed in establishments across the country or self-employed as street vendors  rickshaw-pullers  domestic helps  petty job workers  etc. “The (lockdown) order ignores the harsh realities that workers have to persistently face in cities that is further compounded when the order deprives them of their jobs  daily wages and as a result  means of survival  thus violating their Article 21 (Right to Life) rights ” the petition stated. Petition seeking free Covid 19 testing The SC on Friday asked the Centre for its response a petition praying that Covid-19 test should be provided free of cost to all citizens at all private and government-run testing laboratories. At present  private laboratories are allowed to charge up to Rs 4 500 to conduct Covid-19 test. “It is urgently required that the respondents have to provide free of cost Covid-19 test to all citizens ” the petition stated. Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi  who filed the plea  submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity and it has become difficult for a common man to get tested in government laboratories. The public is forced to fork out up to Rs 4 500 to get Covid-19 test done at private laboratories because of lack of options. Saddling ordinary citizens with such a financial burden effectively deprive them of their accessibility to medical facilities and is violative of Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution  the petitioner submitted. Sudhi also pointed out that there are only 114 designated centres to conduct Covid-19 test in a country that has over 1.3-billion population. He claimed that the lack of an adequate number of testing centres has prevented conducting Covid-19 test in an aggressive manner and could pose a major health hazard for the country in the coming days. He urged that testing facilities should be ramped up and pathological laboratories accredited with National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) must conduct all Covid-19 tests. SC wants strict action on price gouging of masks and sanitisers The SC on Friday asked the Centre to publicise measures taken by it to deal with price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and hand sanitisers. A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta said the government to take strict action against those flouting the price control notification issued by the authorities concerned. The apex court disposed of the case after the government told the SC on Friday that it would publicise helpline numbers for customers to reach out if they come across any violation of the price control notification. The plea by the non-governmental organization (NGO)  Justice for Rights Foundation  had claimed that there was a growing rise in demand for masks and sanitisers due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Consequently  chemists and medical shops are taking advantage of the situation and selling such commodities at a price much higher than the maximum retail price (MRP) as well as the price prescribed by the government. The petitioner had alleged that several chemists and medicine shops  in an attempt to defraud and profit from the unprecedented outbreak  were striking out the MRP of masks and sanitisers and applying their own exorbitant price tags. The government had come out with notifications and orders declaring facemasks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities and capping their prices. “The Department of Consumer Affairs  in wake of the need and the urgency of the present condition published a notification dated March 21  fixing the prices of the mask i.e. 2 ply masks to be priced at Rs 8 and 3 ply masks to priced at Rs 10 and that a 200-millilitre bottle of sanitiser to be sold at a price of Rs 100 ” the petition pointed out. The petitioner claimed that despite the notification  medicine shops were still selling masks and sanitisers at higher prices in brazen defiance of the notification. Kerala –Karnataka border: SC bats for amicable resolution The SC on Friday issued notice to the Centre and Kerala governments in an appeal filed by Karnataka challenging an April 1 order of Kerala high court (HC) directing the Central government to remove the road blockades erected by Karnataka on the Kerala-Karnataka border. The apex court did not stay the Kerala HC order but asked the chief secretaries of both the states and the Union health secretary to hold a meeting to arrive at an amicable solution in a bid to ensure movement of vehicles in case of medical emergencies. The case will be heard next on April 7. The Karnataka government had blocked the roads  including National Highway 66 connecting the state with Kerala’s northern districts  in its bid to tackle the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. It had erected mud mounds on the roads  preventing all vehicular traffic between the neighbouring states. Kerala has reported 286 Covid-19 positive cases in the country  and ranks third after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Out of the 286 cases  129 cases are from the state’s northern-most district  Kasaragod  which shares its borders with Karnataka. The Kerala High Court Advocates Association had moved Kerala HC against the blockades. On April 1  the HC noted that the national highway network comes under the Central government and had ordered it to remove the blockades. “We direct the Central government to intervene in the matter and ensure that the blockades erected by Karnataka on the national highways connecting the said state to Kerala  are removed forthwith  and without any further delay  so as to facilitate the free movement of vehicles carrying persons for urgent medical treatment  across the border between the two states ” the HC had directed.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-response-over-payment-of-minimum-wages-to-migrant-workers/story-A7q7aTTN4ZI03LaQdOITpO.html

We have kept some amount for medical contingencies for the entire team ” explains designer Gautam Gupta of label Asha Gautam. Many designers have paid these artisans working for them in the city in advance. “Our primary focus at this time is to ensure that our employees’ salaries and benefits reach them so they are able to sustain themselves at a difficult time ” says designer Rina Singh of Eka.

It has led to the deepening of the belief that the nation can unite as one in the battle against Corona. This collective spirit of yours  of the nation  can be seen manifesting itself during these times of lockdown. Friends  today  when crores of people of this country are confined to their homes  it will be natural for anyone to question what they can do just by themselves.Some people may also be worried about how they are going to fight such a big battle on their own. Many will be concerned about how many more days they will have to spend like this. Friends  this is certainly the time of a lockdown  and we most certainly are confined to our own homes  but none of us is alone.The collective strength of 130 crore Indians is with each one of us  it is the strength of each one of us.It is required for our countrymen  to from time to time experience the greatness  majesty and divinity of this collective strength. Friends  in our country the citizenry is considered a manifestation of God itself.

Friends  amidst the darkness spread by the Corona pandemic  we must continuously progress towards light and hope. We must continuously strive to take those of us most affected  our poor brothers and sisters  from disappointment to hope.

Friends  I have one more prayer in this regard  that no one must assemble or gather anywhere while participating in this program. Please do not go out on to the roads  lanes or your localities  do it at the doorstep or balconies of your own homes. One must never cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ of Social Distancing. Social Distancing should not be breached under any circumstances.This is the only panacea to break the chain of Corona virus. So  on the 5th of April at 9 PM.Sit in solitude for some time and reminisce about Maa Bharati  picture the faces of 130 crore Indians.Experience the collective resolve  the collective superpower of 130 crore Indians.This will give us the strength to fight  as well as the confidence to win  in this hour of crisis.

The two words may evoke fear and devastation in minds of others  but for the Raipur-based couple they symbolise triumph over hardships as the twins - a boy and a girl - were born during the ongoing coronavirus-enforced nationwide lockdown which has disrupted normal life. The names  they said  would remind them about all the hardships they conquered amid the lockdown  ahead of a successful delivery on the intervening night of March 26-27 at a government hospital here. However  the couple said they may change their decision later and rename their kids. I was blessed with the twins - a boy and a girl - in the early hours on March 27. We have named themCovid (boy) and Corona (girl) for now ” Preeti Verma  the 27-old mother of the newborns  told PTI. “The delivery happened after facing several difficulties and therefore  me and my husband wanted to make the day memorable. “Indeed the virus is dangerous and life-threatening but its outbreak made people focus on sanitation  hygiene and inculcate other good habits. Thus  we thought about these names ” she said  giving reasons for their unusual decision. “When the hospital staff also started calling the babies as Corona and Covid  we finally decided to name them after the pandemic ” she said. The couple  originally from Uttar Pradesh  resides in a rented house in the Purani Basti area of the state capital. “On late night of March 26  I suddenly experienced severe labour pain and somehow my husband arranged an ambulance operated under 102 Mahtari Express service. “As no vehicular movement was allowed on roads due to the lockdown  we were stopped by police at various places but they let us go after noticing my condition ” Verma said. I was wondering what would happen in the hospital as it was midnight  but fortunately doctors and other staff were very cooperative ” she said. “Our relatives  who wanted to reach the hospital  could not make it as bus and train services were stopped due to the lockdown ” said Verma  who already has a two-year-old daughter. The twins were born in Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital. Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the hospital  Shubhra Singh said  the mother and the newborns were discharged recently and they were in good health. As soon as Verma reached the hospital with her husband  arrangements were made to perform a caesarean section on her as it was a complicated case  Singh said. “Within 45 minutes of their arrival  the delivery was done successfully ” the PRO said.

03/04/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Humour does what force can’t: Policemen show their fun and quirky side,Amidst lockdown  police officers across India have come up with cool ways to deter people from stepping out,Laughter is the best medicine  even in the time of corona! In order to spread awareness about the pandemic  police officers are coming up with fun and novel ideas. Putting up a funky dance performance to demonstrate how to wash hands to fight corona virus  doing an aarti of those stepping out without a reason  singing parodies – police officers across India are exhibiting their cool  quirky side. In Bilaspur  Chhattisgarh  police officers are doing the aarti of violators to stop them from stepping out without any purpose— they are putting tika on their foreheads  showering them with flowers and circulating an aarti plate with a dia around them! Lalita Mehar  the DSP we see in the viral video performing the aarti  says  “Why use lathis when aartis work better? The purpose was to make people realise how people are putting everyone’s life at risk. They were initially puzzled but they understood and pledged to stay safe.” The police officer performs these aartis across the city along with her colleague  SHO Mohammad Kalim Khan.   SP Bilaspur Prashant Agarwal says this is a trying phase  and amid all the gloom  he wanted his team to do something positive. “We thought we should do something light hearted to urge people to stay at home. We were like  sab kuch toh try kar liya  dara liya  dhamka liya  pyar se samjha liya  ab kya arti utaarein aapki...and we literally did it! We got just the right reaction. People were embarrassed  they accepted their mistake and realised the efforts we are putting in to fight the pandemic.” The videos are being shared and appreciated in other countries as well. “We are getting calls from across the world ” shares the SP.  Bilaspur Police has also penned a cool parody to make people aware about the precautions they must take to fight COVID-19. Officers go from one locality to another singing it soulfully  and people join in from their balconies.  Bilaspur DSP Abhinav Upadhyay  who you see singing melodiously in video  says that police officers were a bit stressed  as people were posting memes mocking the police  such as ‘police waale PUBG khel rahe hain’. “Our intent is the welfare of our people. We wanted to present a counter narrative  and tell people that it will be disastrous to step out. A parody seemed perfect ” he says.  While the police officer was listening to the timeless ‘Ek Pyar Ka Naghma Hai’ from Shor (1972)  his wife  Shruti Upadhyay  suggested that they modify the song. “Within 20 minutes  we put it together. Mostly  she wrote the lines and I edited ” he shares.  The police officer was overwhelmed with emotions when he received a call from veteran lyricist Santosh Anand  the original writer of the song. “I could hardly believe when Anand ji himself called and appreciated the parody. It was a priceless moment ” he says.  Singer Daler Mehendi   who saw the videos on social media  says  “Huge respect for these officers who have taken this initiative in this critical time. It’s a great way to bring the nation and the entire human race together. Have never come across a policeman who can sing so beautifully!”  “The aarti video is the coolest that I have seen on social media. Much better than hitting anyone! What a cute  fun message  ki boss  stay at home  warna aapki bhi aarti utarenge ” says actor Sonu Sood.  Police officers in other states are also singing to urge people to stay at home. A video of a Pune police officer singing ‘Zindagi maut na ban jaye  sambhalo yaaro’ to make people aware of the crisis that we are facing  is also being shared on social media. The Kerala police had also earlier released a video of officers dancing to demonstrate how to wash hands properly to fight coronavirus.  In Chennai  the police invented a quirky way to tell people that they can’t be taking COVID-19 lightly. Police officers made violators wear coronavirus helmet (a headgear with tentacles jutting out) that resembles the virus. The police officers also made people hold placards reading “Don’t come out and go near coronavirus.” Inspector Rajesh babu himself wore one of these headgears designed by artist B. Gowtham. The police officer  hoped that people get scared of the deadly virus and do not step out without a valid reason.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humour-does-what-force-can-t/story-8kRxW8yYiwtcbMgYafptdI.html

02/04/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,Navy develops Rs 1K temperature guns for Covid-19 screening,The temperature guns will be used for screening the 20 000 personnel who visit the dockyard daily in view of the coronavirus situation and this will reduce the workload of the sentries at the gates  the navy said.,The Naval Dockyard  Mumbai  has designed and developed a hand-held infrared temperature sensor and it has the capacity to scale up production if agencies require these instruments in large numbers to screen people for fever amid the Covid-19 outbreak  the navy said in a statement on Thursday. The navy said the instrument had been developed to overcome the scarcity of temperature guns in the market where these were being sold at a very high cost.  “The instrument has been manufactured for under Rs 1 000 using in-house resources. The cost is a fraction of the price of the temperature guns in the market ” the statement said  adding that the country’s medical infrastructure was being tested by the surge in the count of Covid-19 cases. The dockyard’s temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.02 degree Celsius  it said. The temperature guns will be used for screening the 20 000 personnel who visit the dockyard daily and this will reduce the workload of the sentries at the gates  the navy said. “In view of Covid-19  initial screening of these personnel entering the dockyard was essential to prevent the spread of the disease within the yard and the navy’s Western Fleet. The most preliminary method to screen a probable patient is to check for body temperature by non-contact means ” the statement said. As the country prepares to handle a rising number of cases and meet its need for ventilators  which about 5% of the Covid-19 patients may require  the navy has also pitched in with an innovative ventilator design that can cater to six patients simultaneously. The Naval Dockyard  Visakhapatnam  has manufactured this portable multi-feed oxygen manifold ventilator. “To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic  personnel from Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold(MOM)’ using a 6-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. This innovation will enable one oxygen bottle to supply six patients concurrently thus enabling critical care management to a larger number of Covid patients with the existing limited resources ” the navy said in a statement earlier this week.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-develops-rs-1k-temperature-guns-for-covid-19-screening/story-wBvWwtv6Qg8k3Nc9IsiARJ.html

The repatriation from India is part of the massive effort being undertaken by the US for its citizens from across the world. So far  the US has repatriated over 30 000 citizens from over 60 countries on more than 350 flights.  “We began our repatriation efforts from India yesterday with a flight that brought in some 170 US citizens ” Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.  “We will begin a steadier flow of flights out of New Delhi and Mumbai in the coming days  really beginning toward the end of this week and into the weekend ” he said in response to a question.  There are more than 80 flights scheduled or in the planning stages from various locations  he added.  Reluctant to share the specific numbers which remain highly dynamic  Brownlee said the number from India is in the multiple thousands  who have indicated a possible interest in being repatriated to the US.  “We have found the Government of India has been very cooperative and very helpful with us in arranging these repatriation flights. We are thankful to them for their assistance and their support as we undertake this important mission ” Brownlee said.  The US has run into some complications with regard to its efforts in Africa because of the closures in airspaces there  he added.  In Africa  out of the 57 international airports on the continent  over 30 of them are either at restricted or no operations  and every repatriation flight is being negotiated by the country team on the ground on a case-by-case  flight-by-flight basis in a great number of the countries involved  said William Walters  Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Operations  Bureau of Medical Services in the State Department.  The United States has some 20 million people living overseas.  Walters said the Department of State was making every effort to assist US citizens overseas who wish to return to the country.  “But as the COVID-19 situation develops  our ability to provide such assistance  whether working with commercial airlines or arranging for evacuation flights  may become more limited or even unavailable ” he said.  Brownlee said that if US citizens wished to return to America  they should make arrangements to do so now  and contact the nearest embassy or consulate for assistance.  “There’s no guarantee the Department of State will be able to continue to provide repatriation assistance  and transportation options from many countries to the United States may become unavailable in the future  even in a few weeks’ time ” he warned.  Those who choose to remain overseas should be prepared to remain there for the foreseeable future  he asserted  in an indication of the gravity of the situation.  “If you were on the beach when an earthquake struck  you wouldn’t just stand there waiting for the coming tsunami. You would head for higher ground immediately. Well  in this case  the earthquake has happened. It’s time to seek higher ground now  and not hope for rescue later ” Brownlee said.  A nationwide 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 24 in India to check the spread of coronavirus as social distancing is possibly the only way to prevent people from infecting the deadly virus.  A total of 932 605 COVID-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 16 809 deaths reported so far  according to Johns Hopkins University data.

All these trains began from Delhi between March 13 and March 19 - the Duronto Express to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh  the Grand Trunk Express to Chennai  the Tamil Nadu Express to Chennai  New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express and the AP Sampark Kranti Express. While there are yet no definite numbers with the railways on the actual number of people who could have come in contact with the participants of this event  sources say that each train carried around 1000-1200 passengers and other staff members which could put them all at risk.   State officials said that the railways is providing lists of passengers to the district authorities which are being compared to the list of participants of the event to ensure contact tracing.    Of the contacts being traced  one is the case of 10 Indonesians who took the AP Sampark Kranti Express back to Karimnagar district after the event on March 13  and subsequently reported positive for coronavirus. Around 60 passengers who travelled on the New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express in the same B1 coach as a Malaysian woman who tested positive for the virus  believed to be part of the Nizamuddin Tablighi cluster  are under the scanner with the district authorities scrambling to find their whereabouts.

Both Hazrat Nizamuddin stations and the New Delhi railway station are one of the busiest railway stations in the country.    While Hazrat Nizamuddin station in Delhi  sees 56 long-distance trains departing every day and 130 trains from other sources halt here  62 trains originate and 76 trains halt at the New Delhi railway station every day.

The case against him and others has been registered under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Epidemic Diseases Act ” one of the investigating officers said on condition of anonymity. Over 400 people at the headquarters have shown Covid-19 symptoms. A joint team of police  health workers  and the World Health Organization have evacuated at least 2 361 people from congested Nizamuddin until Wednesday. They have been sent to quarantine centres and hospitals. Investigators said Saad allegedly ignored the government’s March 13 and March 16 orders banning gatherings of over 200 persons and any form of religious congregations. Officers of the Delhi Police  who are authorised to speak to the media  refused to comment on the investigations despite repeated text messages and phone calls. The TJ on Tuesday issued a statement  saying the visitors were stuck at the headquarters because of the lockdown. Its spokesman  Mohammed Shoaib  said they had sent a request for curfew passes to the Delhi government to help the visitors leave their headquarters but they received no reply. Police and government officials have been scouring 16 mosques across Delhi  where some visitors at the TJ headquarters had stayed after leaving Nizamuddin. On Tuesday  the Delhi’s Police’s intelligence gathering wing wrote to the health department asking it to take “necessary action” as the “persons/foreigners associated with Tablighi Jamaat” were staying at those placed and posed “a grave danger to public health.” Syed Shaban Bukhari  the vice-Shahi Imam (prayer leader) of Delhi’s Jama Masjid  said they have sent a message to management committees of mosques in Delhi  urging them not to panic and make it mandatory for guests to get their medical check-ups done. “We have sent the message via a WhatsApp group asking committees to ensure they get the medical check-ups of guests conducted. It is crucial for the overall safety and for containing the Covid-19 transmission” said Bukhari. Mufti Mukarram Ahmed  the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Fatehpuri Masjid  said mosques have been shut since they were ordered to do so. “We had already issued advisories asking people not to gather at mosques. The government should set up a help desk for the people who are stuck since the lockdown was imposed... [They] were not given any time to go back to their respective places.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-interrogate-tablighi-jamaat-leader-over-audio-clip-delhi-police/story-VRm02rpV0U10uuLvsVAUdP.html

01/04/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;mali,Migrants question implementation advisory on protecting wages  jobs,The migrant workers said the direction was welcome but wondered how it would be implemented on the ground even as Delhi’s labour minister Gopal Rai assured them that his government will ensure that no worker is sacked or not paid because of the coronavirus lockdown.,Nanhe Lal  52  was busy setting up a makeshift tent on Monday in the fields on the periphery of his village in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district. The tent  he said  would serve as his personal isolation ward for the next two weeks. Lal was among thousands of migrant workers from Delhi who took to the national highways on foot  soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24  in their desperation to get back home and safety—a feat he finally accomplished on Sunday night. The exodus of workers  headed to their native lands  has been witnessed across the country over the past few days. For a country like India  which has an internal migrant population of around 37% (according to the 2011 census data) the movement of migrants was of such a scale that many likened it to the exodus triggered by the Partition of 1947. Photographs by media houses and agencies showed massive gatherings at state borders  highways and bus terminals  with people desperately looking for a way to get back home. On Sunday  the Union home ministry directed states to ensure that no employer sacks these workers or deduct their wages during the lockdown period  through an advisory. The direction was welcomed by the migrant workforce but its potential for enforcement was beyond their imagination. HT later reached out over the phone to a dozen migrant workers from different states and told them about the Union home ministry’s directive. Lal was one of them. “How is that possible? We don’t have any records. How will I prove I have been sacked or my salary has been deducted?” Lal said. They said the direction was welcome but wondered how it would be implemented on the ground even as Delhi’s labour minister Gopal Rai assured workers that his government will ensure that no worker is sacked or not paid because of the lockdown. Delhi has around 1.5 million migrant labourers engaged in the unorganised sector which perennially suffers from an arbitrary—or rather malicious—record-keeping system in terms of employees on payroll. “How can any government which till date could not ensure that we receive the stipulated minimum wages suddenly enforce a crackdown on employers for terminating our employment or not paying us during this lockdown?” said Amar Ahirwar  another migrant worker who does loading and unloading of heavy machinery in Delhi’s Mayapuri industrial area. He has now reached his village in Madhya Pradesh’s Morena and quarantined at a government centre there. Rakhi Sehgal  a labour rights activist and researcher  said  “India has plenty of labour laws but for ages  they were not enforced efficiently. The result—hundreds and thousands of wrongful terminations  wage disputes  inhuman working conditions  etc. The lack of enforcement is why no migrant labourer today trusts the news that government will act against employers for wrongful termination and/or salary cut during the lockdown.” Even if the government has the right intent  how will they transform it into action  a senior official in Delhi’s labour department asked. He further said  “The task of crackdown will lie with the states. Let us take Delhi as an example. The department has 20 field officials against a sanctioned strength of 72  only five case officials against a sanctioned strength of 20. Five joint commissioners preside over courts  against a sanctioned strength of 13. Who will do the enforcement?” Animesh Das  a member of the Delhi government’s minimum wage committee  said  “The government should do four things. First  make record-keeping in the unorganised sector less arbitrary by issuing mandatory identity cards to labourers. Second  digitise the wage mechanism to strengthen the record-keeping process. Third  create a strong complaint registration mechanism for labour disputes that arise out of the lockdown. And  fourth  strengthen the labour law implementation machinery in general.” Gopal Rai said  “Right now  the priority for migrant workers is food and shelter. As far as the enforcement of the government’s directive is concerned  we will do everything to ensure that no worker is terminated or suffer a salary cut because of the coronavirus lockdown.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-question-implementation-of-govt-advisory-on-protecting-wages-jobs/story-bSJcx1l7ODCA1qgUBnG6qJ.html

01/04/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,The Taste with Vir: The decline and fall of the UPA,In his memoir Backstage  Montek Singh Ahluwalia describes how the UPA left the economy in much better shape than it has ever been under the BJP. The problem was not the economics; it was the politics.,Nobody seriously disputes that it will take the global economy a long time to recover from the Corona virus pandemic. In India  when and if the problems caused by the lockdown are solved  we will then have to return to the grim reality of the mess that our economy is already in. Even before this pandemic started  the Indian economy was in trouble. Worse still  very few people in business believed that the government had the answers or knew how to revive the economy and instil confidence in consumers. The Modi government has one all-purpose defence for this situation: we inherited a mess from the UPA. We have cleaned up the corruption but we can’t be expected to turn the economy around overnight. Montek Singh Ahluwalia was a senior governmental economic planner from the1980s onwards and has just published an excellent memoir called Backstage which  sadly  came out on the eve of the Covid crisis and has not received the sort of attention it deserves from the general public. Most of the memoir deals with the pre-UPA period and I imagine that economists and serious readers will be most interested in the part that covers the 1991 reforms  during which period Ahluwalia was a key player. But the part that interested me— given how often the BJP harks back to that period—was his description of UPA 2. Ahluwalia has always been personally close to Manmohan Singh and has many insights to offer about the UPA. How could a government that was so popular during its first term that it was re-elected with larger numbers and delivered record growth be seen as a byword for corruption and indecisiveness in its second term? If Manmohan Singh had not lost public respect so completely during UPA 2 would Narendra Modi ever have won an overall majority?  Ahluwalia gives us the usual explanations for the decline in growth during UPA2. He focuses on the global crisis that began with the fall of Lehman brothers. He thinks we did not act quickly enough to respond to the massive rise in oil prices. But after an initial pause  he argues  the economy was back on track by the end of UPA2. More unusually  he concedes that the government failed to act decisively to stop fraud in many cases. In 2011  he writes  his colleagues brought to his attention that private investors in public-private partnership projects were asking public sector banks for loans while quoting project costs that were much higher than the costs that had been approved by the government. He writes “unduly high levels of borrowing raised the suspicion that unscrupulous investors may be siphoning off the surplus amounts from the project and then recycling them back as their own equity contribution.” The Planning Commission (which Ahluwalia then headed) sent a note to both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Finance Ministry pointing this out. It took several months for the RBI to reply and say that it was aware of the dangers of ‘gold-plating’ but it could not do anything till defaults actually began. The private sector banks recognised what was going on and pulled back. But the public sector banks did not and this “was one of the factors that led to the build up of Non-Performing Assets (NPA) over time” and to today’s banking crisis where many of India’s biggest businessmen are defaulters. Ahluwalia is critical too of the way in which Suresh Kalmadi was allowed to spend thousands of crores on the Commonwealth Games and does not dispute that “Kalmadi should have been subject to tighter oversight .” To that extent  he agrees with public criticism of UPA2. But many of the other controversies that the government was involved in  he suggests  were unnecessary and often unfair. On the 2G controversy  he makes three important points. The first is that the decision to not auction 2G licenses was not the government’s alone. TRAI had recommended that new licenses should be offered for each telecom circle at the same price that the existing players had paid in 2001 to provide a level playing field. The idea was not so much to make money as to make mobiles available to many more Indians. And to that extent  the policy led to impressive results: the number of mobiles increased from 36 million in 2004 to 919 million in 2012. (Though personally  Ahluwalia had preferred an auction  he does not believe that the TRAI recommendation was dishonest or irregular.) Secondly  while he notes that A Raja  the Telecom Minister was acquitted in the 2G scam case  he lists the many strange things that Raja did while issuing the licenses: suddenly changing the dates for accepting the license applications  asking applicants to pay fees running into crores in a few hours time  etc. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the process itself was hardly a level playing field. The third and most important point is that while Raja’s conduct may have been dodgy (he was moved from the ministry in 2010)  there was never the massive telecom scam that the media wrote about. That idea of a scam originated in a notorious CAG report which most people now agree was either misleading or at worst  motivated. The CAG said that the government had made a “presumptive loss’ of Rs 1.76 lakh crore on the issuance of licenses.This was one of several possible estimates of loss contained in the CAG report  each based on a different formula. The man who headed the team that prepared the report told the JPC that his own figure was Rs 2 645 crore. This estimate was not used in the report and he said the Rs 1.76 lakh crore was added ‘by headquarters.’ Worse still  writes Ahluwalia  the media suggested that this Rs 1.76 lakh crore figure meant that somebody actually pocketed this much money  leading to the allegation that this was one of the biggest scams in the world. In fact the estimates were of how much money the government could have raised from an auction. But the public at large did not understand what a ‘presumptive loss’ was and the repeated use of the word ‘scam’ suggested that some one had stolen the money. When the licenses were eventually auctioned (after the Supreme Court cancelled the first lot of 2G licenses) the CAG’s estimate was shown up as the ridiculous figure it really was. In his own understated way  Alhuwalia blames the Supreme Court and the CAG equally for creating an atmosphere that suggested that scams were rampant and that ministers were stealing lakhs of crores. (He has similar criticisms of the CAG and the Court’s conclusions on the coal block controversy as well.) Ahluwalia believes that  under attack from the Supreme Court and the CAG  the government was so much on the defensive that it lacked the moral authority to communicate quite how much it had achieved in its second term. This is fair enough but there were other factors he does not consider. By the second term  Manmohan Singh was not quite the same person he had been during UPA I. After the election victory  hubris had set in. Relations between his PMO (possibly the single worst PMO in history) and the Congress had collapsed. Congressmen and even ministers complained that the PM was now too aloof.  Ahluwalia doesn’t consider also (perhaps for reasons of discretion) the collapse of the balance in the relationship between Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. The two had always got along but once Sonia Gandhi fell ill and spent long periods abroad  this balance was broken  never to be restored during UPA II. During UPA I  Sonia had done the political heavy lifting while Singh had run the government. Now  the people who handled the politics in her absence felt that Singh was surrounded by fools and cronies and consequently  were more and more disenchanted with him.  Singh  a decent and gentle person  had been temporarily led astray by the second election victory and believed in the slogans his supporters raised. (“Singh is King” for instance.) When things began to go wrong  he retreated into a shell  hardly communicating with the nation.  The Gandhis got it wrong too. Sonia Gandhi followed a policy of sacking anyone accused of even the slightest impropriety. This did not make her seem moral and high-minded  as she may have believed it might. Instead it contributed to the public perception that her government was full of crooks. Rahul Gandhi had been a newcomer during UPA1. But in UPA 2  he behaved badly. He had no business going public and tearing up an ordinance issued by the cabinet (with his mother’s knowledge) at a press conference. According to Ahluwalia  Rahul later apologized to Singh but the damage was done. Ahluwalia refers to how hostile the media became to UPA2. This was true but not entirely surprising. When the CAG and the Supreme Court like to make headlines with sensational claims against the government  why won’t the media repeat them? If the government handles such protests as the India Against Corruption movement and Baba Ramdev’s agitation so ineptly (and there is no doubt that Manmohan Singh did not know how to handle either) then it is an invitation for the media to go for the jugular. And there was one new factor which the UPA never understood till the end; digital and social media. The BJP had decided to portray Manmohan Singh as an ineffectual slave of the Gandhi family (the view reflected in such movies as The Accidental Prime Minister - though not in the book the film claimed to be based on) while Rahul was portrayed as an entitled moron. This message was disseminated again and again on Facebook  WhatsApp  Twitter and on readers’ comments sections on web sites. It was an innocent era and nobody in India had heard of troll farms or glove-puppets. The TV channels carried tweets on their screen and ran Twitter polls  naively believing that these reflected the voice of the people. But by the time social media was done with them  Manmohan Singh was not taken seriously and Rahul Gandhi has never been able to shake off the tag of being an immature  dynastic buffoon. So  yes Ahluwalia is correct. The UPA did get the economics right. As he shows in the book  by the end of UPA2  the economy was in much better shape than it ever has been under the BJP. But UPA2 completely screwed up the politics. And without fixing the politics there was no hope of communicating the truth about the ‘scams’ that the BJP hammered away at. Backstage is a fascinating book  clearly and simply written by one of the cleverest and smartest people to ever work for the government of India. If you care about Indian politics you can’t afford not to read it.

31/03/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Thanks to social prejudice  transgenders are a neglected lot,Transgenders are facing neglect in this distressing phase due to bias that runs deeps in the society. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment has come to their rescue,As the world fights corona virus  the survival of India’s transgender community is at stake. Most transgenders are daily earners who beg  do sex work or collect alms during weddings and child birth. The lockdown has left them with no option to eke a living. “While other daily wage earners have some social network  this is an isolated and a highly ostracized community. They don’t have a family to look after them. Many transgender don’t have Adhar card or rashan card etc to avail relief measures. They are a scattered community which makes their situation alarming ” says transgender activist Rudrani Chhetri. Chhetri says that Delhi despite being the Capital  doesn’t have a transgender welfare board. “The government recently passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act  2019. It ensures the community equal right to healthcare and welfare measures. But there’s no single window to take this up ” she adds. Many transgenders are facing starvation. Shaina  a 19-year-old transgender from Janakpuri says  “We are going without food. We have no bank account and no savings. We see people distributing rashan but no one comes to us. Even our neighbours act as if we don’t exist”. Her roommate Ria  34  says she can’t step out to get medicines. “We are scared of the police. Yesterday  we went to buy milk and policemen addressed us in a vulgar manner. There are HIV positive patients in our group who need medicines but we can’t go out as there’s no conveyance and no clarity on curfew passes. Police will beat us if we walk to the hospital ” she says. Karishma  35  another transgender who volunteers with an NGO  says it will be challenging to ensure that help reaches all. “There’s no updated data on the community. As per the last census (2011)  there were 4.88 lakh transgenders in India. No recent survey has been done. It’s going to be tough to reach out to them.” Dhananjay Chauhan  a transgender activist from Chandigarh says that those living in the deras following hijra culture still have some resources  but transgenders living on their own are facing hell. “We got rashan and vegetables from the Lalit Hotel  but it finished soon as there are so many in need.” Shashi Bhushan  LGBTQ activist says that the neglect that transgenders are facing is due to transprejudice that runs deeps in the society. “Transgenders are still considered untouchable. Their lives do no matter. NGOs must come forward now. They too are human beings and they will soon be dying ” he says. However  Veerendra Mishra  director  National Institute of Social Defence  a central advisory body for Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment says that the government has put together an immediate relief plan to help transgenders in this time of distress. Offcials are working round the clock to ensure its success. “We are releasing ₹1500 each in the accounts of 1000 transgenders across India. 3000 more people have sent us their details and we will sending them relief after verifications .

31/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,No ‘Kanya Pujan this Navratri  people donating money to relief funds,A recent trend on social media shows that many people are encouraging one another to donate the money they spend on ‘Kanya Pujan’ (a holy ritual carried out on the eighth and ninth day of the nine-day festival) to PM and CM relief funds.,At a time when people are finding it hard to do Navratri rituals freely amidst the ongoing lockdown to check spread of Sars-Cov-2  a recent trend on social media shows that many people are encouraging one another to donate the money they spend on ‘Kanya Pujan’ (a holy ritual carried out on the eighth and ninth day of the nine-day festival) to PM and CM relief funds.  This is how they are following social distancing and doing their bit to help the country contain the spread of pandemic.  Also under the present circumstances  they cannot invite little girls (kanyas) to their residence for performing the ritual due to corona threat.  The ceremony primarily involves the worship of nine girls  representing the nine forms of Goddess Durga.  Every year  homemaker Neeta Agarwal would look forward to hosting ‘Kanya Pujan’ during Navratri. But this year  she decided not to risk lives of any girls. Instead  she will contribute Rs 121 to CM relief fund in the larger interest of the society. “We decided not to organise ‘Kanya Bhoj’ because of social distancing. There is no point risking lives of girls. Instead  we will give this money to government relief fund to be utilised in our fight against Covid-19 outbreak ” said Neeta. She said her husband also supported the idea. Sudha Rai  a retired government school teacher  said she too voluntarily decided to donate the money to government relief fund. “If people wish to give Rs 11 each to 11 girls  the total amount comes to Rs 121. And if all this money gets transferred to relief account  it will help ” said Rai  a resident of Gomti Nagar extension. Mahant Divya Giri of Mankameshwar temple in Lucknow has given a call to contribute the money which they intend to give during ‘Kanya Pujan’ to government relief fund. Her video appeal message has gone viral. She said population of UP was around 23 crore. “Of them  even if 2 crore people decide to give Rs 121 each to government relief fund  the total amount will come around Rs 242 crore which is a decent contribution and will help fight Covid-19 ” she added. “We appreciate the idea as temples are closed and girls can’t be invited. So  residents can donate this money for a bigger cause of fighting corona virus ” said Dheeraj Saxena  president of Shri Om Sewa Samiti which manages a temple in Alambagh.  Lucknow’s municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said  “Many residents are donating money to Annada Fund for feeding the poor during the lockdown. Also  many people have contacted us to donate floor  rice and vegetables etc.They say this is the best way to worship ‘Maa Durga’. I am amazed to see such a spirit among people.” Uncertainty over ‘Kanya Pujan’ in Gorakhpur Chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave a miss to Holi celebration and chose to stay away from ‘Shobha Yatra’ thereby breaking the decades’ old tradition of Gorakhnath temple on March 9 owing to Covid-19 outbreak.  And now there is uncertainty on whether he will lead ‘Kanya Pujan’ at Gorakhnath temple or not. Temple authorities also made it clear that Kanya Pujan programme will be conducted as usual and it would be led by officiating chief priest Yogi Kamal Nath if the CM doesn’t come. Devotees in Varanasi urged to follow social distancing In Varanasi  Pt Prasad Dikshit says people themselves are avoiding contacting pundits for puja this Navratri. He has appealed to people not to invite girls for ‘Kanya Pujan’. “It is the moral duty of the pundits that they should also follow social distancing and avoid visiting houses of their ‘yajmans’ (clients) ” he said. Pt Ramkrishna Mishra of Mangalkaran Hanuman temple says this year he has avoided entertaining requests for puja. He also said many people would be performing symbolic ‘Kanya Pujan’ with just one girl to avoid gatherings.

31/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;nepal,Covid-19 crisis: At 32 per million  India lags far behind on testing,Health officials in Kerala said that much more tests was a reason for the state  with population of 34.8 million  reporting highest number of Covid cases in the country.,Kerala  which accounts for 3% of the country’s population  has carried out nearly 7 000 tests for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) while Uttar Pradesh  which has the highest number of people among any Indian state  has tested only 2 824 samples – numbers that indicate how some states are farther behind in getting a sense of the outbreak than others.  Data shows that populated states such as Bihar  West Bengal  Jharkhand  Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have  as compared to Kerala  conducted fewer Covid-19 tests in absolute numbers as well as tests per million population -- a strong argument for relaxing the testing criteria that is largely responsible for the low numbers across the country. Health officials in Kerala said that much more tests was a reason for the state  with population of 34.8 million  reporting highest number of Covid cases in the country. Kerala has conducted 6 690 tests  highest for any state in the country  and has also decided to conduct rapid tests  which can identify the possible carriers of the coronavirus. Kerala has also put 151  370  as on Sunday  under home and institutional quarantine. According to Kerala health department officials  after the first Covid-19 cases were detected in January  the government insisted on getting the tests conducted as regional virology institute in Alapuzha. From mid-February  tests started there and three more labs were operational by end of March  when most of the states had just one Covid-19 testing lab. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic “It’s contract-tracing and surveillance mechanisms are good. But we wish Kerala could have done more tests by now as some areas of the state have turned pandemic zones. It has to raise the number of tests immediately ” said Dr Rajgopal Kamath  science writer and researcher. In comparison  India’s most populated state  Uttar Pradesh  with the population of 200 million  only 2 284 samples have been tested  of which 2 171 have been negative. There are eight testing labs in the state including King George’s Medical University (KGMU)  LLRM Medical College in Meerut  Aligarh Muslim University in Aligarh and Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.  The calculations for cases per million has been done with data from the 2011 Census Surya Kant  head of department of respiratory medicine  KGMU  said the number of tests done were less in UP as the numbers of travelers from foreign countries in the state were less as compared to Maharastra and Kerala. “Many traveler who came via Mumbai and New Delhi airports  were first screened there. In the coming days  we will see increase in testing ” he said. Dr PK Gupta former president IMA  Lucknow  said the government should focus more on identify those with symptoms. “Selecting the correct person for test will ensure infection does not spread fast. I think number of tests will go up in the coming days as more people have entered UP ” he said. West Bengal  with population of 91 million  and 20 Covid-19 cases and one death has conducted 389 tests.  Chief minister  Mamata Banerjee  blamed the Centre saying the kits were not available  governor  Jagdeep Dhankhar  on Sunday claimed the Centre has provided 10 000 coronavirus kits to the state. State health officials  however  said there was shortage of RNA extraction kits  needed to identify the new strain of corona virus. There are six laboratories including a private one to conduct tests in Bengal and five more are waiting for approval from the ICMR. Dr Sumon Poddar  associate professor  Institute of Child Health  Kolkata  however  said most of the tests were limited to urban areas even though flow of migrant labourers to rural Bengal has increased in the past few days. “Tests help to identify Covid-19 hotspots quickly and that is the reason the WHO has been asking governments to conduct as many tests as possible ” he said.  Bihar with population of 90.9 million and 15 Covid-19 cases has conducted 792 tests. Two labs in the state capital  Patna  are authorised to conduct the tests. Bihar Covid-19 nodal officer  Dr Ragini Mishra  defended the low number of tests saying they were following health ministry’s guidelines. “The guidelines do not suggest taking samples of those who are asymptomatic ” she said. Dr Ajay Kumar said less than 800 samples tests were “far too inadequate” for a populated state like Bihar. “The state has not been able to thoroughly test the 1 lakh-plus migrant labourers who returned during the lockdown period. Our people work in Maharashtra  Kerala and UP  which are among some of the worst Covid-19 affected states in India. Moreover  Bihar also shares an open border with Nepal ” he said.  The number of samples for testing has increased since March 24  when the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) became the second centre to commence real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  a confirmatory test for novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Madhya Pradesh with 72.6 million people  have tested 525 samples till March 28 at the two labs --- AIIMS  Bhopal and NIRTH  Jabalpur. “If small state like Kerala can test 500 persons every day  why can’t MP test at least 1 000 persons every day. Kerala has as many as 16 labs whereas Madhya Pradesh had only two labs till a couple of days back ” said Amulya Nidhi  director of Jan Swashthya Arogya  a social organisation working in the field of health.  Additional director  department of health  Sapna Lovanshi  said  “We are having five laboratories now. Our department is taking all the measures to test all the samples collected and control spread of the virus as per guidelines of the central and the state governments.” Jharkhand  which has so far not reported a single positive case of Covid-19  has tested only 196 persons  lowest in the country along with much smaller and sparsely populated Himachal Pradesh. Giving the reason  Dr Manoj Kumar  head of Ranchi based Rajender Institute of Medical Sciences microbiology department  said they have not noticed any spurt in Covid-19 cases in the past one week.”If we needed  we can scale up the testing ” he said. Most state health departments are  however  increasing the capacity to conduct tests.  Punjab  which is conducting  160 tests every day in two labs  plans to increase it to 400 every day by next week. Principal Secretary  Medical Education and Research  M Tiwari  said the machines will come by March end to increasing the testing capacity. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday said there was no shortage of kits to conduct tests and the state has the highest number of Covid-19 testing centers at 11  apart from sample collection centers spread across the state. Karnataka has conducted 3170 tests so far.  Telangana chief minister K C Rao said testing has been increased around 50% since March 24 and it will further go up in the next few days. Andhra Pradesh will also increase tests from present 251 to close to 1 000 by next week.  “Given the lack of adequate testing facilities and expensive kits  it is not possible to test every suspect. If the facilities are increased  the governments can do random testing to ensure that there is no spread of the disease ” Hyderabad based health expert  M Somasekhar  said. However  the state health department officials assured that the number of tests would be increased in the coming days if there is spurt in Covid-19 cases and new hotspots emerge. Kasargod in Kerala  Indore in Madhya Pradesh  Bhilwara in Rajasthan and Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar district of Punjab are some of the identified Covid-19 hotspots in India.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-of-india-s-biggest-states-have-abysmal-testing-numbers/story-8CoLZEmBG6NxKc0Z3BI9KI.html

30/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Lockdown Diaries: Corona Blues by Bulbul Sharma,You might have longed for endless leisurely days but when there is no other option  fear takes over,Twelve hours before the lockdown was imposed all over India  I was fortunate enough to get away to my home in the hills of Himachal Pradesh. The roads were empty and the usual eight-hour journey took us only six hours. Now here I am sitting on top of a remote mountain village with only a few goats for company. My nearest neighbour is two kilometres away on another hill and sometimes we wave to each other but do not venture out. On the first day  strolling happily amongst the fruit trees in full bloom  I thought I was so fortunate to be in my orchard instead of locked down  sad Delhi. I sat under my favourite magnolia tree and felt like Little Miss Muffet  eating freshly made butter  newly harvested peas and wild rice. The clear blue sky shone above the mountains that still had a sprinkling of snow. I began rereading my old books and opened the first page of “A Suitable Boy” once more with a feeling of joyful anticipation. Though the electricity is erratic in this remote area  I managed to watch an old Miss Marple movie. When darkness fell and all was eerily silent as it always is in the mountains  I listened to music. A faint  nagging fear of what will happen lurked in my head but I soon fell asleep when the nightjar began to call out in its soothing  repetitive notes.  Gradually  as days passed  the feeling of being the last person on earth began to creep in. Now  on the fifth day of the lock down  I long for a bit of pavement; I need the sights and sounds of a city. All the things that annoyed me earlier in Delhi  I miss terribly now. I want to hear the dreadful noise of speeding traffic  shrill voices of strangers talking loudly and I even wish I could see the odd auto rickshaw brawl on the road.  The jungle crow calls raucously above my head and a child shouts loudly in the village far way. Someone is playing a flute on the hills beyond and the wind carries the melodious sound to me in broken fragments. I feel less lonely for a few moments. One always longed for these endless leisurely days when one could write all day or read an entire book in one sitting  lounging under a tree but when you know there is no other option  a strange fear takes over; a kind of reverse agoraphobia. Suddenly I want to be surrounded by a crowd of people. I want the comfort of strangers. What if I cannot go back to Delhi for months? When will be able to see my children  my grandchildren  my brother and my sister and my friends again? When will I be able to eat something else besides dal and roti? What if the little village shop runs out of atta  rice and dal?  Little petty thoughts  mostly about food and clothing  swirl in my head. I wish I had packed in less of a hurry and not filled my car with a pile of electronic gadgets like my Kindle  iPad  laptop  hairdryer  various chargers and brought instead a giant bottle of chili pickle  20 packets of ‘chikki’  10 pairs of socks  and my favorite shawl. To torture and reprimand myself I make a long list of things I should have brought. I dream of shops glittering with food stuff though not sure if it is Khan Market or Khanna Market. 21 days is a long stretch of time when you yearn desperately for the company of loved ones  familiar streets and dark chocolate.  As I wallow in self pity  I see myself drowning in this well of self–isolation that I feel will never end. 21 days seems like a life imprisonment. I cannot really bring myself to do anything constructive. Deadlines loom ahead but my ennui forces me into a dark corner. Simple cooking is all I can manage to do to break the monotony of long   lonely days. The television does work here off and on and whenever I catch the news I recoil with horror. How can I complain when thousands of people are going through such a horrific time in India and rest of the world? The sight of migrant labour  hungry and bewildered  walking for hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes fills me with anger and deep sorrow. How did no one foresee that this would happen? Then I see people helping them and various NGOs arranging food for them on the roads and my faith is restored. I get in touch as soon as I get a mobile signal and pledge to help.  I know it is a small gesture but we must all do something. We have to reach out to one another even when we are in isolation  separated from family and friends by long distances. People often criticize social media but where would we have been without those messages from friends  useful and useless advice and even silly jokes on Facebook?  When the sun rises over the hills each morning and the mist clears  I gaze at the empty roads. Then I see the farmers tending their fields of wheat. Some villagers are planting new seedlings that will be ready in two months. A faint flicker of hope rises in me. This too shall pass. The flowers on the apricot tree have now turned into tiny green fruit and the peach blossoms are rich with nectar. Nature’s endless cycle of bounty will carry on regardless of any Corona virus and as the earth renews and regenerates itself  somehow we will get through these dismal  dark days. We will emerge stronger  families will become closer after this ordeal and we will learn to appreciate every little good thing  however small or insignificant  that comes our way. I have started knitting a scarf with left over bits of wool and hope to finish it in 21 days. No takers as yet for this misshapen scarf but I wait and I hope. Stay home. Stay safe.

30/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,A legend is gone: Chefs pay tribute to Floyd Cardoz,Popular chef Floyd Cardoz  who was known for re-imagining Indian cuisine  died last week after testing positive for corono virus on March 18.,Legendary international chef and restaurateur Floyd Cardoz succumbed to Covid-19  on Wednesday. The Mumbai-born  New York-based chef had tested positive for coronavirus on March 18. The brain behind the famed NYC restaurants Tabla and Bombay Bread Bar  that later shut down  Cardoz was known for re-imagining Indian cuisine  artistically marrying Indian culinary traditions with global sensibilities. The chef  59  was in India in the first week of March to launch Bombay Sweet Shop  his latest venture in Mumbai. He already had two restaurants — Bombay Canteen and O Pedro — in the city. Chef Manish Mehrotra  who met him at the launch  says he couldn’t have imagined that it was their last meeting. “We met in the afternoon. He seemed perfectly fine. He flew back to the US after the launch. I used to meet him so often at events and I ate frequently at his restaurants. When I was opening Indian Accent in New York  he was very helpful. He introduced me to his suppliers. I will remember him as the pioneer of modern Indian food. He was the first one to boldly experiment with Indian food in the US. He was a true Indian-international chef  loved by the likes of Daniel Boulud and David Chang ” says Mehrotra. Disturbed by Floyd’s demise  chef Ranveer Brar says  “I don’t know what to say. It’s numbing. I always held him in awe. When I was living in the US  Tabla was the place to be. If you had anything to do with modern Indian food  the first thing you did was to seek an audience with chef Floyd. For me or any other Indian chef who has worked in the US between 2000-2010  he’ll always be the godfather of modern Indian cuisine.” Chef Sanjeev Kapoor says that we have lost a shining star of Indian cuisine who put our food on the world map. “Floyd Cardoz was the torch bearer of fine Indian cuisine across the globe. He will be missed immensely ” says Kapoor. Chef Vikas Khanna remembers him as a chef who uninhibitedly carved the path for culinary innovations. “He was a legend  a friend  a visionary ” says Khanna. Chef Ritu Dalmia met him whilst he was setting up Bombay Canteen in 2015. “It will remain a cherished meeting. A common friend — author Faith Willinger — introduced us. We had lunch at Gajalee and had a great time. He was supremely talented. He was a brilliant man. It’s such a saddening loss ” says Dalmia. Chef Nishant Choubey recalls meeting Floyd last year in Mumbai. “His zest for food was so inspiring. ‘Stick with whatever food you love but never miss what locals eat ’ he would say. He had such positive energy. And he added that dose of avant-garde to Indian cuisine! He’ll always be immortal ” he says.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/a-legend-is-gone-chefs-pay-tribute-to-floyd-cardoz/story-mbF6gvXzP9BRZR5ImNenyN.html
30/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Facing The virus of hate,People from the Northeast continue to be foolishly targeted after the coronavirus outbreak,Amidst the corona virus scare  we see prejudice rearing its ugly head once again. There have been reports of people from the Northeast being stupidly blamed for the spread of the pandemic. Incidents of hate have been reported from across India. Recently  a 20-year-old student from Manipur was spat on in the Capital by a man who called her ‘corona’. Another North Easterner  Oinam Devi was targeted by a man in a departmental store in Chennai  who told her that she “neither looked Indian  not behaved like one”. Angellica Aribam  a Delhi political activist was also abused and harassed on Twitter after she commented on a minister’s tweet  suggesting her to address certain issues. Many called her ‘Chinki’ and asked her to wash her hands. These derogatory comments lead her to file a complaint with the cyber crime cell. Aribam says it’s extremely disheartening to be discriminated in her own country. “I came to Delhi when I was twelve  I’m now 28 and I have faced discrimination throughout. This is the time to fight the virus together  but some people are just spreading hate. I have filed a Zero FIR and have also reported this to the cyber crime unit. They have approached Twitter and they will get back to me ” says Aribam. Designer Jenjum Gadi says he could see this coming. “I knew this was going to happen. Even before the lockdown  I was very careful. I didn’t want to give anyone a chance to harass me. I made sure I didn’t go close to anybody. Even while running in the park  I make sure to maintain distance. Otherwise somebody will call me corona. This thought keep playing in my mind. It’s sad ” says Jenjum. Gadi says he doesn’t really care much about such kind of discrimination  as he has ‘become thick skinned’. “But this corona thing is different. People are dying  there is a lockdown and in middle of all this  when somebody calls you corona you can imaginw how you will feel! Imagine the trauma of those who are victims of this ignorant discrimination ” says Gadi. Incidents of racist attacks are being reported from Delhi University as well.  A Delhi University student from Nagaland was also called at the metro station. “I was wearing a mask  and I was waiting in the line to buy a ticket. Two boys came up close behind me and started saying corona corona. I was really angry. I confronted them and they smiled. I told them that they can be punished for racism.” The student reached out to the Metro police for help  but was told to contact the customer care desk. “I am Indian  and I am a north-easterner. It hurts when people of my own country treat me badly. It’s not just me  five of my friends from the North East have been made fun of during the outbreak ” he says. Another Delhi University student pursuing Masters in History from DU was about to board a flight to Guwahati  when five men pointed at her and shouted  “Yeh dekho Coronavirus!.” The student says  “I was shocked. It took time for all of this to register. The men were giggling. I was extremely hurt.” Both the DU students said that despite having been made the target of cruel Coronavirus jokes  they didn’t get any assistance from concerned authorities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/facing-the-virus-of-hate/story-URQok0BQyq6JCeO7ioIWHJ.html
30/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Differently-abled doctors being denied exemption from during Covid-19 lockdown: Activist,A government order to exempt doctors with disabilities from work during the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown is not being followed said Dr Satendra Singh of Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change  a disability rights group.,Despite a government order to exempt people with disabilities from work during the ongoing lockdown  health care personnel with disabilities across several states have complained of being pushed into service since the sector is part of the essential services. On March 27  the department of personnel and training (DoPT) issued an order that all ministries and departments  while drawing up a roster of staff required to attend essential services within their respective ministries and departments  should keep in mind that persons with disabilities are exempted. The DoPT’s order to exempt doctors with disabilities  however  is not being followed said Dr Satendra Singh of Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change  a disability rights group. “In many states in government run as well as private hospitals doctors and other healthcare personnel are not being allowed to remain home; despite the fact that most of them have either co-morbid conditions or have low immunity. Disabled doctors also face a lot of problems navigating  because they need to hold on to railings will walking which makes them susceptible to catching infections ” he said. HT spoke to three doctors with disabilities in two states who claimed their departments turned down their request to work from home. “In my department we are doing only minimal invasive procedures  since aerosols are prohibited because of the threat of infection  there is very little we can do. But it is difficult to maintain protocol for distancing ” said a dentist who has been denied leave. A second doctor who is wheelchair bound said  her leave has also been turned down; even though the department she works for has scaled down operations substantially. “The OPDs are not running to capacity  yet we are being forced to show up. I understand this is a health emergency  but my specialization does not even require me to see patients who test positive for corona virus. However  being the hospital exposes me to risks and my wheelchair that goes everywhere in the hospital can become a mode of contamination for my family ” the second doctor said. A third doctor  also a wheelchair user said the doctors have to work with minimal PPEs  increasing their risk of catching the infection. Two of these doctors are attached to government-run hospitals. Referring to the gap in supplies of PPEs  Singh said it makes imminent sense for hospitals to allow their health care staff to work in batches. “This is a health emergency and we need all hands on the deck  but the doctors need to be protected as well ” he said. In a letter to the union ministry of health and family welfare  Singh said the number of health care personnel present during the procedure should be limited to only those essential for patient care and procedure support. “Professionals with disabilities may be exempted while performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures  work restriction and sick leave policies for them should be non-punitive  flexible  and consistent with disability accommodations as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act  2016 ” the letter sent on March 22 said. An official of the social justice and empowerment ministry  the nodal ministry for issues related to disability said  “Our guidelines are clear; those with visual impairment and severe disability should be exempt from service. Hospital administrations will take a call on how to interpret this.” On Saturday  the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPwD) under the ministry urged the union home ministry to ensure minimum support services during the lockdown period. In a letter to the home secretary  DEPwD said persons with disabilities are very vulnerable in situations of risk  need continuous care and support and many of them are dependent on caretakers. It has demanded that a letter for issuance of instructions to law enforcement authorities in the states and UTs to take immediate steps to issue passes to the caregivers of persons with disabilities on a priority basis.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differently-abled-docs-being-denied-exemption-activist/story-WfB3HC0qCOXFqllcNAOsrJ.html

The school should take this decision on humanitarian ground ” the HRD minister said. He said some states have issued order in this regard. “I have sought the orders from these states. After studying them  an order in this regard will be issued soon in the state ” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced nation-wide 21-day lockdown effective from March 24 midnight. Jharkhand government  however  had imposed state-wide lockdown to check the spread of highly infectious Corona virus from midnight of March 22. Private school authorities say they would have to think on it  as teachers’ salaries come from tuition fees of students. When principal of Guru Nanak Public School (GNPS)  Ranchi  Manohar Lal was contacted  he said they would think on the issue after re-opening of the school. “We will discuss it with management. Since teachers get salaries from the tuition fees ofstudents  we have to think on it comprehensively ” he said. Jharkhand State Educational Research and Training (JSERT) has recently decided to promote all the students studying in government schools from class-5 to class-7 to higher classes without any examinations. The examinations for these classes were scheduled from March 30  which has been suspended. More than 15 lakh students from class-5 to class-7 would be benefitted from the decision of JSERT. Jharkhand government also asked to ensure that students should not be deprived of benefit of mid-day meal during the lockdown period. The rice prescribed under mid-day manual should be delivered at doorsteps of the students. However  teachers are finding it difficult to implement it. “We have to distribute rice allotted for March 17 to March 31 and April 1 to April 14 among students. A primary student (class-1 to class-5) will get 2-kg of rice  while students ofclass-6 to class-8 will get 3-kg of rice during this period ” said Sanjay Dubey  member of Ekikrti Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM). He said it was a risky task. “If we call the students to school  it will be violation of lockdown. We are ready to go door to door for the task. But  we need safety gear  as we have to move village to village and door to door for the task. When we visit any village  villagers do not allow us at the time of lockdown ” he said.

28/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Rude Food by Vir Sanghvi: Those were the days,The beginnings of India’s restaurant sector bring back memories of the glory days of Connaught Place  Park Street and Churchgate Street,When you want to tell how old a tree is  you cut it open and look at the rings inside the trunk. Count the rings and you will know the age of the tree. When you want to know how old a restaurant-goer is  you don’t have to do anything quite as drastic as cutting him open. You just ask him a few key questions. For instance  you ask him what a ‘finger chip’ is. Or: you ask if you are supposed to fry the bun for a hamburger . Or: what kind of Indian curry is garnished with a boiled egg cut into quarters and dollops of cream? Or: what is the right way to cook a keema cutlet? Or: even  what is the greatest dish of “Continental Cuisine”? Then  you check the answers. A “finger chip” is a French Fry made with desi potatoes cut into fat wedges.  The bun in a mutton hamburger must always be (at least lightly) fried. All Indian curries should be garnished with hard boiled eggs and cream. A keema cutlet must be shaped into a flat escalope  must have a bone (any long bone will do) stuck into its side  be coated in bread crumbs and then fried. And the greatest dish of Continental Cuisine? Why  that’s easy! Chicken A ‘la Kiev. Everybody knows that. If somebody got none of the answers right  you are dealing with a millennial. If they got three out of five  then your subject is in their 30s or 40s. And four right answers or more means that you are quizzing an old bore like me. Sometime in the 1980s  the food at restaurants in India began to change. But  from around 1950 to the 1980s  a certain kind of restaurant dominated Indian cities. And even smaller towns had slightly more down-market versions of the same kind of restaurant. In Mumbai  Delhi and Calcutta  the restaurants were concentrated in a few select areas: in individual streets even. In Delhi  Connaught Place boasted of such places as United Coffee House  Kwality  Gaylord  Volga and Embassy. In Mumbai  you went to Churchgate Street to go to Talk Of The Town (or Café Parisienne before that)  Berry’s  Napoli  and Gaylord. In Calcutta  Park Street was regarded as the centre of the universe with such places as Trincas  Moulin Rouge  Peter Cat  Blue Fox and (further down the road) Sky Room. These restaurants could be very different from each other. But they all had a few things in common. For a start  most of them were owned by Punjabis. They were usually multi-cuisine. They were open all day  unlike today’s specialty restaurants. You could walk in at 4 pm and be served a sumptuous lunch. The waiters were often not paid proper salaries but told to live on tips. (A disgraceful practice that was later abandoned.) And the menus were — if not nearly the same — drawn from the same basic stock of dishes.  Many of these restaurants are now extinct : the new five star hotels  the fast food joints and globalisation polished some of them off. But many still remain. And the best ones have managed to secure the custom of an entirely new generation. I went  a fortnight ago  to the United Coffee House in Delhi’s Connaught Place to meet Akash Kalra  the third generation owner. My calculation was that  given the time (five in the afternoon) and the corona virus scare  the restaurant would be empty and we would be able to have a quiet chat. In fact  the place was jam-packed and we had to escape to a quieter spot on the mezzanine floor. The restaurant serves around 400 people a day from a vast A’la carte menu and the guests are not all longtime regulars; I counted at least eight tables of people in their 20s. This is not how I remember United Coffee House. When I was a child  it was the restaurant of choice for Lefties/Congressis and Punjabi intellectuals of all description. Several of my parents’ friends and acquaintances would go there every single day  drink endless cups of coffee (if you ordered a Cona coffee  then refills were free)  discuss the state of the world and then scatter to have lunch at their own homes. I asked Kalra about the old days. His family’s is not the usual refugees-made-good story. His grandfather maintained parallel establishments in Punjab and in Delhi. He ran a liquor business from Sialkot and opened an American-style restaurant in Chandni Chowk during the Second World War to cater to US and British soldiers. In 1942  the Kalras realised that Connaught Place would become the new centre of Delhi. They opened United Coffee House as a restaurant that only sold coffee and a few snacks. At that time  there were hardly any restaurants in Connaught Place (Volga probably predated them) and then  as Connaught Place took off  their coffee house began to do so well that they transformed it into a full-fledged restaurant. I asked Kalra how the menu developed. His answer surprised me. Till the late 1950s  he said  the customers who could afford to eat in the Connaught Place restaurants were not Punjabis. They were the older residents of Delhi; Mathurs  banias and the like. Many were vegetarian so the Connaught Place restaurants were run by Punjabis to feed the non-Punjabi Delhi elite (who they were later to supplant) from a largely vegetarian menu. At the same time  Delhi was also the home of two evolving culinary traditions. The Muslim cuisine of Delhi (which claimed to be descended from the Mughals) was growing in popularity. At the same time  the tandoori tradition popularised by Moti Mahal was also spreading across the city and eventually  all over India. But the Connaught Place restaurants were largely immune to those trends. They installed tandoors  of course  and United Coffee House created its own version of Butter Chicken  which is still on the menu. (I tried it. More cream than the original and not boneless but a little like the Daryaganj version which claims to be a replica of the Moti Mahal original.) The non-vegetarian food they served followed a different pattern. In essence  they took the food of undivided Punjab (which included Muslim influences)  tarted it up with all kinds of fat (butter  oil  cream etc.) and then  because it seemed wrong to serve it home-style in a fancy restaurant  created fancy garnishes – strips of ginger  coriander leaves  wedges of boiled egg  puddles of cream  etc. for every single Indian dish.  This tradition developed largely in isolation from the Delhi/Lucknow style of cuisine and though such names as Mughlai were regularly employed  the food was roughly as authentically Mughal as Daler Mehndi. Initially  the Western dishes were meant for foreign guests. In Kalra’s case  his father  who had lived abroad and was fascinated by French food  knew what he was doing. But most of the Punjabi restaurateurs had no clue what real European food was like. They fell back on the cuisine of the Raj Clubs and tried to re-imagine those dishes from a Punjabi perspective. That’s why there were so many club-style cutlets on the menu. To make these keema cutlets seem fancier  they took to inserting a ceremonial bone into the keema.  The flavours of the European food they served were dictated by the cooks  most of whom were Gomes cooks from Calcutta who had ruled Clubland for decades. The Punjabi restaurateurs explained to them that Indian guests (unlike the goras in the clubs of old) liked everything fried and all fat was welcome. This advice led to the rise of Chicken Kiev  because a) it was crumbed and fried  b) it had butter in the centre which made it fattier and c) when you cut into it  the butter spurted out. Chicken Kiev is always inauthentic (the dish was probably invented in New York in the 1920s) so I don’t see why the Gomes-Punjabi versions should not take their place alongside other Chicken Kievs. In its day  it epitomised what Indians imagined was “Continental Cuisine”.  So it was with the hamburger. Even in the bad old days before Achche Din dawned  Punjabi restaurateurs were always reluctant to put beef on the menu. So they used a mutton patty (if they were lazy they used a shammi kabab) instead of the real thing. But how could they make a burger more interesting to Indians? Answer: fry  fry and fry again.  So the hamburgers of Connaught Place and Churchgate Street consisted of fried goat patties sandwiched between two sides of a fried bun. When McDonald’s and the rest got here  the older restaurants hurriedly stopped frying their buns (and made them larger) but I kind of preferred the old version. Kalra made one for me at United Coffee House and it was as delicious as I remembered and he slathered the bun with onions sautéed in tomato ketchup. Kalra has given up on fat finger chips by the way  because the fast food chains have taught Indians what French fries should be like and most restaurants have switched to frozen pre-cut fries. Unlike most restaurants though  United Coffee House makes its own hand cut  house cooked wafers/crisps and they are delicious. When I planned to write this column  I wanted it to be an eulogy to the old Punjabi-owned restaurateurs. But after I saw the crowds at United Coffee House  I hastily abandoned that plan.  Don’t cry for the old war horses. They are still fighting fit. Even if they no longer make finger chips!

27/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;jersey;oman,Floyd Cardoz: The Final Wave,Each time I think of Floyd  my final image is of him waving goodbye as I drove away from the Bombay Sweet Shop. The restaurant community has lost a legend. And the world has lost a very good human being.,We live in strange times. On the one hand  because I am confined to my house  I no longer notice what day of the week it is: Wednesday is not very different from Sunday. In that sense  time has stood still or become nearly irrelevant. On the other hand  time is simultaneously also galloping ahead. It is hard to believe just how much our lives have changed in a matter of days. On 7 March  when most people thought that everything was okay  I went to the new Bombay Sweet Shop to talk to Sameer Seth  Yash Bhanage and Floyd Cardoz about the fifth anniversary of Bombay Canteen which they had started. Because I am married to a woman who had long been convinced that Corona was a much bigger deal than the government realised  I found a relatively isolated part of the restaurant and made sure that the three of us did not sit too close together. The interview went fine. I said goodbye to Floyd who said he was flying back to New York later that night. I teased him that despite his fame in New York  he was a much bigger success in India. Why not come home? I said. Why not just work fulltime with his Bombay Canteen group? Floyd looked at me a little suspiciously and then turned to Yash and Sameer and asked “Did you put him up to it?” It turned out that Floyd’s partners had been trying to persuade him to do the same thing. Surely  what they were suggesting made sense?  Floyd conceded that perhaps it did. “Let’s see when I am next in India”  he said. “Maybe I should move here full time”. The interview over  we got up to go. (No handshaking because I had been told to be careful!) I got into my car. Floyd waved goodbye. I never saw him again. Ten days later  on 17 March  Sameer called to say that Floyd had admitted himself to a hospital in New Jersey because he had respiratory symptoms. Floyd thought it might be Corona but his partners believed he should not assume the worst until the test results came back. Sameer’s view (and apparently Floyd’s too) was that he had either picked up the Corona infection on the flight (via Frankfurt) or that he had got it in New York. Neither Yash nor Sameer had any symptoms; nor did anybody else who worked at their restaurants. But Sameer still felt he had a duty to tell anyone who had spent time with Floyd so that we could consider taking some steps to protect ourselves. I had come back from meeting a friend that day  having already taken care to sit far apart in an open space. I told Sameer that I would just totally isolate myself now. It had already been ten days  and no symptoms had manifested themselves but ten more days of isolation would do no harm. Two days later Sameer called to say that Floyd had tested positive for Coronavirus. It had now been 12 days since I had met Floyd. Sameer was concerned about the safety of his team (apart from his own health). But nobody had developed symptoms  he said. They were told by doctors that tests were necessary (and available) to anyone who had developed symptoms so his team was closely monitoring their own health. The restaurants had closed a few days before.  I said that I was in isolation till 27 March anyway. (Doctors reckon that three weeks of self-isolation should be okay though some say that if you are asymptomatic after 14 days  the chances of being infected are very low). Then  of course  the whole country was put into isolation anyway so I suspect I will be at home for the foreseeable future.  On the night of 25 March  Sameer called again. He sounded devastated. Floyd had died  he said. Then the tributes started pouring in. The world’s best chefs acknowledged Floyd’s greatness. Daniel Humm said on Instagram: “Speechless  heartbroken. RIP my brother  your game changing contribution will live on forever”. David Chang who had shot with Floyd last year for his show. Ugly Delicious  tweeted. “I don’t want to believe this! Easily one of the most beloved people in the business.” Indian chefs were fulsome in their praise. From Suvir Saran to Vikas Khanna to Vineet Bhatia  they seemed sad and even  shattered. But I thought the best tribute came from the New York Times’ Pete Wells. Of Floyd  he wrote “He told us stories about the thrills and the comforts of India… He told us that sharing your enthusiasm could be a form of generosity. From most points of view it doesn’t make a lot of sense for a restaurant to serve about a dozen egg dishes  unless it is a diner. It makes even less sense for the same restaurant to offer single-malt Scotch of every known region  shade  aroma  flavour  style and age. Mr. Cardoz was wild about eggs though and crazy for Scotch  so he bet heavily on both.” I liked Wells’ piece because I thought it captured Floyd’s essential philosophy. Food was about joy and about passion. Wells singled out Eggs Kejriwal  the dish that the Bombay Canteen made famous  as an example of Floyd’s style: simple  low cost  regional  seasonal ingredients cooked with flair  fun and passion. Technically  Floyd was an exceptional French chef. He had risen to the top at Lespinasse  in its time  New York’s best French restaurant  so he knew his fancy ingredients  his classic techniques and his sauces. But he didn’t care only about fancy food. People still rave about Tabla  the modern Indian restaurant he ran in New York for 14 years. But they forget that he also ran the cheaper Bread Bar in the same building  serving simpler Indian food. They forget too that such staples of Indian restaurant cuisine as the Bacon Kulcha were created at Tabla in 1998. Judging by the number of great global chefs and critics who have written to say how much they admired him. Floyd could have made a very successful career out of cooking European or American food in the West. But the commitment to Indian food came from deep within his soul. In 2019 when I wrote that Indian chefs did not get the global recognition they deserved  he wrote to me: “Love your insights on 50 Best. It drives me crazy that our chefs are not recognised. Thank you for putting it out there. Many Indians still like to kowtow to anything that is not Indian. I have so much to say about it….” He didn’t get to say all of it  alas. Such are Brunch’s deadlines that though I interviewed the Bombay Canteen team on 7 March  the article did not appear till last Sunday more than two weeks later. In that fortnight it seemed as though the world had changed. Floyd had gone back to America  had gone to hospital  had been diagnosed with Coronavirus and by the time the article appeared  all restaurants had been shut. Within three days of the publication of the article  he was dead. There are many reasons to admire Floyd. But these are the ones I will remember. He was respected around the world but in his heart  he was an Indian who cared passionately about our cuisine. He thought that food without fun or joy  made solely to impress foreign critics (and God knows  Floyd had impressed them all in his time) was fake and phoney. He believed in Indian flavours recreated without artifice. Long before “farm to table” became a pretentious mantra  Floyd was talking about ‘the treasures of the land and the sea” and using fresh  seasonal ingredients. He loved his chefs and mentored them. Two of the best chefs in Mumbai: Thomas Zacharias and Hussain Shahzad (of O Pedro) were Floyd protégés. He was humble and unwilling to push himself forward. I was at an event where Mauro Colagreco (three Michelin stars  owner of Mirazur  the best restaurant in the world according to the 50 Best List) saw Floyd and called out to him. Floyd obviously knew Mauro but he was much keener to get Hussain to meet him than to talk to Mauro himself. Each time I think of Floyd  my final image is of him waving goodbye as I drove away from the Bombay Sweet Shop. Who would have imagined how things would change so soon? The restaurant community has lost a legend. And the world has lost a very good human being.

Rajender also asked the medical infrastructure development corporation to acquire as many equipment as possible  including ICU facilities and ventilators  at the earliest to brace for the situation in the event of the disease enters the third phase. Meanwhile  the situation turned tense at the Telangana-Andhra borders  where hundreds of students and employees evicted from hostels in Hyderabad  found themselves following a categorical announcement by Andhra chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy that it was not possible to allow the stranded travellers to enter the state. “It is very painful to see so many people being held up at borders and I am not in a position to welcome my own state’s people. But I am helpless in allowing them into the state because of the grave situation prevailing on account of Coronavirus ” he said  and appealed to the people to stay wherever they were. At Vadapalli check-post on Telangana-Andhra border on Nalgonda-Guntur state highway  scores of people who had been waiting to get into AP border since Wednesday night  turned violent and pelted stones at the police  injuring at least five constables. The police resorted to lathi charge to disperse the protestors. The AP government told them that they would be allowed into the state only if they agree to be quarantined for 14-days.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-dedicates-hospital-for-covid-19-patients-as-infections-rise-to-45/story-uxE9CirZGd8dtRimvLEBRL.html

An excerpt from the book reads  “In around 2020  a severe pneumonia like illness will spread throughout the globe  attacking the lungs and bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived  attack again ten years later  and then disappear completely.” Kourtney just sent this on our group chat pic.twitter.com/XyjGajY71d A 2017 Asterix comic  Asterix and the Chariot Race  featured a ruthless Roman villain by the name of Coronavirus.

The virus was manipulated to attack the lungs directly within just five minutes of being exposed.” The show also mentions that no cure exists for the virus  and that the only way to combat it is to wash one’s hands.

A time to rest  and recoup.. in fact I wish I would learn to take breaks like this without it being enforced in this unfortunate way. It also got me thinking .. Last year a lot of what I read in the news was about Brexit  US China trade war  Harry and Meghan leaving the royal family  and then experiencing the protests in Hong Kong . But  all of that seems much less talked about in the face of a global health crisis. Without good health it seems there is little place for any other perspective.

21/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Fit and fine: Keeping fit amidst the Corona virus scare,With most gyms and other fitness centres being closed  here’s how you can still keep yourself fit within the confines of your home,We are in the midst of a pandemic scare and the health authorities have advised staying away from crowds. Since gyms are on the top of the list of places to be ordered shut  your pursuit of fitness can take a hit. It is very easy to give in to being slothful and just plonk yourself in front of a television  binge watching mindless movies and inane serials. But you can still get fit and strong at home  it just needs a little bit of creativity and a willingness to think out of the box! Fitness at home The usual go to exercises are push ups  body weight squats  lunges etc. But we want to shake up things a little and not do the regular “ole” circuits of push ups  lunges  rinse and repeat. See what I did here! Most people think that you cannot get strong unless you use external load because the number one principle for getting strong is Progressive Overload. Most people think that the only way to get strong on bodyweight exercises is to do very high number of repetitions. But you can also increase strength and add muscle size by doing single limb aka unilateral body weight exercises. Enter the one arm push up and single leg squat aka the pistol Most fitness enthusiasts who can bench press and squat quite a bit of weight will have problems while trying to do a one arm push up and the Pistol Squat.  Being able to balance on one leg for the Pistol Squat and on three points for the one arm push up  makes these exercises unique in terms of muscle activation and overload. Not only do they have a direct impact on what are known as the prime movers – chest  shoulders  triceps for the push ups and thighs  glutes for the squats – also the stabilisers  smaller muscles which do not adequately overloaded in bilateral exercises. Strengthening the smaller muscles will help in improving overall strength and injury proofing a trainee. It’s a win win all the way. Regressions and progressions One arm push up •Start with what is known as an archer push up – one arm under the shoulder and the other arm straight out to the side  perpendicular to the torso. Get to 15-20 reps with this version. •From the archer push up go to the straight arm placed higher on a rolled up towel/small ball. Touch the towel/ball lightly. Get to 15-20 reps with this version.  •Now put the hand on the hip and do assisted one arm push ups. This is pretty close to a legit one arm push up. Stay with this version for a while. For some people  they do no need to go beyond this version. •The final version – the free hand does not touch any part of the body. Congratulations you have achieved a real One Arm Push up.  Single leg squat or the pistol  •Reduce the range by squatting to a high chair or a bed. Work up to at least 20 reps per leg. Once you can hit 20 reps  squat slightly lower. Continue like this.  •Another way is to start by squatting down with both legs and coming up on a single leg or squat down on a single leg and come up on both legs. Work up to at least 20 reps per leg. •Now you are ready to attempt a Pistol! Not having access to a gym should not interrupt your fitness journey. In fact  use this time to work on getting stronger on body weight exercises  especially the ones I list above and reap innumerable benefits! Now go do it.

19/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Coronavirus in India: Ready to help India with epidemic prevention experience  says China,Coronavirus update: The Chinese foreign ministry said it could help with both the “control” and “diagnosis” of the spread of the disease in India.,China on Thursday said it was ready to share its experience of “epidemic prevention” with New Delhi as the coronavirus pandemic looks to grip India and it announces aggressive containment measures against it. The Chinese foreign ministry said it could help with both the “control” and “diagnosis” of the spread of the disease in India. Saying it “admires and appreciates” the support from the Indian society in its fight against the novel coronavirus or Covid-19 crisis  the ministry added that China guarantees the “health and safety” of Indian citizens in China. Beijing made the overture to New Delhi on a day when China reported zero domestic transmissions for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak started  emerging from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and then blowing up into a pandemic within several weeks. It was a change of tact from Beijing  which less than a month before had seemingly delayed the third Indian relief-evacuation flight to and from the outbreak epicentre Wuhan following New Delhi’s decision to ban the export of protective clothing to all countries including China in January. “China is ready to continue to share its experience in epidemic prevention and control and diagnosis and treatment with the Indian side  and will provide further support and assistance within its capacity according to the needs of the Indian side ” the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement. “China and India  the only two major countries with more than 1 billion people  face common challenges in public health ” the statement said. At the peak of the outbreak in February  China was reporting thousands of new cases of infection and hundreds of deaths in a day. That number has dramatically fallen  the Chinese government says because of the stringent measures it took to contain the disease in Hubei while it is spreading like wildfire globally. “At present  the new outbreak of pneumonia in many parts of the world  the epidemic prevention situation is grim”. The foreign ministry said the Chinese embassy in New Delhi was in contact with health authorities in India to keep New Delhi informed about the evolving coronavirus outbreak situation in China. “The Chinese embassy in India has established a contact mechanism with the Indian health authorities to keep the Indian side informed of the situation and progress in a timely manner ” the statement said. India was one of the first countries to issue travel advisories and put in place a surveillance system at airports for travellers coming in from China in January. “Since the outbreak of the new pneumonia  China and India have actively conducted communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention and control ” the statement said. It added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent a letter of condolence to President Xi Jinping on the crisis  and foreign minister S Jaishankar had a telephone conversation with state councilor and foreign minister  Wang Yi on it. “The Indian side has also provided medical supplies to China. We admire and appreciate the support from all sectors of the Indian society for China’s anti-epidemic efforts in various ways ” the foreign ministry said. The Indian government had sent 15 tons of medical supplies to China on an Indian Air Force flight that also took back about a 100 Indians from Wuhan and Hubei on its way back in the last week of February. The Indian medical assistance to China comprised “…masks  gloves and other emergency medical equipment”. “This assistance has been provided in the wake the Corona virus (Covid 19) outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment ” an Indian government statement had then said. Earlier in February  New Delhi evacuated more than 300 Indians in two special Air India flights from Wuhan.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-india-ready-to-help-india-with-epidemic-prevention-experience-says-china/story-Gnmoz731NQc9zxHaLAmqeI.html
19/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,germany;india;italy,Punjab CM Amarinder Singh asks Centre to allow coronavirus tests by private hospitals,,Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday warned of a worsening coronavirus crisis in the country and urging the Centre to allow private hospitals to conduct tests for the virus affliction to ensure its access to all the people. Calling for a national level fight against the pandemic on a war footing  Singh said he will take up the issue of testing by private hospitals and labs with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday during the latter’s proposed video conference with all chief ministers.  The chief minister also suggested to the Centre to distribute its over 20 million food stocks  stored in Punjab godowns  among the poor whose earnings have been hit due to coronavirus outbreak.  With the number of coronavirus cases increasing  the Centre has to consider reviewing its policy  stressed the CM  making it clear that he did not agree with the current policy of the government of India in this regard. Given the fact that Punjab has private labs in all its major cities  it is not logical for a suspected coronavirus patient to have to travel to Chandigarh or some other distant place to get himself tested from a government facility only  said Singh  adding that only in case of doubt should such a person be required to go elsewhere for a second test.   Singh was speaking at a conclave to mark the third anniversary of his government  according to a government release here. Insisting that he is not a pessimist  he said the way things are going around the world  it is obvious that India has to be prepared for the worst. The coronavirus has just entered India and the problem is likely to escalate in line with the its rising graph in other countries  he said  adding  “We have to be prepared in every way.”  The suggestion came even as Punjab reported the death of a 70-year-old man who had arrived from Germany via Italy on March 7  and had proceeded to the state the same day.   He was a known case of diabetes and hypertension  and was confirmed as a coronavirus positive case on Wednesday  said the release. The CM also suggested that the Centre should allow the food stocks currently stored in Punjab godowns to be distributed to the poor whose earnings have been impacted due to the coronavirus outbreak instead of letting them rot in the storage areas.   Since the stocks belonged to the Government of India  it was in their purview to take a decision in this regard  he said  adding that the 20 million tonnes of food grains that Food Corporation of India (FCI) yet to be lifted from godowns could be put to better use by feeding the people not just in Punjab but wherever needed.   Such a move would be a life saver for the people of India in the current crisis  he added. On the issue of congregations at gurdwaras and other religious places  the CM said he has already requested religious heads to limit gatherings to under 50 and to appeal to the devotees from their podiums not to gather in large numbers.   He was hopeful that the religious heads would support the move  said Singh  adding that the government was not harassing people but was trying to save lives. With respect to the problem of pollution  which is found to aggravate the coronavirus disease  the CM said his government was doing its best to manage stubble burning but the Centre has to step in with the requisite support.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-asks-centre-to-allow-coronavirus-tests-by-private-hospitals/story-uMesdnMhtxzSjExYBBdeNO.html

19/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,PM Modi address to the nation on Coronavirus: Read full speech text here,In a nearly 30-minute national broadcast  the prime minister asked people to stay indoors and work from home as much as possible while underscoring the dangers of coronavirus  saying the world has never seen a crisis as grave as this.,Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday calling for “resolve and restraint” to fight coronavirus and asked the entire country to observe ‘Janta curfew’ on Sunday  March 22. The curfew  PM Modi said  will observed from 7 am to 9 pm.  In a nearly 30-minute national broadcast  the prime minister asked people to stay indoors and work from home as much as possible while underscoring the dangers of coronavirus  saying the world has never seen a crisis as grave as this. Read the full speech text here.  My dear fellow citizens   The whole world is currently passing through a period of very serious crisis. Normally  when a natural crisis strikes  it is limited to a few countries or states. However  this time the calamityis such that it has it has put all of mankind in crisis. World Wars 1 and 2 did not impact as many countries  as have been affected by Corona today. Over the last two months  we are continuouslyobserving and hearing of grave Corona virus related news.In these two months  the 130 crore citizens of India have ably dealt with the global Corona pandemic and have exercised due caution. However  in the past few days  it is appearing as if we have averted the crisis  and everything is okay. Complacency in respect of a global pandemic like Corona is not appropriate. Therefore  it is essential that each and every Indian remains alert and cautious. Friends  Whenever I asked you for something  you have never let me down. Our efforts succeed  only on the strength of your blessings. Today  I am here to ask you  all my fellow citizens  for something.I want your coming few weeks from you  your time in the near future. Friends  Till now  science has not been able to find a definite solution to save us from the Corona pandemic neither has a vaccine been developed.In such a situation  it is very natural to get worried. Study of the countries most affected by Coronavirus has revealed another aspect.In these countries  the spread of the disease has witnessed almost an explosion after the initial few days. The number of people infected by Corona has grown at a rapid pace. Government of India is constantly keeping a close watch on this situation  and this track record of the spread of Corona. Although there are a few countries which have controlled the situation by taking swift decisions and isolating its people as much as possible. This burgeoning crisis of Corona  is not an ordinary occurrence for a nation like India with a population of 130 crore  striving for development. Therefore  as we witnessthe wide-spread impact of the Corona pandemic even in major  developed countries today  it is wrong to assume that India will not be impacted by it. Hence  it is imperative to keep two key factors in mind in order to combat this global pandemic - Determination and Patience. Today  all 130 crorefellow citizens of Indians will have to further strengthen our resolve to overcome this global crisis  fulfilling all our duties as citizens  and abiding by the directions given by the Central and State governments.Today  we must all resolve to not get infected ourselves  and prevent others as well from getting infected. Friends  During such a pandemic  only one mantra can take us through –‘Hum Swasth  toh Jag Swasth’  that isthe world will be healthy  if we stay healthy.In a situation like this  where there is no known cure for the disease  it is imperative that we stay healthy.Patience is an essential virtue to avoid this disease  and keep oneself healthy. And how does one practice patience? By staying away from crowds and gatherings  avoiding leaving your homes. This is called ‘Social Distancing’ nowadays  and is critical in these times of the globalcorona pandemic. Our determination and patience will play a crucial role in containing the impact of this global pandemic. It is wrong if you believe that you are okay and nothing can happen to you  and you can continue roaming around in markets andstreets as usual and remain unaffected. By doing this  you will not only be unjust to yourself but also to your family. Keeping this is mind  I appeal to you all that for the next few weeks  step-out of your homes only when absolutely necessary.As far as possible  try and do your work  whether related to business or job  from home. While it is essential that those who are in government services  healthcare services  people’s representatives  media personnel remain active. Everybody else must however  isolate themselves from the rest of society. I also appeal thatthe elderly  senior citizens and those above 65 years of age in our families  not leave homes for the next few weeks. Today’s generation may not be very familiar with this but in the olden times  blackout was observed at night during wartime. This would at times go on for prolonged periods. Several times  there would also be blackout drills. Friends  Today  I request my fellow citizens for support on one more issue  that of people’s curfew. People’scurfew means a curfew imposed for the people  by the people  on the people themselves. This Sunday  that is on 22nd March  all citizen must abide by this people’s curfew from 7 AM until 9 PM. During this curfew  we shall neither leave our homes  nor get onto the streets or roam about our localities.Only those associated with emergency and essential services will leave their homes. Friends  22nd March will be a symbol of our effort  of our self-restraint and our resolve to fulfil our duty in service of the nation.The success of a people’s curfew on 22nd March  and the experience gained from it  will also prepare us for our upcoming challenges. I urge all state governments to take leadership in ensuring compliance of this people’s curfew. I also requestthe youth of our nation  organizations like NCC  NSS  civil society  as well asother organizations of all types to spread awareness about this people’s curfew over the next 2 days. I would appeal to every individual to if possible  call at least 10 people on the phone everyday  explaining to them how to protect themselves from the virus as well as the idea of people’s curfew. This people’s curfew will in a way be a litmus test for us  for our nation. This is also the time to see and test how prepared India is for fighting off a Corona like global pandemic. Friends  In the midst of all these efforts of the people’s curfew on 22nd March  I would also like to seek your support on one more matter on that day. For the past 2 months  lakhs of our people have been working day and night in our Hospitals and Airports. From doctors to nurses  hospital staff  sanitation workers  airlines employees  government staff  police personnel  media people  people associated with train-bus-auto rickshaw services  and home delivery agents; all have been selflessly serving others  without caring about themselves. In the current circumstances  these services cannot be considered to be ordinary. Today  these people run the risk of getting infected themselves. Yet  they continue to fulfil their duties  serving others. As defenders of the nation  they stand firmly between us and the Corona pandemic. The nation is grateful to them all. I wish that on Sunday  22nd March  we express our gratitude to all such people.On Sunday at exactly 5 pm  we all stand at the doors  balconies  windows of our homes  and give them all a 5-minute standing ovation.We clap our hands  beat our plates  ring our bells to boost their morale  salute their service. To inform people about this  I request local authorities across the country to ring a siren at 5 pm on 22nd March. We must with full sincerity  express our feelings towards all such fellow citizens who have lived by our value-system of ‘Seva Parmo Dharma’  that is Service being the highest Duty. Friends  In such times of crisis  we also need to be aware that the burden on our essential services  our hospitals  is continuously increasing. I thus  urge you to as much as possible  avoid going to the hospital for routine check-ups.When necessary  you could get the required guidance over phone from your known local doctor  family doctor  or some relative who is a doctor.In case you have a non-essential  elective surgery scheduled  I would urge you to postpone it by a month. Friends  This global pandemic is also going to have a wide-ranging impact on the economy.Keeping in mind the economic challenges arising from the Corona virus  the government has decided to set up a COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force under the leadership of the Finance Minister. This Task Force will take decisions in the near future  based on regular interactions and feedback from all stakeholders  and analysis of all situations and dimensions. This Task Force will also ensure that all steps taken to reduce the economic difficulties are effectively implemented. It is clear that this pandemic is deeply hurting the economic interests and well-being of our nation’s middle class  lower-middle class  and poor segments.In such a time of crisis  I request the business world and high income segments of society to as much as possible  look after the economic interests of all the people who provide them services. In the coming few days it is possible these people may not be able to come to office or your homes. In such a case  do treat them with empathy and humanity and not deduct their salaries. Always keep in mind that they too need to run their homes  protect their families from illness. I would like to reassure all Indians that all steps necessary are being taken to ensure there is no shortage of essential items like milk  groceries and medicines. I thus urge all my fellow citizens to make purchases as normal  and not hoard essential items in Panic Buying. Friends  Over the past 2 months  130 crore Indians  each and every citizen  has taken on this national crisis as one’s own and done whatever possible for society and the nation.I have full faith that you will in a similar manner  continue to carry out your responsibilities and duties in the time to come. Yes  I acknowledge that many difficulties arise in such times  and there is an environment of apprehensions and rumours.Many a times  our expectations as citizens is also not fulfilled. However  this crisis is so grave  that all fellow citizens must face these challenges with firm resolve and determination  amidst all these difficulties. Friends  We need to put in all our capacity and capability in protecting ourselves from the Corona virus.Whether it be the Central government  State governments  local authorities  panchayats  people’s representatives or civil societies; everyone is contributing in their own way in the fight against this global pandemic. You too  must give your full contribution! It is critical that in this environment of a global pandemic  humanity emerges victorious  India emerges victorious! The festival of Navratri is coming up in a few days. This is a festival of worshipping ‘Shakti’. That India moves ahead with full Shakti  full Strength and Energy  is my heartfelt wish to one and all. Many  many Thanks!,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speech-on-coronavirus-read-full-speech-text-here/story-Ipkr5lg5C2ib8iGs6GVFSL.html

19/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Coronavirus in India: Ready to help India with epidemic prevention experience  says China,Coronavirus update: The Chinese foreign ministry said it could help with both the “control” and “diagnosis” of the spread of the disease in India.,China on Thursday said it was ready to share its experience of “epidemic prevention” with New Delhi as the coronavirus pandemic looks to grip India and it announces aggressive containment measures against it. The Chinese foreign ministry said it could help with both the “control” and “diagnosis” of the spread of the disease in India. Saying it “admires and appreciates” the support from the Indian society in its fight against the novel coronavirus or Covid-19 crisis  the ministry added that China guarantees the “health and safety” of Indian citizens in China. Beijing made the overture to New Delhi on a day when China reported zero domestic transmissions for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak started  emerging from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and then blowing up into a pandemic within several weeks. It was a change of tact from Beijing  which less than a month before had seemingly delayed the third Indian relief-evacuation flight to and from the outbreak epicentre Wuhan following New Delhi’s decision to ban the export of protective clothing to all countries including China in January. “China is ready to continue to share its experience in epidemic prevention and control and diagnosis and treatment with the Indian side  and will provide further support and assistance within its capacity according to the needs of the Indian side ” the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement. “China and India  the only two major countries with more than 1 billion people  face common challenges in public health ” the statement said. At the peak of the outbreak in February  China was reporting thousands of new cases of infection and hundreds of deaths in a day. That number has dramatically fallen  the Chinese government says because of the stringent measures it took to contain the disease in Hubei while it is spreading like wildfire globally. “At present  the new outbreak of pneumonia in many parts of the world  the epidemic prevention situation is grim”. The foreign ministry said the Chinese embassy in New Delhi was in contact with health authorities in India to keep New Delhi informed about the evolving coronavirus outbreak situation in China. “The Chinese embassy in India has established a contact mechanism with the Indian health authorities to keep the Indian side informed of the situation and progress in a timely manner ” the statement said. India was one of the first countries to issue travel advisories and put in place a surveillance system at airports for travellers coming in from China in January. “Since the outbreak of the new pneumonia  China and India have actively conducted communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention and control ” the statement said. It added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent a letter of condolence to President Xi Jinping on the crisis  and foreign minister S Jaishankar had a telephone conversation with state councilor and foreign minister  Wang Yi on it. “The Indian side has also provided medical supplies to China. We admire and appreciate the support from all sectors of the Indian society for China’s anti-epidemic efforts in various ways ” the foreign ministry said. The Indian government had sent 15 tons of medical supplies to China on an Indian Air Force flight that also took back about a 100 Indians from Wuhan and Hubei on its way back in the last week of February. The Indian medical assistance to China comprised “…masks  gloves and other emergency medical equipment”. “This assistance has been provided in the wake the Corona virus (Covid 19) outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment ” an Indian government statement had then said. Earlier in February  New Delhi evacuated more than 300 Indians in two special Air India flights from Wuhan.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-india-ready-to-help-india-with-epidemic-prevention-experience-says-china/story-Gnmoz731NQc9zxHaLAmqeI.html
19/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,germany;india;italy,Punjab CM Amarinder Singh asks Centre to allow coronavirus tests by private hospitals,,Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday warned of a worsening coronavirus crisis in the country and urging the Centre to allow private hospitals to conduct tests for the virus affliction to ensure its access to all the people. Calling for a national level fight against the pandemic on a war footing  Singh said he will take up the issue of testing by private hospitals and labs with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday during the latter’s proposed video conference with all chief ministers.  The chief minister also suggested to the Centre to distribute its over 20 million food stocks  stored in Punjab godowns  among the poor whose earnings have been hit due to coronavirus outbreak.  With the number of coronavirus cases increasing  the Centre has to consider reviewing its policy  stressed the CM  making it clear that he did not agree with the current policy of the government of India in this regard. Given the fact that Punjab has private labs in all its major cities  it is not logical for a suspected coronavirus patient to have to travel to Chandigarh or some other distant place to get himself tested from a government facility only  said Singh  adding that only in case of doubt should such a person be required to go elsewhere for a second test.   Singh was speaking at a conclave to mark the third anniversary of his government  according to a government release here. Insisting that he is not a pessimist  he said the way things are going around the world  it is obvious that India has to be prepared for the worst. The coronavirus has just entered India and the problem is likely to escalate in line with the its rising graph in other countries  he said  adding  “We have to be prepared in every way.”  The suggestion came even as Punjab reported the death of a 70-year-old man who had arrived from Germany via Italy on March 7  and had proceeded to the state the same day.   He was a known case of diabetes and hypertension  and was confirmed as a coronavirus positive case on Wednesday  said the release. The CM also suggested that the Centre should allow the food stocks currently stored in Punjab godowns to be distributed to the poor whose earnings have been impacted due to the coronavirus outbreak instead of letting them rot in the storage areas.   Since the stocks belonged to the Government of India  it was in their purview to take a decision in this regard  he said  adding that the 20 million tonnes of food grains that Food Corporation of India (FCI) yet to be lifted from godowns could be put to better use by feeding the people not just in Punjab but wherever needed.   Such a move would be a life saver for the people of India in the current crisis  he added. On the issue of congregations at gurdwaras and other religious places  the CM said he has already requested religious heads to limit gatherings to under 50 and to appeal to the devotees from their podiums not to gather in large numbers.   He was hopeful that the religious heads would support the move  said Singh  adding that the government was not harassing people but was trying to save lives. With respect to the problem of pollution  which is found to aggravate the coronavirus disease  the CM said his government was doing its best to manage stubble burning but the Centre has to step in with the requisite support.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-asks-centre-to-allow-coronavirus-tests-by-private-hospitals/story-uMesdnMhtxzSjExYBBdeNO.html

In India more than 150 people have been infected and three have died. Governments over the world are scrambling to rescue airlines that have been forced to park planes and cut jobs as the virus puts the brakes on travel. Airlines may need a bailout of more than $200 billion  the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates. The Trump administration  earlier on Wednesday  sought approval from Congress for $50 billion in secured loans to U.S. airlines to address the financial impact during the crisis.  Vistara  a joint venture of Singapore Airlines  and India’s Tata Group  and budget carrier GoAir have suspended their international operations. IndiGo   India’s biggest carrier  has cancelled several overseas flights and may be forced to park some planes as domestic air travel also falls. Global aviation consultancy CAPA’s India unit said that regardless of any fiscal concessions and support the government may offer  most airlines will have to shrink their operations and the more vulnerable carriers may shutdown. CAPA estimates that Indian airlines  excluding state carrier Air India  will report losses of up to $600 million for the January-March quarter  which could worsen if demand continues to fall.  “In the absence of serious and meaningful government intervention  such an outcome could lead to several Indian airlines shutting down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash ” CAPA said in its March 18 report.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/india-mulls-1-6-billion-rescue-plan-for-airlines-hit-by-covid-19-report/story-abpvFg5JHUbKiYB1gV7VgK.html

The Congress leader added that the country was likely to pay a “heavy price” for the government’s alleged “inability to act decisively”. “India is going to pay an extremely heavy price for our governments (sic) inability to act decisively ” his tweet added. Rahul’s warning cum prophecy comes at a time when Indian markets along with their global counterparts are witnessing record losses due to the impact of coronavirus. The tourism sector is among the worst hit and the cascading impact of the slowdown in economic activities due to restrictions  both domestic and global in the wake of the disease  is likely to manifest itself in the coming days. A couple of rating agencies have already slashed India’s growth forecast for 2020-2021 to just above 5% Rahul has been consistently warning that the government’s preparedness to deal with the deadly contagion is not enough and has prophesised that the economy will be the worst-affected. He compared the outbreak to a “Tsunami” only yesterday while speaking to reporters. “The Indian economy is going to be devastated. You have no idea the painful thing the country has suffered and it is coming. It is like a tsunami is coming ” Rahul said. Also Read-‘A tsunami is coming’: Rahul Gandhi warns Centre over coronavirus  economy India has seen three deaths due to Covid 19 so far with a total of 147 confirmed infections including 25 foreign nationals and 14 cured individuals. Rahul Gandhi had first posted his concerns over India’s response to the contagion that started in neighbouring China infecting over 82 000 residents on February 12 and alleged that the government was “not taking it seriously” when timely action was “critical”. “The Corona Virus is an extremely serious threat to our people and our economy. My sense is the government is not taking this threat seriously ” his tweet said when the infection was still in its infancy in India. On March 5  he had likened the government’s assurances of having things under control with assurances offered by “the Capt of the Titanic”—the famous British cruise liner that sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean on its first voyage on April 15  1912  with over 2200 passengers and crew on board. “Health Minister saying that the Indian Govt has the #coronavirus crisis under control  is like the Capt of the Titanic telling passengers not to panic as his ship was unsinkable. It’s time the Govt made public an action plan backed by solid resources to tackle this crisis. He tweeted again on March 13 to suggest the potential impact of the disease was being ignored by the administration. “The #coronavirus is a huge problem. Ignoring the problem is a non-solution. The Indian economy will be destroyed if strong action is not taken. The government is in a stupor ” he had said. The Central government along with those of the States  has taken several measures including suspension of visas  mandatory screening of passengers arriving from coronavirus hit countries  banning travel to and from to coronavirus hot spots  quarantining of suspects  shutting down schools  colleges and suspending events of mass gathering  tracking of suspects  and steps aimed to prevent community transmission of the disease  restrictions on entry and exit at land borders and on tourists to contain the spread of the disease.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-needs-aggressive-response-says-rahul-he-has-a-prophecy-too/story-0oaFC6Q2eqWZ2948WChOSP.html

18/03/2020,technology;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;singapore;chad,The Taste with Vir: Kindness in the time of Corona,The unorganised sector operates at many different levels but a large part of it consists of daily wage earners  of people who make a little money during the day and then feed their families with that money every evening. If they don’t make that money  then their families go hungry.,Almost every one of us will be affected by the current Corona virus crisis. Even those of us who avoid getting infected will see some reverses in our lives. The economy  already in recession  will go into free-fall over the next few months. Businesses will close. Jobs will be lost. Even those of us lucky enough to hold on to work may find our salaries reduced. In some sectors  the devastation will be widespread. Hotels are running at under 15% occupancy. Cinemas have been closed. Night clubs will be shut down. Restaurants are either running empty or are being forced to down their shutters by the authorities. The airline industry is battling for its survival. My heart goes out to all to those employed in these businesses and sectors - and frankly  to nearly everybody else too  because this crisis will have some impact on every industry - but there is one sector that I feel particularly bad about: the so-called unorganised sector. Most of India’s workforce is in the unorganised sector. The plumber and carpenter who come to your house to fix things are part of the unorganised sector. So is the guy who sells balloons at traffic lights. And so are most farmers. The unorganised sector operates at many different levels but a large part of it consists of daily wage earners  of people who make a little money during the day and then feed their families with that money every evening. If they don’t make that money  then their families go hungry. As bad as I feel about the hotels that are making losses  the airlines that face closure and everybody who loses a job  it is the daily wage earners I feel the worst about. If a rickshaw driver makes no money  then he can probably hold on for a week or so. But after that  his children starve. My particular area of interest among daily wage earners has always been the street food sector. Partly this is because I think that the best food in India is on the streets. But mostly it is because I feel that we don’t do enough to value our street food hawkers. In such places as Singapore  they get Michelin stars and are offered facilities by the government. In Bangkok  the Tourism Authority publicises them as one of the city’s main attractions. In the West  the food truck phenomenon has its roots in the street food tradition. Many famous American dishes started out as street foods: chilli con carne  hot dogs  hamburgers etc. But in India  governments treat street food vendors as the lowest form of human life. They are shaken down by municipal officials  terrorised by local mafias and robbed blind by corrupt policemen. Most of them barely eke out a living. For something like a decade now I have helped the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) in any way I can to try and make life easier for vendors. NASVI and the tireless Sangeeta Singh have worked hard to protect and promote street food vendors. Each year  it organises a street food festival in Delhi which draws vendors from all over India. Last year  along with Culinary Culture  we became part of the festival (though the FSSAI was the primary sponsor) and continued our year-long search for the best street food vendors in India. I had travelled extensively trying the top street food places in India but for the final awards  we got a panel of great chefs (Manish Mehrotra  Ritu Dalmia and Vikramjeet Roy) to visit the stalls and judge the vendors. The chefs were thrilled (Manish sent his whole Kitchen team to try the food the next day) and the vendors were excited. On the last day of the festival  we gave out awards to the best street food guys. Now  I am no stranger to food award functions. Not all of them are rigged affairs where you are charged for your awards. But many are. And generally  the audience is composed of the same faces who buy the same awards each year. So  it was humbling and enriching to give awards to the street food superstars  most of whom had received no recognition in their lives  let alone an award. Many wept openly on stage. Some touched Sangeeta’s feet in gratitude. And I was so moved that my eyes misted over. We will do the awards again this year. And we are working out if we can give cash awards - the money will make a huge difference to their lives. Given this background  you will understand why  during this crisis  my heart goes out to India’s street food vendors. Along with other daily wage earners  they face ruin and their families will starve if the crisis persists and people stop eating street food out of some paranoia that the Corona virus and chaat are united. (They are not. It is always good to be careful about hygiene when eating out but the virus has no special affection for tikki channa or other chaat dishes). My endeavour has been to try and help chaat wallahs during this crisis whenever I can. If I see a vendor without customers  I order two plates of what he is selling. I am greedy so I always eat the first plate. After that I look for a needy or hungry person who I can give the second plate to. If no one is around  I tell the vendor not to bother to make the second plate but to keep the money anyway. On Tuesday  I thought I would encourage others on Twitter to do the same. I tweeted: “I feel bad for everyone in the food business during this crisis. But worst hit are poor street food vendors whose families go hungry when business collapses.  Do what I do. When you see a vendor  buy two plates of what he is making. You don’t have to eat it. But help him make a living.” The response was heartening. The tweet had over 1000 likes in one hour. In 24 hours it had 7500 likes. Many people responded to say that they supported the initiative. Many people with large Twitter followings (Richa Chaddha  Suniel Shetty. Chitrangada Singh  etc) retweeted my tweet. I was proud of the compassion we had demonstrated as a society. Then  after three hours  a strange thing happened. A string of tweets from anonymous no bio/no DP /under-five follower accounts hit my timeline. Some said that street vendors were actually very well off and deserved nothing. One guy said that he worked in an IT company. (An IT cell  perhaps?) He earned less than these rich street food vendors. So who gave a damn about them? Others posted photos of dirty spaces and said that these were taken at street food places. A second wave attacked me for promoting waste. Why had I said to throw away the food? I had said no such thing. But the attacks kept coming. I looked up the bios. Most were obvious bots which suggested that some troll factory had organised a campaign against street food vendors. Some others (from people with bios) were from guys who described themselves using such phrases as “true Hindu” or “hate sickulars”. I tweeted back to one or two of them that their leader was (rightly) proud of being a chaiwallah. Did they not see the nobility in supplying food and drink to citizens  no matter how humble the level of the transaction? No response. I had so many thousands of likes that I don’t suppose the bots and trolls (under 100; probably less) should matter. But I remain intrigued. Why should Right Wing troll farms attack poor street vendors in such abusive and untruthful terms? Surely supporters of the PM should be sympathetic to the poor vendors? I have no answer. I gave up trying to figure out the motives of trolls and those who run bot-factories a long time ago. But it does reflect a current Indian reality. The majority of us are compassionate and decent. But there is a vocal minority that specialises in lies and mindless hatred.. And it is not a random thing. This is organised hatred. Twitter is an isolated  toxic  manipulated environment of its own. The real world is not necessarily like that. And it is in the real world that most of us have stood up for those less fortunate. In the difficult weeks ahead it is that goodwill and compassion that will keep India united.

As the gala stands postponed now  one’s keen to know how it would affect the future of fashion?,Every year  we would stay glued to social media waiting for the red carpet images from the Met Gala to pour in. The Met Ball is a significant style extravaganza which sets key red carpet trends  which impact the global fashion industry. However  this year in the wake of the Corona Virus pandemic  a chairman of the Gala since 1995  Anna Wintour postponed the event after much contemplation. The first gala was held in 1948 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art  New York  to encourage donations from New York’s high society. The theme of the Met’s Costume Exhibition changes every year. While the last year’s theme - ‘Camp: Notes on Fashion’ was all about toasting exaggerated stylistic interpretations   this year’s theme  ‘About Time: Fashion and Duration’ is partly inspired by Virginia Woolf and the theories of the French philosopher Henri Bergson.

The stock exchanges all over the world have crashed and will further go downhill. The supply chain of the fashion industry will be massively affected... from procurement of fabric  to manufacture  transportation  your lead times  everything.

A senior Home Ministry official said the move is aimed at minimising the chances of viral transmission by restricting person-to-person contacts. “We have decided to suspend the use of breath-analyser apparatus for the time being ” he said. It is in fact a very useful equipment to maintain the neutrality and objectivity of police officials who use this apparatus during checking  the official added.

A circular in this regard was issued by Vinay Kargaonkar  Additional Director General of Police (ADGP)  Maharashtra Highway Police  on Monday. “Outbreak of coronavirus has been reported in the state.

16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Delhi living in the shadow of coronavirus,Delhiites adjust to a new life as fear of Covid-19 grows by the day  businesses temporarily shut shops  people socially distance themselves and go looking for books dealing with prophesies  conspiracy theories surrounding the pandemic.,It is late afternoon and a train heading to Dwarka has just arrived at the Noida City Centre Metro Station. Inside the half-empty compartment  Rohit Khanna has his headphones plugged in and seems oblivious to everything else. Suddenly  a middle-aged man sitting next to him sneezes. A visibly irritated Khanna picks up his bag and moves to stand next to the train doors  his eyes suspiciously scanning his fellow travellers  most of whom  like him  are wearing masks. “I am really worried while travelling on this route. A couple of days back  over 700 employees of a firm in Noida were quarantined after one of their senior executives was tested positive for the coronavirus. I assume that many of these employees would have travelled in these trains. What we are faced with is an invisible and unpredictable enemy  which is moving slowly and stealthily among us ” says Khanna. The ‘invisible enemy’  Covid-19  the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus  has spread from Wuhan  China to almost all corners of the world. On Friday  it claimed its first victim in the Capital  adding one more to the over 5 000 deaths globally. Delhi  which has been on the edge since the first case was reported earlier this month  began quarantining itself. Companies asked employees to work from home  educational institutes and cinema halls have shut  medical shops are running out of masks and hand sanitisers  while people stayed away from hotels and restaurants. “No  I do not fear Wuhan 2.0 in Delhi  but we need to be careful  and avoid the ‘it cannot happen to me syndrome’. These are not normal times in the city ” says Khanna as he exited the train at Rajiv Chowk Metro station  which had a thin crowd of commuters with most eateries having few customers  something rare during the peak hour of the day. In Khan Market  shoppers could be seen pulling out small bottles of hand sanitisers from their bags and rubbing a few drops onto their hands. Many idle shopkeepers sat at the counters of mostly empty shops  watching the news  or reading newspapers. “There were a lot of people in the market on Thursday. Our TV was on  and suddenly the news flashed that the Delhi government had declared Covid-19 an epidemic. It ordered all cinema halls in the city to shut  and the few customers we had left soon ” says Jatin Kanjoria  a cashier at the China Fare  a restaurant in Khan Market. “Half an hour after the news  I went out and saw that the crowd had thinned dramatically in the market. People feared the worst and rushed home  I guess.” On Friday evening  there was just one customer inside China Fare   his eyes glued to the news on TV. “Earlier  we used to play only music on TV  but now customers only want to watch the news ” says Kanjoria. The walls of the restaurant had a mural of a person seemingly feeding a dragon. Does being a Chinese food restaurant create a problem in the time of Coronavirus? Konjoria chooses not to answer  but says  “Everyone’s business has gone down dramatically in the market. The otherwise crammed parking lot has enough space for everyone these days.” A lot of shopkeepers in the market could be seen wearing masks. “It is because of the fear of foreign customers. No one knows which country they have come from. Khan Market attracts the maximum number of foreign shoppers in the city  and you never know who could be carrying the disease ” says a shopkeeper  who does not want to be named. After a pause  he adds  “If the wife of the Canadian Prime Minister can contract the disease  anyone can. It does not discriminate between class  colour  communities and countries. The virus has proved the world is indeed flat.” Uncertainty over who will be next  or what will be the route that the virus will take has spooked many residents. “Natural disasters  riots and horrific crimes do shock the city  but then it is over in a few days. In the case of the coronavirus  people do not know what they are up against  how long it will last and whether they too will fall victim ” says Mahendra Chauhan  a Vasant Kunj resident who comes to the market to shop for books. Abhinav Bhami  who runs Faqir Chand & Sons  a bookstore in Khan Market  has had customers in the past week demanding books he had never heard of from people he had never seen before. “See  these are two books people want at any cost these days ” he says  showing us the jackets of the books — ‘End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World’ by Sylvia Brown  and ‘The Eyes of Darkness’ by Dean Koontz — on his iPhone. The apparent reason for the growing demand for these books is that both seem to have made eerie prophecies on pandemic  which the Covid-19 is. “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe  attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived  attack again 10 years later  and then disappear completely ” reads a paragraph in Brown’s book. Similarly  Koontz  many believe  ‘predicted’ the coronavirus outbreak in 1981. His novel made reference to a virus called “Wuhan-400”. Thankfully  the similarities end there: in the novel  the virus was a biological weapon with a 100% “kill rate” — it would kill everyone it infected. In comparison  the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the mortality rate from Covid-19 at about 3.4%. It has also now emerged that the original name of the virus was “Gorki-400”  in reference to a Russian locality; its name was changed to “Wuhan-400” when the book was released again in 1989. Bhami tried his best to get his “new customers” the books they wanted  but failed. He has  however  ensured that he will have enough copies of “The Corona Virus  What you need to know about the Global Pandemic” that will be published by Penguin Random House India. The book promises ‘to demystify the outbreak and debunk myths’ that are causing frenzy everywhere. Physician Dr Swapneil Parikh  co-author of the book  says  “Either humanity changes its approach to pandemics or pandemics will devastatingly change humanity. The book will tackle conspiracy theories and talk about the economic  political and social fallout of the pandemic.” The Full Circle Bookshop has prominently displayed a recently released book  curiously titled “Virusphere: From Common Colds to Ebola Epidemics—Why We Need the Viruses That Plague Us” by Frank Ryan  a UK- based physician who has written several best-selling books on evolutionary virology. Bhami says that with schools closed  there has been a rise in the sale of children’s fiction. Ritu Gupta  who lives in South Extension  has just bought a bag full of books. “At this time of the year  we generally go out of the city for a few days. But this time we decided to stay at home  and it is hard keeping children busy. So far  they have spent time playing board games. Now  I have stocked up on books for a few months. We are not sure when schools will reopen ” says Gupta. “I believe reading is a good way of dealing with the pangs of compulsory social distancing. I must say that the government has responded with the urgency the pandemic required  even better than many western governments  including the US.” Satish Sundra  owner of Ram Chander & Sons  perhaps the country’s oldest toy store in Connaught Place  is a worried man. He feels that a lot of fear and panic that he is witnessing in Delhi is unprecedented—and unnecessary. “During the war in 1965 and 1971  there were blackouts and CP shops would at close at 6pm for a couple of weeks. But I did not see the kind of fear in the city that I am seeing now ” the 83-year-old says. “Though experts have said it is not necessary  many people are walking around with facemasks. It is only fuelling fear. My business is down by 80 percent.” A lot of his customers come from Odeon Cinema  one of over 150 cinemas that have downed their shutters across the city. On Friday  the box office is shut with a notice to the media. “This is what we have for reporters who come to check on the cinema ” says the security person there. “The footfall in CP is down by 50%  and restaurants and garments shops are struggling to attract customers despite extending the sale season and offering discounts ” says Atul Bhargava  president  New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA). “Our shops in malls are suffering more as people feel they are more susceptible to the contracting virus in a closed space of a mall ” says Mayank Mohan  CEO  Mohanlal Sons  a garment chain across Delhi and the national capital region. Even as Delhiites are trying to reduce all unnecessary contact  the city’s elderly are finding it difficult. Every day  a group of elderly people gather at the Senior Citizen Recreation Centre at Malviya Nagar. “Isolation is not a solution for us. Many among us live alone and suffer from loneliness. We cannot disband  but we ensure that we take all safety measures like washing and sanitising hands ” says Ashok Prabhakar  80  president  Senior Citizens Association  Malviya Nagar. “I am encouraging people not to worry  and have faith in God.” Prakash Chand  79  got “special permission” from his daughter-in-law to come to a Janakpuri park for a walk on Saturday morning. “She keeps telling me to wash my hands  not to touch my face  not to go to the local park  not to do this and that. I am finding it hard to keep up ” he says. “This new regimen is difficult to maintain.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-living-in-the-shadow-of-coronavirus/story-fUwogfuHl2ovbzXC7fHFrM.html

Com. semester VI examination as per its scheduled start from March 23. The division bench of acting chief justice BP Dharmadhikari and justice NR Borkar was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Prabhadevi resident Sagar Jondhale  raising concerns about spread of corona virus. Expressing urgent need to invoke the century old Epidemic Disease Act  1897  the 42-year-old has sought orders for forthwith setting up of Epidemic Disease Control Board for better prevention of spread of dangerous diseases. His counsel  advocate Milind Deshmukh  on Monday submitted a list of 17 suggestions for preventing spread of the novel coronavirus. The suggestions included closing schools and colleges for some period. Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade responded saying the state has taken several steps. Schools and colleges across the state are already closed  Kakade said  adding  besides malls  cinema theatres and such other crowded places are also ordered to be closed. Advocate Siddharth Ingle sought to intervene in the matter by tendering a letter addressed to the acting chief justice  pointing out that the MU was going ahead with its B. Com. semester VI examination  which is scheduled to start from March 23  for which over 3.50 lakh students are expected to appear. Ingle’s letter added that various measures are taken by the government  including imposition of section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code for preventing crowd formation  but some more colleges in Mumbai were also holding their semester examinations and steps are required to be taken to protect these students from possible spread of the deadly virus. Taking note of the letter  the bench issued notice to MU and posted the PIL for further hearing on Tuesday.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/exams-in-time-of-coronavirus-hc-issues-notice-to-mumbai-university-over-bcom-exams-on-march-23/story-kJrA41jA5QUD58uXN2nxVL.html

16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;germany;spain;united kingdom;croatia;ireland;italy;oman;romania;ukraine;united states,Donald Trump  Dems and politics surrounding coronavirus pandemic in US,A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.,Americans normally hear from President Donald Trump when he is opining on Twitter  riffing from a rally stage or otherwise improvising. This past week was different as he sat in the Oval Office with a script laid out for him to read on a matter grave enough for a prime-time address to the nation.President Donald Trump addressed the coronavirus crisis that is spreading germs and fear. But his words were as factually fraught as many of his tweets. He addressed the coronavirus crisis that is spreading germs and fear. But his words were as factually fraught as many of his tweets. Most broadly  Trump hailed American exceptionalism in health care and science — “The virus will not have a chance against us” — even as the public health system failed in making diagnostic testing accessible to all who need it. It’s been more than a week now since Trump assured the country: “Anybody  right now  and yesterday  anybody that needs a test  gets a test. They’re there. They have the test. And the test is beautiful.” He persisted with that thought as recently as Thursday  a day after his Oval Office address  when he asserted “the testing has been going very smooth.” This  as the government’s top infection expert  Dr. Anthony Fauci  was telling lawmakers: “It is a failing  let’s admit it.” Meanwhile  in their first one-on-one debate matchup Sunday  Democratic presidential rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders made their own questionable statements on topics including the pandemic  Social Security and more. A review of the recent rhetoric and reality: EXCEPTIONALISM? TRUMP: “No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.” — Oval Office address Wednesday. THE FACTS: American resilience will be measured over time. But the U.S. is not more prepared than all other countries. Seven weeks since the first U.S. case of coronavirus was announced  the government cannot account for what could be thousands of additional infections because of continuing stumbles on testing. Nearly a month after U.S. health officials promised to tap into a national network of labs that monitor for flu  that system is only just getting started. Large-scale testing is a critical part of tracking the spread of infectious diseases and allocating resources for treatment. The lack of comprehensive figures means U.S. health providers could quickly be overwhelmed by undetected cases. Fauci told a congressional hearing that other countries grappling with the virus have been making it easy for people to get tested  but in the U.S.  “the system is not really geared to what we need right now.” For most people  COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms  such as fever and cough. For some  especially older adults and people with health problems  it can cause more severe illness  including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from it. TRUMP: “If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back  we’re testing. We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested. ... We’re not putting them on planes if it shows positive  but if they do come here  we’re quarantining. There’s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.” -- remarks Thursday. THE FACTS: That’s not true. All people coming to the U.S. are not subject to mandatory  universal testing  nor are they being forced to quarantine. As well  his proclamation detailing the broad travel restrictions that took effect midnight Friday night on visitors from most of Europe does not specify that everyone allowed in will have to be tested. Trump was probably referring to plans that are expected to be put in place soon to channel those arriving from many European countries to certain U.S. airports  where they will receive screening and be subjected to quarantine instructions  just like visitors from China. TRUMP: “Taking early intense action  we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. “ — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: “Seen” so far may be true. But that does not mean Europe is being hit harder by infections than the United States. Because of test shortages in the U.S.  many Americans with COVID-19 aren’t being diagnosed and counted. TRUMP: “The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result  a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: That’s a distorted account of travel restrictions in Europe. By the time U.S. travel restrictions were announced on Jan. 31  many major European airlines had already cut service to China. While restrictions in some European countries were not as widespread  others were much broader. The Czech Republic had stopped issuing visas to Chinese citizens. Germany issued a travel advisory urging citizens to postpone nonessential travel to China. Italy had declared a state of emergency for six months. Russia had shut down its land border with China  as well as almost all train traffic and most flights there. Trump on Jan. 31 signed an order that would temporarily bar entry to the U.S. of foreign nationals  other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents  who have traveled in China within the last 14 days. The ban took effect Feb. 2. A recent study from the journal Science found China’s internal crackdown modestly delayed the spread of the virus but it cast doubt that travel restrictions elsewhere will do much compared with other preventive measures. Despite Trump’s boast of “early intense action ” his former homeland security adviser  Tom Bossert  said restrictions on entry into the U.S. from Europe came too late. “We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe ” he tweeted. WHAT’S COVERED TRUMP: “Earlier this week  I met with the leaders of (the) health insurance industry  who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments  extend insurance coverage to these treatments  and to prevent surprise medical billing.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: No  they did not say they will cover copays for treatment. As Vice President Mike Pence stated more accurately  the insurers agreed to cover coronavirus testing with no cost sharing — so no copays or deductibles. That assurance applies to tests that can confirm or rule out the virus  and doesn’t extend to treatment or to other tests that the patient’s doctor may order. Consumers should check with their insurance company because policies may vary on this. They should not count on the president’s word. What’s more  in the process of diagnosing COVID-19  other tests may be ordered. Insurers have not pledged to waive cost-sharing for those. Copays and deductibles may apply for imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans of the chest  for example  and hospital stays are also subject to cost-sharing. Federal programs including Medicare  Medicaid  children’s health insurance and “Obamacare” all cover the coronavirus tests. Of particular importance  clinical diagnostic tests are covered under Medicare with no cost-sharing  a longstanding policy. But cost-sharing may apply for other tests  such as imaging. When people get sick from the coronavirus  there currently is no antiviral treatment that can cure the disease. Instead  the current treatment is geared to relieving patients’ symptoms and helping them to recover. For those who are very sick  that can involve using machinery to help them breathe. Insurers cover such treatment based on the terms of the individual’s health plan  including any applicable deductibles and copays. TESTS & TREATMENT TRUMP: “We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: People with COVID-19 or those who get it in the outbreak should not expect those therapies to be available to them. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told a congressional committee Wednesday that while antivirals are being tested  “we don’t know if it works. I don’t want to promise anything.” An antiviral is a medicine that specifically attacks a virus to hasten recovery. An experimental drug named remdesivir  which was being developed to fight Ebola  is being tested in COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and abroad. There also are studies underway using combinations of some HIV-attacking drugs. TRUMP: “For decades the @CDCgov looked at  and studied  its testing system  but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic  but a pandemic would never happen  they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further..... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster  with thousands dying  and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem  until now.” — tweets Friday. THE FACTS: His newfound disdain for the CDC’s actions and his criticisms of the Obama administration are based on a faulty description of what happened in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic  initially called “swine flu.” Then  the CDC’s flu surveillance network actually sounded the alarm  spotting two children in California who were the first diagnosed cases of the new flu strain. About two weeks later  the U.S. declared a public health emergency and the CDC began releasing anti-flu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready. Trump declared a state of emergency Friday  nearly two months after the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. was announced. As for thousands dying  it actually turned out that the new H1N1 strain was less deadly than average seasonal flu. But even that comparison is problematic because regular flu years are deadliest for the elderly while H1N1 was riskiest for younger people. TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS TRUMP: “We will be suspending all travel from Europe  except the United Kingdom  for the next 30 days.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: He inaccurately described his own plan. First  the restriction does not apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S. or their families when they are returning from Europe. It also does not apply to U.S. citizens coming back from Europe  as Trump acknowledged. As well  it apparently does not apply to Ireland  Romania  Croatia  Ukraine and several other European states. The proclamation released by the White House says the travel ban affects the 26 European countries in the Schengen Area. That’s most of Europe  but not “all.” TRUMP: “These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo  but various other things as we get approval.” — Oval Office address. THE FACTS: That is wrong. The White House quickly clarified that the restriction on movement from Europe “only applies to human beings  not goods and cargo.” CHEAP GAS TRUMP: “Good for the consumer  gasoline prices coming down!” — tweet on March 9  after the price of oil fell nearly 20% and the stock market  already shaken by the coronavirus outbreak  took an even deeper dive. TRUMP: “So with gasoline prices coming down  that’s like a tax cut. Frankly  that’s like a big tax cut  not a little tax cut for the consumer. So there’s something about that that I like.” — remarks Thursday. THE FACTS: His affection for cheaper prices at the pump is widely shared. It’s just that cheaper gas increasingly comes at a cost. The price decline could hurt overall economic growth  which is probably a bigger negative on balance than saving at the pump. A drop in oil prices is not as helpful to the U.S. economy as it was when the country was massively dependent on foreign oil. That’s because the fracking revolution has made domestic oil and natural gas production a major part of the U.S. economy. A drop in prices hurts that domestic industry. It leads to less drilling  fewer jobs  cuts in factory orders and a host of aftershocks that could leave the nation as a whole worse off. The last time oil prices dropped by a comparable amount  in 2015-2016  it contributed to a slowing of economic growth from 2.9% to 1.6%. DEMOCRATIC DEBATE SANDERS: “We’re the only major country on earth not to guarantee health (care for) all people. We’re spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic.” BIDEN: “It has nothing to do with ‘Medicare for All’ — that wouldn’t solve the problem at all.” THE FACTS: Biden has a point. The coronavirus pandemic has taken countries by surprise regardless of the type of health care system that they have. Spain has a single-payer system  known as “social security” in that country. Italy guarantees coverage for all through a regionally based system. But both countries have struggled to get control of the outbreak  and their governments have been forced to take stringent measures not yet seen in this country. BIDEN: “A Medicare option. We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can get that done  if I’m president of the United States of America.” THE FACTS: That’s no guarantee. It’s a promise. The health insurance industry is dead set against a public option — a government plan that would compete with private insurers — and would fight it. So would many Republicans and perhaps even some Democrats. Democrats originally sought a public plan as part of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. But they lacked the votes to get it through the Senate  even when they held a commanding majority in that chamber. The same fight would play out again if Biden is elected president. Whether he’s able to secure a public plan depends on the composition of the Senate. SANDERS  to Biden: “You have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again talking about the need to cut Social Security  Medicare and veterans programs. Is that true or is that not true?” BIDEN: “That is not true.” THE FACTS: Sanders’ accusation is misleading. He suggests that Biden’s record shows that he would be hostile to preserving Social Security. In fact  Biden’s position has actually evolved over his long public career as a centrist senator. Cutting Social Security is not what he is proposing now. Biden’s campaign has pointed to a long list of legislation he supported that increased Social Security benefits. But as an influential legislator who had a hand in passing major bills  he also was willing to enter negotiations with Republicans by considering a reduction in cost-of-living increases. Often these changes were presented as a way to cut costs that would save the program. During a 1996 candidate debate  for example  he floated the possibility of reducing cost-of-living increases and raising the retirement age to 68. Sanders and his allies have also circulated video footage  news stories and transcripts of Biden’s past remarks. But in some cases  what appears to be a sweeping statement by Biden lack crucial context. One of the principal examples is a clip from a 2018 speech in which Biden appeared to discuss in favorable terms then-House Speaker Paul Ryan’s comments that a rising deficit demanded action on the popular entitlement programs. However  video  circulated on Twitter by a top Sanders adviser  used only a snippet of Biden’s remarks and avoided his larger criticism over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates. Other widely distributed videos of Biden as a U.S. senator from Delaware in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 show him explaining his support for a more austere federal budget  including putting Social Security and Medicare “on the table.” “When I argued that we should freeze federal spending  I meant Social Security  as well ” Biden said during a 1995 speech on the Senate floor. “I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans’ benefits. ... And I not only tried it once  I tried it twice  I tried it a third time and I tried it a fourth time.” The remarks were delivered in support of a federal balanced budget amendment that ultimately failed to win approval and did not relate directly to legislation that would have cut or frozen Social Security spending — or any other specific program. Yet as Biden himself acknowledged at the time  Social Security would likely have faced cuts if such a measure had been approved. As the Democratic Party moved leftward — a development that tracks along ever-widening income and wealth inequality — Biden has moved with it. His 2020 campaign platform now calls for raising taxes on upper-income households to shore up Social Security and expanding benefits for some of the oldest seniors. “There will be no compromise on Medicare and Social Security  period ” Biden said Jan. 20 in Des Moines  Iowa. SANDERS: “I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout. ... The Fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world. That was essentially a grant.” THE FACTS: Sanders is mischaracterizing the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and the stimulus efforts by the Bush and Obama administrations as merely giveaways to banks and Wall Street. It’s true that banks disproportionately benefited from the bailout  but the layoffs and foreclosures of that time would have been even worse without the government’s fiscal and monetary intervention. First  the Fed cut the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans to near-zero in late 2008 as the economy was cratering. It also bought government debt and mortgage-backed securities that expanded the central bank’s balance sheet to historic highs. These were not grants as Sanders suggests  but efforts to increase the flow of money into the U.S. economy in order to halt the downturn and boost hiring  business investment and consumer spending. Second  Sanders suggests that efforts such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program were in spirit rewarding bankers who should have been criminally prosecuted. But the loans and other initiatives stemming from TARP were about stabilizing the financial markets and other sectors of the economy. Biden correctly noted that failing to stabilize those institutions could have made the situation even bleaker for everyday Americans. BIDEN: “I’m taking all the precautions. I make sure I don’t touch my face.” THE FACTS: As many Americans have discovered  that’s easier said than done. He defied two recommended precautions during the debate  coughing into his hand  not his elbow  and touching his face several times  once with his hand on his chin.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-dems-and-politics-surrounding-coronavirus-pandemic-in-us/story-MWkY7MsHkm44k8r7foHVfK.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;ireland;mali,Coronavirus  travel bans may force airlines to go bankrupt by May: Report,Across the world  airlines have announced drastic reduction in their operations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.,Due to the coronavirus pandemic  most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May and only a coordinated government and industry action right now can avoid the catastrophe  said global aviation consultancy firm CAPA in a note on Monday.  “As the impact of the coronavirus and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world  many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy  or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants ” it stated.  Across the world  airlines have announced drastic reduction in their operations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. For example  Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines stated on Sunday that it would be grounding 300 aircraft in its fleet and reduce flights by 40 per cent.  The US has suspended all tourist visas for people belonging to the European Union  the UK and Ireland. Similarly  the Indian government has suspended all tourist visas and e-visas granted on or before March 11.  CAPA  in its note on Monday  said  “By the end of May-2020  most airlines in the world will be bankrupt. Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided.”   Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and “what flights there are operate much less than half full”  it added.  “Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation it is to discourage flying. Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon ” it said.  India’s largest airline IndiGo -- which has around 260 planes in its fleet -- said on Thursday that it has seen a decline of 15-20 per cent in daily bookings in the last few days.  The low-cost carrier had stated that it expects its quarterly earnings to be materially impacted due to such decline.  CAPA said the failure to coordinate the future will result in protectionism and much less competition.  “The alternative does not bear thinking about. An unstructured and nationalistic outcome will not be survival of the fittest.  “It will mostly consist of airlines that are the biggest and the best-supported by their governments. The system will reek of nationalism. And it will not serve the needs of the 21st century world. That is not a prospect that any responsible government should be prepared to contemplate ” the consultancy firm said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/coronavirus-travel-bans-may-force-airlines-to-go-bankrupt-by-may-report/story-Ao0McUecwa738bdsGgKBRP.html

Oman said that as of Tuesday it would allow in only GCC citizens  and ordered the suspension of Friday prayers  social events such as weddings and closure of public parks. Saudi Arabia reported 15 more coronavirus cases  taking its total to 118. Local municipalities tweeted directives for the closure of malls  restaurants  coffee shops and public parks  while exempting supermarkets  pharmacies and food delivery. Al Arabiya TV said the measures would apply across the country. State news agency SPA reported that government operations were suspended for 16 days except for the health and security sectors. The justice ministry said earlier non-urgent judicial hearings were postponed indefinitely. Regional tourism and business hub Dubai joined the UAE capital Abu Dhabi in closing cinemas  arcades  spas  gyms and parks  prompting a rush on supermarkets where many shoppers wore masks and gloves  residents said.

Iranian media said Zarif thanked the UAE  which has facilitated medical supply shipments.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gulf-nations-on-verge-of-lockdown-as-coronavirus-spreads-in-the-middle-east/story-Y8CP9xqhec6duZabRYFnVL.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china,China sees fewer coronavirus cases  wary of international travellers,Mainland China had 16 new confirmed cases on Sunday  the National Health Commission said on Monday  down from 20 a day earlier. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in China so far to 80 860.,Mainland China reported an overall drop in new coronavirus infections on Sunday  but major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai continued to wrestle with cases involving infected travellers arriving from abroad. Mainland China had 16 new confirmed cases on Sunday  the National Health Commission said on Monday  down from 20 a day earlier. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in China so far to 80 860. Of the new figures  12 were imported infections  exceeding locally transmitted cases for the third day. Beijing accounted for four of the cases  Guangdong province four  Shanghai two  Yunnan province one and Gansu province one. That brings the total number of imported cases to 123 so far. China has tightened checks on international travellers  with the capital of Beijing requiring anyone arriving from abroad to be transferred to city quarantine facilities for 14 days  starting Monday. Beijing has redirected all international flights that were scheduled to land at its new Daxing International Airport in the south to the older Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeast. Shanghai has designated hotels serving as quarantine venues for inbound international travellers  though the financial hub has not made it compulsory yet for all travellers to be quarantined at such venues on arrival. Mainland China’s only locally transmitted new infections on Sunday were in Wuhan  the epicentre of the outbreak and capital of Hubei province  with four cases. It was the 11th consecutive day that the central province recorded zero new infections outside of Wuhan. The death toll from the outbreak in China had reached 3 213 as of the end of Sunday  up by 14 from the previous day. In Hubei  there were 14 new deaths  with Wuhan accounting for 13 of the fatalities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-fewer-coronavirus-cases-wary-of-international-travellers/story-avFSED6Zha9dqUTe5t62qN.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,germany;oman;united states,Germany tries to halt US interest in firm working on coronavirus vaccine: Report,German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told a news conference that the government’s coronavirus crisis committee would discuss the CureVac case on Monday.,Berlin is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a coronavirus vaccine to move its research to the United States  prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine. German government sources told Reuters on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm  CureVac. Earlier  the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States  and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay. Responding to the report  the U.S. ambassador to Germany  Richard Grenell  wrote on Twitter: “The Welt story was wrong.” A U.S. official said: “This story is wildly overplayed ... We will continue to talk to any company that claims to be able to help. And any solution found would be shared with the world.” A German Health Ministry spokeswoman  confirming a quote in the newspaper  said: “The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe.” “In this regard  the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac ” she added. Welt am Sonntag quoted an unidentified German government source as saying Trump was trying to secure the scientists’ work exclusively  and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States  “but only for the United States.” German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told a news conference that the government’s coronavirus crisis committee would discuss the CureVac case on Monday. CureVac issued a statement on Sunday  in which it said: “The company rejects current rumours of an acquisition”. CureVac’s main investor Dietmar Hopp said he was not selling and wanted CureVac to develop a coronavirus vaccine to “help people not just regionally but in solidarity across the world.” “I would be glad if this could be achieved through my long-term investments out of Germany ” he added. A German Economy Ministry spokeswoman said Berlin “has a great interest” in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.  She cited Germany’s foreign trade law  under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU  so-called third countries “if national or European security interests are at stake”.  EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE Florian von der Muelbe  CureVac’s chief production officer and co-founder  told Reuters last week the company had started with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials. The privately-held company based in Tuebingen  Germany hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans. On its website  CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met Trump  Vice President Mike Pence  members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine. CureVac in 2015 and 2018 secured financial backing for development projects from its investor the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  working on shots to prevent malaria and influenza. In the field of so-called mRNA therapeutics  CureVac competes with U.S. biotech firm Moderna and German rival BioNTech  which Pfizer has identified as a potential collaboration partner. Drugs based on mRNA provide a type of genetic blueprint that can be injected into the body to instruct cells to produce the desired therapeutic proteins. That contrasts with the conventional approach of making these proteins in labs and bio-reactors. In the case of vaccines  the mRNA prompts body cells to produce so-called antigens  the tell-tale molecules on the surface of viruses  that spur the immune system into action. Companies working on other coronavirus-vaccine approaches include Johnson & Johnson and INOVIO Pharmaceuticals  Inc..,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-tries-to-halt-us-interest-in-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine-report/story-2vkXRNA8dwlT5dtf8PngJI.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,australia;oman,Australia mulls second stimulus package to tackle coronavirus: Report,Australia has recorded nearly 300 cases of coronavirus and authorities fear a rapid rise in the flu-like respiratory disease.,Australia is considering a second round of economic stimulus  three sources familiar with the deliberations told Reuters  as Canberra accelerated efforts to contain the spread of the  coronavirus that has now killed five people in the country. Australia has recorded nearly 300 cases of coronavirus and authorities fear a rapid rise in the flu-like respiratory disease. The spread of the virus has roiled global markets despite pledges of stimulus packages  including Australia’s plan to inject A$17.6 billion ($11.4 billion) into its economy.  As Australian markets slumped further on Monday  Prime Minister Scott Morrison will meet with senior Cabinet officials to discuss a potential “scaling-up” of its stimulus package  three sources told Reuters. Earlier  Australia’s central bank said it was ready to purchase local government bonds to support the smooth functioning of the market and will announce further policy measures later this week. The Reserve Bank of Australia also pumped extra liquidity into the banking system  part of a package of measures aimed at ensuring business and households have access to credit as travel and industry are disrupted. Australia’s corporate regulator asked some participants in the equity market to limit the number of trades they execute each day by up to 25% after a huge spike in volumes last week.  The moves  however  did little to calm market jitters  with the local share market falling as much as 7% in morning trading. STATE OF EMERGENCY As Australian financial policymakers and regulators moved to underpin its markets  Australia’s capital and the country’s second most populous state declared states of emergency to slow the spread of the outbreak.  After a 77-year-old woman and a 90-year-old woman died in New South Wales  Victoria state and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - home to the capital city of Canberra - both declared a state of emergency that will give health officials sweeping powers.  The proclamations allows the Victoria state and ACT’s chief health officers to issue fresh quarantine orders to cover entire suburbs  businesses or professions if deemed necessary. “These powers have never been used before ” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne  the state capital of Victoria. “This  I hope provides a clear sense about the unprecedented nature of this public health emergency  this really significant challenge.”  The Victoria state of emergency will run for four weeks  while the ACT declaration will be in force for at least a week. Western Australia state declared a state of emergency on Sunday. Nationally  Australia is tightening its borders  with Morrison on Sunday ordering everyone arriving from overseas to self-isolate for 14 days. Australia has also banned non-essential social gatherings of more than 500 people  though this not apply for public transport  work or schools. Still  many offices are asking employees to work from home and several leading universities on Monday shuttered for at least a week. Australia’s parliament  which is scheduled to sit next week has also restricted access to visitors  while Morrison said lawmakers will be asked to limit the number of staff members that come to Canberra next week. Hundreds of Australians have begun stockpiling goods  from staples to sanitizers  clearing supermarket shelves. The country’s biggest grocer  Woolworths Group  said on Monday it would open exclusively for an hour in the morning from Tuesday until at least Friday for elderly Australians and people with disabilities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-mulls-second-stimulus-package-to-tackle-coronavirus-report/story-QI6Pr8Xf292I0wQPOrTsGK.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;italy;mali;oman,FIR against Agra man for hiding coronavirus positive status of daughter,Agra district magistrate (DM) Prabhu N Singh ordered the filing of an First Information Report (FIR) against the father for misleading a team of doctors.,A case was registered on Sunday against the father of a woman who tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) for concealing his daughter’s illness and misleading the health department officials who had gone to his house to get her admitted to the isolation ward in SN Medical College and Hospital. Agra district magistrate (DM) Prabhu N Singh ordered the filing of an First Information Report (FIR) against the father for misleading a team of doctors. The woman  who lives in Agra Cantonment railway colony  had recently travelled to Italy for her honeymoon. After the couple returned  her husband tested positive for Covid-19 in Bengaluru  while she returned to her family here. The case was registered under Section 269 (unlawfully or negligently doing something which is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life) and Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code at Sadar Bazar police station. The complaint was lodged by Dr Vinay Kumar  additional chief medical officer (ACMO). “Twelve samples were sent to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College under Aligarh Muslim University for Covid-19 test on Thursday ” Kumar said. “Eleven samples were found negative. However  the woman’s sample  was suspected to be positive because her husband had contracted the disease and was undergoing treatment in Bengaluru. She is in the highly suspect category ” said the complainant in his FIR. When the ACMO and additional city magistrate Vinod Joshi reached the woman’s house on Friday  her father lied to them and said she was travelling to Delhi by Mangla Express and from there she would take a flight to Bengaluru. The health officials informed the woman’s travel plans to DM Singh  who ordered filing of the FIR.   ‘The father of the Covid-19 positive woman caused a lot of trouble for the district administration and health department because of false and misleading information about his daughter’s departure to Delhi. Later  she was found in the house  which proved that he misled us ” the complainant said in the FIR. The woman’s sample was sent for reconfirmation to King George’s Medical University in Lucknow  and it tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. Senior superintendent of Police (SSP)  Agra  Babloo Kumar said that strict action would be taken against the accused. The accused and his other family members have been placed under home quarantine as they were in close contact with the Covid-19 patient.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-agra-man-for-hiding-coronavirus-positive-status-of-daughter/story-lZPbGjYUCPE2qXE4WQkeAN.html
16/03/2020,coronavirus;government;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;japan;united states,Coronavirus vaccine trials begin today: US government official,Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine as COVID-19 cases continue to grow.,The first participant in a clinical trial for a vaccine to protect against the new coronavirus will receive an experimental dose on Monday  according to a government official. The National Institutes of Health is funding the trial  which is taking place at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The official who disclosed plans for the first participant spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been publicly announced. Public health officials say it will take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine. Testing will begin with 45 young  healthy volunteers with different doses of shots co-developed by NIH and Moderna Inc. There’s no chance participants could get infected from the shots  because they don’t contain the virus itself. The goal is purely to check that the vaccines show no worrisome side effects  setting the stage for larger tests. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine as COVID-19 cases continue to grow. Importantly  they’re pursuing different types of vaccines — shots developed from new technologies that not only are faster to produce than traditional inoculations but might prove more potent. Some researchers even aim for temporary vaccines  such as shots that might guard people’s health a month or two at a time while longer-lasting protection is developed. Inovio Pharmaceuticals aims to begin safety tests of its vaccine candidate next month in a few dozen volunteers at the University of Pennsylvania and a testing center in Kansas City  Missouri  followed by a similar study in China and South Korea. Even if initial safety tests go well  “you’re talking about a year to a year and a half” before any vaccine could be ready for widespread use  according to Dr. Anthony Fauci  director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That still would be a record-setting pace. But manufacturers know the wait — required because it takes additional studies of thousands of people to tell if a vaccine truly protects and does no harm — is hard for a frightened public. President Donald Trump has been pushing for swift action on a vaccine  saying in recent days that the work is “moving along very quickly” and he hopes to see a vaccine “relatively soon.” Today  there are no proven treatments. In China  scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus  as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S.  the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan. For most people  the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms  such as fever and cough. For some  especially older adults and people with existing health problems  it can cause more severe illness  including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156 000 people and left more than 5 800 dead. The death toll in the United States is more than 50  while infections neared 3 000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization  people with mild illness recover in about two weeks  while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-trials-begin-today-us-government-official/story-efSfPW3igL1Vw8tzMC09PM.html

16/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,australia;china;spain;france;india;italy;pakistan,Biggest daily jump in cases as coronavirus spread worry intensifies,Experts have previously warned that the number of cases in the country is likely to surge as authorities keep a close watch on at least 4 000 people who came in contact with those infected.,The cases of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India rose to 107  with 23 more people testing positive for the infection on Sunday as the country recorded its highest single-day jump from a day before  while the central and state governments ramped up measures to avoid community transmission of the outbreak. At least four other people — two in Maharashtra  and one each in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh — were diagnosed with the illness in preliminary tests  which  if confirmed  will take the total infections to 111 in the country. Experts have previously warned that the number of cases in the country is likely to surge as authorities keep a close watch on at least 4 000 people who came in contact with those infected. About 45 000 more are under community surveillance and the figure is expected to rise as more patients are confirmed. Experts say that if a more stringent pre-emptive lockdown is not enforced across the country  the public health system could struggle with an exponential spike in the number of patients. Among other measures  they have called for an aggressive ramping up of testing to stave off the deadly infection  pointing out that the current capacity to screen people may prove to be inadequate in case of a sudden surge in infections  even as “self distancing” remained key. “Social distancing is one of the best-known measures to reduce virus transmission. The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets... By maintaining a distance  we can reduce the virus transmission ” the World Health Organization (WHO)’s South East Asia Region director Poonam Khetrapal Singh told Hindustan Times. Maharashtra  which reported 17 new infections on Sunday  now has the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country at 31. It is followed by Kerala  which recorded three new cases on Sunday  taking its total to 22. The remaining new Covid-19 cases were reported in Telangana (2) and Rajasthan (1). Special secretary at the Union ministry of health Sanjeeva Kumar said: “Twenty-three new cases have been detected since the last update... there are now 107 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country.”  India saw a sharp rise in infections in the first two weeks of this month  an over 35-fold increase from March 1  when there were just three confirmed cases in the country. The developments prompted the Union government to declare Covid-19 a “notified disaster” on Saturday to free up resources and funds to tackle the contagion that has been termed a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak  which has infected over 160 000 people and killed at least 6 000 globally  originated in China late last year but rapidly spread to at least 142 countries and territories. The epicentre of the contagion has since shifted to Europe  with Italy bearing the brunt of the virus’s spread and recording the second-highest number of deaths (at least 1 800) and cases (more than 21 000) after China. Iran and South Korea are the other worst-affected countries. Though most patients in India appear to have contracted the disease in foreign countries  authorities are working on a war footing to avoid community transmission of Covid-19  which was among the primary reasons for the rapid spread of the illness in Italy  Iran and South Korea. On Sunday  India’s apex biomedical research body  the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)  began its second batch of random testing of samples to keep a track of the outbreak in the country.  The confirmed 107 cases in India include 17 foreigners — 16 Italian tourists and a Canadian national — and the two deaths in Delhi and Karnataka.  In Maharashtra  15 people in Pune were diagnosed with the disease  five in the country’s financial capital Mumbai  four in Nagpur  two in Yavatmal and one each in Thane  Kalyan  Kamothe  Navi Mumbai and Ahmednagar. Two other cases — in Pune and Aurangabad — were yet to be confirmed  according to state officials. With the state activating laws that give it special powers to quarantine and impose a lockdown among other measures  the Mumbai Police on Sunday invoked Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to prohibit tour operators from organising any gatherings till March 31. Pune  too  is considering similar measures to limit the spread of the virus.  More states  including Assam  Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu  on Sunday ordered the closure of schools and public areas such as cinema halls and malls. India has already suspended most visas to the country and shut many land borders with neighbouring countries in a wide-reaching attempt to tackle the outbreak.  Extending the restrictions  the Centre suspended travel through the Kartarpur Corridor for pilgrimage to the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan from Sunday midnight. It further barred movement of all passengers to the neighbouring country through international border points. On Sunday  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan reviewed containment measures taken by states and Union territories and directed officials to scale up the capacity of round-the-clock helpline to address people’s queries  according to a statement.  The government has also asked Indian nationals to avoid all non-essential travel abroad and advised all incoming international passengers to monitor their health and consider self-isolation as a precaution. Several countries have imposed bans on mass gatherings  cancelled or delayed sporting events as medical experts across the world have urged people to practice “social distancing”. France and Spain on Sunday joined Italy in imposing lockdowns on tens of millions of people  Australia ordered self-isolation of arriving foreigners and other countries extended entry bans as the world sought to contain the spreading virus.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-daily-jump-in-cases-as-spread-worry-intensifies/story-Q0kMsQOGvvJugL4ekIH7QP.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Madhya Pradesh cabinet flags coronavirus threat day before floor test,The minister said the assembly will decide whether  proceeding should be postponed.,A day before the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh is to face a floor test in the assembly  a minister flagged the threat of coronavirus and suggested that proceedings in the House could be put off. Minister for public relations PC Sharma’s comment came at a briefing after a cabinet meeting on Sunday.  “The cabinet discussed how corona virus outbreak has led to postponement of state assemblies in several states. However  whether it should be replicated in MP will be decided by the House only when it meets on Monday ” he said. The minister spoke at length on how coronavirus outbreak has affected 113 countries and that it has been declared as an epidemic worldwide. “Even in Lok Sabha there was a demand to postpone the proceedings in view of coronavirus outbreak ” he said. The number of coronavirus cases in the country has risen to 107 even as the Central and state governments scaled up their response to stop the virus from spreading. Two persons have died of the disease in Delhi and Karnataka. Late Saturday night  Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon directed chief minister Kamal Nath to seek a trust vote in the assembly on Monday  days after 22 Congress legislators resigned en masse leaving the government staring at a collapse. With 19 rebel MLAs ensconced in Bengaluru  the Congress had taken about 80 of its legislators to Jaipur to prevent poaching by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress lawmakers who returned from Jaipur on Sunday have been taken to hotel where they will stay till the floor test on Monday.  Sharma insisted that the MLAs who are in Bengaluru were kidnapped and hypnotized.  “Our MLAs have been kidnapped and held captive in Bengaluru. On seeing them it appears they have been hypnotised and subjected to tantra-mantra (black magic).” The Congress lawmakers who returned from Jaipur  insist that the government will survive the floor test despite the resignations of the 22 MLAs.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-minister-flags-coronavirus-threat-day-before-floor-test/story-QAkzHP66D4qs4WicAWqhyM.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,australia;india;canada,Australia’s Morrison calls for urgent G-20 finance meeting as covid-19 wreaks havoc on economy,Morrison said he supported a proposal by India Prime Minister Narendra Modi to organize a link-up between G-20 leaders.,Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Sunday for an urgent meeting of finance chiefs from the world’s top industrial and emerging nations amid market turmoil spurred by the coronavirus outbreak. Detailing his talks with world leaders  Morrison said he supported a proposal by India Prime Minister Narendra Modi to organize a link-up between G-20 leaders. He also held a call with U.K. counterpart Boris Johnson and both agreed that finance chiefs need to meet. “The Prime Minister (Boris Johnson) and I agreed last night that an even more urgent meeting that would be needed would be a further meeting of the G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors ” Morrison told reporters in Sydney. Citing market volatility  Morrison said the G-20 should coordinate actions similar to ones rolled out during the global financial crisis. “We’ve seen some highly volatile  quite disruptive activity on our financial markets ” Morrison said. “We want to be assured through our cooperation -- as occurred through the GFC among that G-20 group -- that we can make sure that there is no further damage or undermining of financial markets and the central bank governors and financial ministers are in best place to do that.” G7 leaders have already signaled they would hold a video conference on the coronavirus early next week. Canada’s Justin Trudeau said the members agreed to coordinate their response. The market panic comes amid daily signs the global economy is powering down as countries enforce new restrictions on travel and movement. A rush by central banks and governments to slash interest rates and unleash more than $130 billion in fiscal stimulus hasn’t been enough to stop the rout. Trading volatility spiked to levels not seen since the financial crisis in 2008 as the S&P 500 Index’s historic bull run came to an end -- the gauge fell the most since 1987 before retracing some of those losses. Signs of illiquidity also emerged across global credit markets and the $17 trillion U.S. government-bond market  while the dollar staged its biggest jump in 12 years. The G-20 released an emergency statement on March 7 that echoed one released by the Group of Seven nations  which ultimately disappointed investors. “This has been a very fast-moving event ” Morrison said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/australia-s-morrison-calls-for-urgent-g-20-finance-meeting-as-covid-19-wreaks-havoc-on-economy/story-GNnuq9fu8zOsuwkceAKKrI.html

Overseas investors pulled out a net sum of Rs 24 776.36 crore from equities and Rs 13 199.54 crore from the debt segment between Mar 2-13  depositories data showed. This translates into a total net outflow of Rs 37 975.90 crore during the period under review. Prior to this  foreign investors were net buyers for six consecutive months since September 2019. “The spread of coronavirus outbreak  which has now been declared a pandemic  and continued slowdown in the global economy  has created a vicious cycle which is consuming investors worldwide ” said Himanshu Srivastava  senior analyst manager research  Morningstar Investment Adviser India. Global markets reeled last week after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic  and expressed deep concern over the “alarming levels of inaction”. Given the ongoing scenario  foreign investors have taken a flight to safer investment options  such as dollar denominated asset classes and gold as against fixed income securities of emerging markets like India  he added. Going forward  as coronavirus crosses boundaries and affects other countries  it may have a more serious impact on the already slowing global economy and on foreign flows into emerging markets such as India  Srivastava said. “The markets have been very volatile all over the globe. Many countries are expected to announce stimulus packages and tax breaks to support various industries as they deal with the effects of this virus’ outbreak. When such announcements are made  investors’ sentiments are expected to change ” said Harsh Jain  co-founder and COO at Groww.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/covid-19-effect-makes-fpis-withdraw-rs-37k-cr-from-indian-markets/story-oU64PQE6sdtqWkJo4YvTvK.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,289 people on Dubai-Kochi flight offloaded after passenger tests coronavirus positive,The coronavirus outbreak has the government working on a war-footing to minimise the spread of the disease.,All 289 people on board Dubai-bound flight from Kochi were asked to deplane right before take-off after it became known that a passenger tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus  said news agency PTI quoting airport officials. The passenger  who is a UK national  belonged to a group of 19 holidaying in the hill resort town of Munnar in Kerala and was under surveillance  a Cochin International Airport Limited spokesman said. He joined the group to reach the Kochi airport without informing authorities in Munnar  said the spokesman. When the test result came  the authorities came to know that he was at the Kochi airport and travelling by an Emirates flight.  Though the rate of fatality is very low in case of coronavirus  it is very infectious. The virus starts from the upper respiratory system  and from the back of the throat moves to lower respiratory system like lungs  and finally to blood. Once inside the body  the virus uses a spike-like protein to bind with a receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) found on the respiratory cells  entering it and replicating to spread the infection within. As the virus keeps multiplying  it causes inflammation in the alveoli or lung sacs filling them fluid and pus causing pneumonia. The inflamed lungs make it difficult for the person to breathe leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome between day eight and day 15 of the onset of symptoms. From imported cases to local transmission  Kerala had pressed the emergency button announcing a series of measures to check the spread of the virus. The state health department has called for strict community surveillance  scaling up of contact tracing and tapping local bodies to check the spread of the deadly disease. Two important shrines  Guruvayoor and Sabarimala  have scaled down their daily grind. The Nair Service Society has also asked people to skip big gatherings. Cinema halls have also announced closure and film units also suspended their shooting. Hotels and resorts have been asked not to entertain foreign guests till further notice. The state had reported India’s first three cases of coronavirus in January this year. They have now recovered fully. The coronavirus outbreak has the government working on a war-footing to minimise the spread of the disease.  Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said the government has issued an advisory asking civil hospitals and medical colleges to set up isolation wards. “We are trying our best to contain the spread of coronavirus which has spread to 12 states ” said the minister.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-on-board-dubai-bound-flight-from-kochi-asked-to-deplane-as-passenger-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-pti/story-IQA6Q8Evu3QEU9q2WFqHGO.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;oman,Communist party member missing after criticising Xi’s handling of covid-19 outbreak,Ren Zhiqiang  a member of China’s ruling Communist Party and a former top executive of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group  has not been contactable since March 12  they said.,An influential former Chinese property executive who called President Xi Jinping a “clown” over a speech he made last month about the government’s efforts to battle the coronavirus has gone missing  three of his friends told Reuters.  Ren Zhiqiang  a member of China’s ruling Communist Party and a former top executive of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group  has not been contactable since March 12  they said.  “Many of our friends are looking for him ” his close friend and businesswoman Wang Ying said in a statement to Reuters  describing them as being “extremely anxious”. “Ren Zhiqiang is a public figure and his disappearance is widely know. The institutions responsible for this need to give a reasonable and legal explanation for this as soon as possible ” she said.  Calls made by Reuters to Ren’s mobile phone went unanswered. The Beijing police did not immediately respond to requests by phone and fax for comment on Sunday. China’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. An essay Ren shared with people he knew in recent weeks took aim at a speech Xi made on Feb. 23  which state media reported was teleconferenced to 170 000 party officials nationwide. Copies of his essay were later posted online by others. In the essay  which does not mention Xi by name  Ren said after studying the speech he “saw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his ‘new clothes ’ but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor ” according to a version posted by China Digital Times  a U.S.-based website. He also said it revealed a “crisis of governance” within the party  and that a lack of free press and speech had prevented the outbreak from being tackled sooner  causing the situation to worsen.  Ren’s disappearance comes as censorship over how local media and online users discuss the epidemic has tightened in recent weeks. The coronavirus  which emerged in China late last year  has infected more than 80 000 people in the country  killing 3 199.  Ren  who gained the nickname “Cannon Ren” for previous critiques posted on social media  was put on probation from the party for a year in 2016 as part of a punishment for publicly criticising government policy.  That year  the government ordered platforms such as the Twitter-like Weibo to shut down Ren’s social media accounts  which at the time had more than 30 million online followers  saying he had been “spreading illegal information”. Beijing has framed the battle against coronavirus as a “People’s War” led by Xi.  While the draconian measures to fight the virus  including the lockdown of the city of Wuhan  have proven effective at containing it even as the disease spreads rapidly in other countries  China has faced criticism for suppressing information in the outbreak’s early days.

In an extraordinary development  12 of Britain’s biggest grocers will publish advertisements in national newspapers today and tomorrow. Entitled “Working to Feed the Nation ” the letter reassures shoppers about steps being taken to ensure adequate supplies in stores and asks them to be considerate: “We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.” The supermarkets behind the letter include the “Big Four” -- Tesco Plc  J Sainsbury Plc  WM Morrison Plc and Asda Group Ltd -- as well as the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Other retailers that have signed up include Marks & Spencer Plc  online grocer Ocado and Waitrose. The spread of the coronavirus across Europe  which is now the epicenter of the pandemic according to the World Health Organization  has fueled the urge to stockpile. Tesco  Britain’s largest grocer  has already had to move to restrict sales of antibacterial products  dried pasta  long-life milk  children’s medicines  water and tinned vegetables to five items a person in stores. Other grocers have restrictions in place too.

15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,Coronavirus pushes China’s poor rat meat farmers to brink of despair,Beijing has now clamped down on trading wild animals due to the coronavirus  potentially destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers.,Bamboo rat meat  a once profitable commodity China’s poor traded for quick returns  now risks pushing those farmers back into poverty. Many local governments had encouraged impoverished citizens to breed the animal  offering financial incentives as part of poverty-relief measures. But Beijing has now clamped down on trading wild animals due to the coronavirus  potentially destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers. “Many breeders are poor farmers living in mountainous areas  and have no other income ” said Cheng Bujun  who runs a rat farm in the Guangxi region. “Some of them are disabled or elderly who can hardly find jobs in cities.” His company buys baby rats from these farmers who were given parent rats for free by local authorities  Cheng said. Breeding the rats is the only source of revenue for his contract farmers who live in a poor village in the southwest province of Guizhou  and the ban will return them to poverty  he said. China has a target of lifting more than 5 million people in rural areas out of poverty by the end of this year  but the coronavirus epidemic  which is widely believed to have spread from a wild animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan  could derail those plans. Stopping the bamboo rat meat trade alone puts an end to an annual business worth $1.4 billion. “Some parts of China have been breeding bamboo rats for the last 30 years ” said Liu Kejun  a senior researcher with the Guangxi Animal Husbandry Research Institute. “Artificially-bred bamboo rats are different from wild ones” and should be strictly monitored  but not banned  he said. GOOD PROFITS The rats provide quick returns due to their low investment costs  and are the most effective way of getting farmers out of poverty  Liu said. The animals only eat bamboo and sugarcane and can be bred in small spaces. A rural family that rears 20 rat pairs can make 10 000 yuan to 15 000 yuan ($1 430 to $2 150) the following year  he said  way above the country’s poverty level and enough for a rural family to live on. Since China last month moved to ban all wild animals for consumption  the agricultural ministry has been updating a list of exempt animals. Liu and large breeders sent a proposal to Beijing to ask the government to include bamboo rats on the list  according to a document seen by Bloomberg. There are about 66 million artificially-bred bamboo rats in China. In Guangxi  the annual market value of the animal is about 2.8 billion yuan. Of the 180 000 breeders in the region  nearly 20% are from low-income rural families  according to the proposal. VIRUS CONCERNS Still  the prospect of bamboo rats being added to the list is slim given that the country’s top infectious disease expert  Zhong Nanshan  said in January that bamboo rats and badgers are among the wild animals that could be the source of the new coronavirus. Farms that are breeding animals on the banned list will be shut down or compensated to switch to other businesses  Liu Yongfu  head of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development  said at a press conference on Thursday. Closing down the artificial breeding business won’t have a major impact on the country’s poverty relief target  he said. Bamboo rat meat is popular in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi  Guangdong  Hunan and Jiangxi  and was once promoted as a top 10 delicacy for tourists to try when visiting the Jinggang Mountains. A rat can produce 1.5 to 2 kilograms of meat  Guangxi Animal Husbandry’s Liu said. The meat can be stewed in soy sauce  or used in soups or barbecued. “A table filled with bamboo rat meat dishes only costs about 300 yuan for six or seven people ” Liu said. “It tastes very delicious.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pushes-china-s-poor-rat-meat-farmers-to-brink-of-despair/story-OFbZ3CG5eoDKwNMh43Y9iJ.html

15/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,brazil,US President Donald Trump tests negative for coronavirus,The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus  including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.,President Donald Trump has tested negative for the new coronavirus  according to the president’s personal physician. The White House released the test results Saturday night after Trump told reporters hours earlier that he had taken the coronavirus test  following days of resisting being screened despite the fact that he had been in recent contact with three people who have tested positive for the virus. Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday that he had his temperature taken and it was “totally normal ” shortly before stepping into the room to discuss the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2 200 people in the US and caused at least 50 deaths. The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus  including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires  Nestor Forster  tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So  too  have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro  who took a photo with Trump and attended a party with him  and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday  according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters. Trump  after days of insisting that he was not exhibiting symptoms of the virus  relented after being pressed by reporters about his resistance to testing when multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested  but also chosen to try to avoid potentially infecting others. The president  according to two people close to the White House  had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis  and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance. Trump came into office as self-described germaphobe who tried to avoid handshakes as he conducted his real estate business. But he acknowledged Saturday that he’s now finding it difficult to resist shaking hands  a habit that he says he’s picked up since becoming a full-time politician. At a news conference Friday to announce he was declaring a national emergency  Trump eagerly shook the hands of several corporate executives  even though health policy experts on White House coronavirus task force have urged Americans to avoid physical contact to help stem the spread of the virus. “People come up to me  they shake hands  they put their hand out ” Trump said. “It’s sort of a natural reflex  and we’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.” The White House is stepping up efforts to try to keep the virus at bay. On Saturday  the White House announced that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence  including reporters who attend a White House briefing and anyone entering the Oval Office. Pence also wrote a memo to White House staff Saturday reminding them to take precautions such as avoiding physical contact  washing hands frequently and staying home when sick. “It’s imperative each one of us do our part to take the proper precautions to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe ” Pence wrote. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex  we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us.” Dr. Deborah Birx  who is helping coordinate the US response to the outbreak  noted that testing results reflect a snapshot in time and that it’s crucial for people to maintain precautions. “When you get a negative test  that means you’re negative that day ” Birx said. “That doesn’t mean that you couldn’t get the virus spreading overnight  because it replicates in your nose and your nasal secretions  and you would have a positive test tomorrow.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-says-trump-tested-negative-for-coronavirus/story-iHRQ4YKNyict2f0vv0dTiI.html

15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;germany;spain;france;hong kong;indonesia;india;italy;japan;malaysia;nepal;singapore;thailand,Some flyers caught hiding travel details,After the mandated quarantine orders starting Friday  a total of 2 624 passengers were screened at the Delhi airport on Friday  of which at least 15 passengers were caught allegedly hiding their travel details from the Airport Health Organisation (APHO) officials during the immigration clearance.,In order to avoid forced quarantine  a number of passengers coming in from seven countries designated as high-risk for the novel coronavirus infection are allegedly taking detours to reach India and hiding details of their origin countries  officials said on Saturday. After the mandated quarantine orders starting Friday  a total of 2 624 passengers were screened at the Delhi airport on Friday  of which at least 15 passengers were caught allegedly hiding their travel details from the Airport Health Organisation (APHO) officials during the immigration clearance. Two of these passengers  who had reached Delhi from Spain via Dubai  were sent to the Delhi government’s quarantine facility on Friday. Five others  who had arrived from Frankfurt  were also sent to the quarantine facility. In its revised travel advisory issued on Wednesday  the government said that anyone arriving from seven countries – China  Italy  Iran  Republic of Korea  France  Spain and Germany – shall be quarantined  March 13 onwards. An immigration officer said that some passengers from these seven countries were caught trying to hide the details of their origin country. “They took a halt midway and after landing in Delhi  during their medical examination by the officials of APHO  produced the boarding pass of the second country  and did not reveal the details of their originating countries  in order to avoid mandatory quarantine ” the officer said  requesting anonymity. However  when the same passengers arrived at the dedicated immigration counters for their clearance  their full travel history was revealed  the officer added. “Friday onwards  as many as 2 664 passengers arrived from these seven countries and were scanned for coronavirus. Of these  two were identified and quarantined under category B. 15-20 others who were found hiding their travel itinerary were asked to go under self quarantine as they fall under category A. Five others  from Frankfurt  Germany  were also in category B and were sent to government quarantine facility from the airport ” the officer added. The categories of passengers have been divided on the basis of severity of symptoms  as issued by the APHO. While category A comprises the high--risk passengers  requiring mandatory segregation and isolation  who are directly sent to hospitals  those under category B pose a moderate risk  and need to be shifted to dedicated state government’s quarantine facility. Passengers in category C  with low risk  need to be kept under home quarantine and are monitored. Last week  arrangements were made at Delhi airport to completely isolate passengers arriving Delhi airport from 12 countries -- China  South Korea  Japan  Iran  Italy  Singapore  Thailand  Malaysia  Hong Kong  Vietnam  Nepal and Indonesia. Their baggage belt  immigration counters  customs clearance area and pick and drop point outside the international arrival terminal were segregated from other passengers.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-flyers-caught-hiding-travel-details/story-mjmUSX5c4FVPEcXGiFBESL.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,italy,Coronavirus positive Delhi man  46  came in contact with 813 people,The man’s 68-year-old mother  who was also infected with the novel coronavirus  died at a hospital on Friday night  the second death caused by the disease in the country.,From landing at the Delhi airport after his return from Italy on February 20  to the time he was diagnosed with the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on March 12  a 46-year-old man from west Delhi’s Janakpuri came in contact with 813 people  the maximum for any patient so far in Delhi  according to contact-tracing efforts by health care professionals. The man’s 68-year-old mother  who was also infected with the novel coronavirus  died at a hospital on Friday night  the second death caused by the disease in the country.  Family members of the 46-year-old said he recently returned from a work tour of four countries in Europe and Italy was one of them. Italy has seen an alarming spread of infections  with at least 1 400 deaths. He became the fifth person from the national capital to be infected by the highly contagious disease. When the man landed at the airport and came in contact with several people  he was screened by a thermal sensor. After his temperature was reported to be normal  he proceeded to exit the facility. “He was travelling with six colleagues  and all of them have tested negative. He did not show any signs and was going about his regular chores till he caught fever ” a relative said. The infected man was in contact with his wife and two children at his Janakpuri house before he was diagnosed and isolated. His mother lived with his younger brother in a different house in the area. She would visit the 46-year-old frequently.  “All the family members have been tested negative. The house where he lived has been locked up. Everyone is scared. We have already lost one member ” another family member said. Data provided by the Directorate General of Health Services shows that between contracting the virus and its detection  the man was in touch with 813 people. Out of this  40 people are from Delhi and 773 from outside the city. The records also show that 14 people were in contact with man’s 68-year-old mother. According to another family member  who asked not to be named  the man used the Delhi Metro to reach his office in Noida and attended work till the first week of March. The distance between the Janakpuri West and Noida’s Botanical Garden stations is 38.5kms  with 25 stops. Specific details of the local travel could not be found. The man works at a private firm in Noida  which employs over 700 people.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/infected-delhi-man-came-in-contact-with-813-people/story-CBg5WkpuXhVgWNNfZ3lJKK.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;spain;italy;united states,Is India doing enough to check community spread?,In India  where medical expertise and infrastructure in often in short supply or under stress  many fear that such an event could inflict greater damage.,There may be no known cases of community transmission of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India yet  but with several infected people turning up for testing weeks after getting infected  experts believe it may be just a matter of time before people they interacted with test positive. Undetected community transmission is among the main reasons why the spread of the disease went out of hand in Italy  Spain  Iran  and even in parts of the United States  stretching health care infrastructure and leading to the loss of lives. In India  where medical expertise and infrastructure in often in short supply or under stress  many fear that such an event could inflict greater damage. So what is India doing to contain and control community transmission? The country’s apex biomedical research body  the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)  will begin its second batch of random testing of samples of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) for Covid-19 on Sunday at 51 of its viral research labs  to see if there is any evidence of community transmission of the viral disease in India. Since the day India reported its first case of the disease on January 30  which was the day the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak to be a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”  India has reported a total of 84 cases and two deaths. While the numbers are small  and India has taken measures to contain the spread of infection  the situation is not fully under control. “Since we are not into aggressive testing yet  lifting of random samples from its flu-like illness surveillance network is a good idea to check community transmission ” said a senior health expert  requesting anonymity. ICMR’s network of viral research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) across India are being utilised for the purpose. The first batch of testing was done with samples lifted between February 15 and 29 from 13 VRDLs  and tested for Covid-19 at its apex virology laboratory at National Institute of Virology in Pune. About 20 samples from each lab were randomly lifted of patients with febrile illnesses. “So far none of the samples have returned positive  suggesting no community transmission of Covid-19...we are lifting a select number of random samples that are doing surveillance work on influenza like illnesses ” said Dr Nivedita Gupta  a scientist at ICMR. “All throughout the year  these labs get samples for flu like illnesses so we decided to lift samples from there. If we find anything suggesting community transmission then our whole strategy will change towards disease management ” she added.  “A comprehensive package of measures is required for countries to prepare when there are no cases  sporadic cases  clusters of cases  community transmission  or countrywide transmission... ” WHO says. Lav Aggarwal  joint secretary in the Union health ministry  said the most effective way to break disease transmission is by staying under home quarantine for 14 days for asymptomatic people.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-india-doing-enough-to-check-community-spread/story-Yqjtj6pFZNnFxZVf8blqvK.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;china;spain;italy;pakistan;rwanda,India declares Covid-19 a disaster,Although the spread of Covid-19 in India has not been rapid so far  the disease has typically spiked in other countries about three weeks after the first clusters of infections were detected.,India on Saturday declared the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak a disaster  freeing up resources and funds to battle the spread of the infection that has sparked the shutdown of travel  schools and offices across the country  as two fresh cases took the total number of infections to 84 at a time when questions remain over the efficacy of containment efforts in the country. Although the spread of Covid-19 in India has not been rapid so far  the disease has typically spiked in other countries about three weeks after the first clusters of infections were detected. With the first surge in India reported in early March  the country enters what could be its most vulnerable phase over the course of the next week. About a dozen states are now in partial lockdown  but some experts say that if a more stringent pre-emptive lockdown is not enforced across the country  the public health system could crumble under the load of an exponential spike in the number of patients needing intensive care. On Saturday  the Union health ministry said two fresh cases – one each in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir – took the total confirmed infections to 84. “Out of 84 positive cases in the country  10 people have fully recovered and have been discharged. Contact tracing of these cases has led to the identification of over 4 000 contacts who have been put under surveillance ” said Sanjeeva Kumar  special secretary at the health ministry. The Centre also announced its decision to treat the coronavirus outbreak as a “notified disaster” for the purpose of providing assistance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The disaster management division of the home ministry issued a letter to the chief secretaries of all states. “The central government  keeping in view the spread of COVID-19 virus in India and the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)  by way of a special one-time dispensation  has decided to treat it as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under SDRF ” the notification said. While an initial statement said ex-gratia relief of ~4 lakh would be provided to the families of the dead  the government reissued a modified order later with no mention of the compensation amount.  The home ministry said the State Executive Committees “will decide the number of quarantine camps  their duration and the number of persons in such camps”. “Period can be extended by the committee beyond the prescribed limit subject to condition that expenditure on this account should not exceed 25% of SDRF allocation for the year ” the notification added.  The Centre said that funds can be withdrawn for setting up additional testing laboratories within the government set-up. The states will have to bear the cost of personal protection equipment for health care  municipal  police and fire services. The government also allowed the states to use SDRF money for procuring thermal scanners and other necessary equipment. The coronavirus infection  which is believed to have originated at a seafood market in China’s Wuhan in December last year  has so far spread to more than 100 countries  infected about 150 000 people and claimed at least 5 500 lives. While Wuhan took the biggest hit from the outbreak  WHO said on Friday that Europe had become the new epicentre of the public health crisis. With 1 500 new cases in 24 hours  Spain decided on Saturday to follow Italy in declaring a nationwide lockdown to slow the accelerating spread of the coronavirus epidemic. The decision came as European countries took ever more severe  though widely varying  measures to reduce contact between their citizens and slow the pandemic. China continued to ease lockdown measures in its hardest-hit region. Views of empty streets  shuttered shops and a heavy silence greeted Italians from their windows as the country spends its first weekend under lockdown in a bid to contain its coronavirus outbreak. Since Monday  the country  which has recorded over 21 000 infections and at least 1 400 deaths from the virus  has enacted a set of sweeping measures that have left millions virtually confined to their homes. Rwanda’s health ministry  meanwhile  said on Saturday that an Indian citizen tested positive -- the first case reported in the central African nation. Authorities said the man showed no symptoms when he arrived in Rwanda from Mumbai on March 8. It said that on March 13 the man checked himself into a health facility  where he was immediately tested  and is now in stable condition. Experts say aggressive and widespread testing in India could prove to be a make-or-break measure in stopping Covid-19 transmission from turning into an acute community transmission. There are plans to involve the private sector in diagnostics  quarantine and isolation of cases. Currently  the government testing infrastructure appears to be highly underutilised.  Over the past few days  Indian state authorities have ordered the closure of public buildings  cinemas and bars in several cities  and major sporting events have also been postponed. Several states have announced more limited restrictions  including the closure of some schools. On Saturday  Himachal Pradesh and Goa joined the list of states that have announced the curbs. In New Delhi  the health ministry official said seven people who tested positive  five from Uttar Pradesh and one each from Rajasthan and Delhi  have now been discharged after treatment. Delhi has reported seven positive cases and Uttar Pradesh 12 so far. Kerala has recorded 19 cases  including three patients who were discharged last month after they recovered from the highly contagious infection. The total confirmed cases include 17 foreigners – 16 Italian tourists and a Canadian  according to the government. At a news briefing on Saturday afternoon  Kumar said there have been cases of people not willing to be quarantined despite coming in contact with people testing positive.  A video conference of Saarc leaders to frame a strategy to counter the coronavirus crisis proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi  will also be held on Sunday evening. All seven other members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) endorsed the proposal made by Modi on Friday. Pakistan  the last member- state to agree  has said its de facto health minister will join the video conference.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-declares-covid-19-a-disaster/story-2djopgw8fCgFT2xve70SEN.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;china;italy;singapore,India needs a more aggressive testing regimen for coronavirus: Experts,India reported two deaths in the past week  and 84 confirmed infections  far lower than disease hot spots in China  Italy  Iran and South Korea. Medical authorities have  until Saturday  tested 6 700 samples.,Experts are calling for an aggressive ramping up of testing in India to stave off the deadly infection that has claimed at least 5 500 lives across the world  pointing out that the current capacity to screen people may prove to be inadequate in case of a sudden surge in infections. India has made arrangements to nearly double its capacity to test for the novel coronavirus and started random screening of samples  but in a country this large  the dangerous community transmission phase of the disease  when it spreads to people who have neither been to a global hot spot nor been in direct contact with someone testing positive  could have deadly ramifications. India reported two deaths in the past week  and 84 confirmed infections  far lower than disease hot spots in China  Italy  Iran and South Korea. Medical authorities have  until Saturday  tested 6 700 samples. India’s top medical body  the Indian Council for Medical Research  said it is ready for a sudden surge in cases  by adding to its network of laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19  and by procuring more testing reagents. “We have added the number of labs to about 65 and at this point we can perform 100 000 tests  effectively about 10 000 tests in a day. We have made further arrangements to procure reagents to be able to do about 200 000 more tests  if required ” said Dr Balram Bhargava  director general of the ICMR. However  at the moment  only those with a history of travel to 12 countries designated as high-risk  or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus  or showing symptoms of the disease  are being tested. Dr Lalit Kant  an expert in infectious diseases  said: “The South Korea model [of aggressive testing] is good  as it worked well. It can be tried in India also as because of the high population we may soon be expecting large numbers to test.” In South Korea  which is experiencing the largest outbreak of the epidemic outside mainland China where the virus originated late last year  authorities have enforced a unique and aggressive testing regimen. The country of 51 million people has devised rapid tests and told medical authorities to not deny screening to anyone  even if they are not citizens or residents. The administration worked with biotech firms to develop rapid tests and sanctioned local governments to test people at drive-through stations – where people pull up in cars and get tested for the virus.  Experts link these strategies with a fall in the number of new infections  and have now called for similar methods to be employed in the US  where authorities have drawn flak for slow rates of testing. Other countries such as Vietnam and Singapore have also followed the model of South Korea  which has tested the highest number of people per capita in the world. “Some countries have been very aggressive and have actually done quite a good job. Other countries have been quite lackadaisical and  I think  have suffered immensely from it... ” Ashish Jha  who runs the Harvard Global Health Institute  told NPR on Friday. India has been able to manage the infection until now  but some experts worry that in the next few weeks  the country will be at risk of a dramatic rise in numbers. “We need to look at all alternatives  even rapid tests to be able to manage the numbers in future ” said Kant. A second expert said on condition of anonymity that it was unclear if India was testing enough people. “But look at the country’s population  and the numbers that have tested positive  it appears to be we aren’t testing enough. One of the reasons could be not all contacts are being traced adequately and that could lead in sudden jump in numbers ” the expert said. ICMR said it was ready for the challenge. “We are adequately prepared; however  we have not yet reached a stage where we get more samples than we can test. As opposed to the capacity of performing 90 tests per day in all our laboratories  we are getting about 60-70 samples daily in all the labs put together ” Bhargava told HT. ICMR has also begun lifting random samples of influenza-like illnesses from its network of viral research and diagnostic laboratories across India  to see if there is transmission in community. The first batch of random samples (about 20 from each of its 13 labs) was tested between February 15 and 29. All the tests were negative for coronavirus. Another batch of sample lifting is to start on March 15.  A number of states have also enforced a partial shutdown of public places. Almost all visas have been suspended for a month  and the government has invoked the Epidemic Disease Act 1897  and Disaster Management Act  2005. “Invoking these acts does not mean there is COVID-19 epidemic... It means the government is working proactively...” said Lav Aggarwal  joint secretary of the health ministry. According to World Health Organization (WHO)  countries should test suspect cases  contacts of confirmed cases; test patients identified through respiratory disease surveillance  if there is local cluster transmission. A section of experts  however  disagree on the need for aggressive testing. “Only symptomatic people  especially those with a travel history or contact of a laboratory positive case  need to get tested as there is a risk of getting false negative results in the early stages of disease... ” said Dr Lalit Dar  professor of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-must-be-done-on-war-footing/story-4gI2HWQ2WLhVLFOm5rsioM.html

The collection of samples and screening of Indians began earlier in Iran as a six-member team of health officials was sent to that country last week in view of the pressure put on the Iranian infrastructure by the COVID-19 outbreak  the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Some 1 200 samples have been collected in Iran and the first two batches of 108 samples and 529 samples were brought back to India on March 7 and March 10 respectively by special flights. Those who tested negative in these batches were being brought back to the country  the people said. The Indian embassy in Italy tweeted photos on Saturday of a large number of Indian students wishing to return being tested for COVID-19  by a four-member medical team that reached Rome on Friday. An Air India flight sent to Italy on Saturday is expected to bring back some 250 people on Sunday. The missions in Iran and Italy are in touch with Indians and advising them on health protocols. They are also coordinating with stranded Indians to ensure their testing is done smoothly  the people said. The external affairs ministry has created a special cell led by additional secretary Dammu Ravi to coordinate Coronavirus response-related issues internally and externally. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla are also monitoring the situation. So far  the embassy in Beijing helped organise three special flights to Wuhan  the epicentre of the outbreak  that brought back 723 Indians and 43 foreigners belonging to seven countries in February. One of these flights also carried 15 tonnes of medical relief materials to Wuhan. The Indian embassy in Japan mounted an evacuation flight in February that brought back 119 Indians and five nationals of Sri Lanka  Nepal  South Africa and Peru who were quarantined on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.  So far  102 people have been evacuated on two flights organised by the mission in Tehran and another flight left India on Saturday to bring back more Indian students. Indian missions in the US are also coordinating the evacuation of Indians quarantined aboard the cruise ship Grand Princess  which is docked at Oakland.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-sent-to-bring-indians-from-coronavirus-affected-iran-italy/story-ivBgNIziwnh6qlX27RzccL.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,oman,Delhi’s first coronavirus patient recovers  will be monitored at home,The person  a 45-year-old businessman from Mayur Vihar in east Delhi  had thrown a birthday party for his son at a five-star hotel in Delhi before being isolated on March 1.,The first person to test positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Delhi was released on Saturday evening  officials of the Safdarjung Hospital said. The person  a 45-year-old businessman from Mayur Vihar in east Delhi  had thrown a birthday party for his son at a five-star hotel in Delhi before being isolated on March 1. “The man who was the first one to test positive of COVID-19 has been released today. He is totally asymptomatic now. We have asked him and his family to still continue monitoring his condition at home. Our teams will also do a follow-up ” said a top official from Safdarjung hospital. Delhi had six positive cases of coronavirus and on Saturday a seventh person was tested positive in the city.  “With the Mayur Vihar resident being released on Saturday and the death of the 68-year old woman on Friday  we now have four positive cases of COVID-19 who are residents of Delhi ” the official said. Hospital authorities said that the seventh positive case of coronavirus which emerged in the national Capital on Saturday is not a resident of Delhi.  “The person  the seventh case in the city  arrived at Delhi. he is actually from Rajasthan. He was sent to the Manesar facility and now has been shifted to Safdarjung ” said another official on condition of anonymity.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-first-coronavirus-patient-recovers-will-be-monitored-at-home/story-6X7yPUau9IYkzPvoQYp4HI.html
15/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,oman;india,Delay in Delhi corona victim’s last rites after confusion over procedure,The woman’s family alleged that while hospital authorities had advised “immediate cremation” of the body  after she died on Friday night  the body was only cremated at 12.30pm on Saturday.,For more than 14 hours after a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri succumbed to coronavirus (COVID-19) infection  her body was kept at the lawns of the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and then in the premises of the Nigambodh Ghat before it could finally be cremated.  The woman’s family alleged that while hospital authorities had advised “immediate cremation” of the body  after she died on Friday night  the body was only cremated at 12.30pm on Saturday. All this  because hospital authorities  municipal agencies and staff at the crematorium were not prepared to handle a coronavirus-infected body. A senior official in the Delhi government said no standard operating procedure (SOP) has been issued by the Central government to states on how to handle a COVID-19 infected dead body. “The director general of health services (DGHS) has asked us to handle an infected dead body the same way we treat a living COVID-19 patient ” said the official on the condition of anonymity.  “She died at night  and hospital authorities told us they will not keep the body there. Around 1am  her body was shifted from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to the ambulance. We were particularly asked by the doctors to either avail electric or CNG cremation facilities as the virus will remain active in the body even after death ” a relative of the woman said.  The relative said that from 1am  the ambulance carrying the body of the woman was parked in the lawns of the hospital  and it was quarantined using a rope tied around the vehicle to prevent any personal contact from patients and family members visiting the hospital. The ambulance was guarded by two guards wearing protective suits.  Around 10.30am  nearly 25 family members of the victim reached Nigambodh Ghat to cremate the body  which was accompanied by two hospital staff. However  they were stopped by crematorium staff.  “They told us that they will not conduct the cremation because it was a government facility and they did not have any order from the government on whether the body of an infected person can be cremated  or how to go about the procedure ” the relative said. He added  “We were asked to take the body to the Lodi Road facility  but even they refused to take the body.”  The woman’s body was finally cremated after a team from RML Hospital and the health department of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation arrived and took over the procedure. The body was handled by a team wearing personal protective equipment.  Ashok Rawat  health officer at the north corporation  said the officials were also taken aback when the body was brought into the crematorium on Saturday.  “Neither hospital authorities nor family members informed us that the dead body was being brought to Nigambodh Ghat. We will send a request letter to RML hospital asking them to inform us in advance if the body of a coronavirus-infected person is being brought to our facilities ” Rawat said.  The 68-year-old was the first to die of coronavirus infection in Delhi  and the second in India. The woman’s 46-year-old son had tested positive for the virus on Wednesday.  Experts were divided on the possibility of the virus spreading after the death of infected people.  Director  All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS)  Randeep Guleria said there is no risk in cremating the infected bodies.  “Coronavirus cannot spread through dead bodies. It spreads from respiratory secretion. Coughing is necessary for the spread of this virus ” he said. Dr Hagai Levine  professor of epidemiology with expertise in outbreak investigation  at the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health in Jerusalem  also agreed that the risk of transmission is next to nil after death. “The risk for droplet transmission from a dead body is extremely low ” Levine said.  The chief medical officer of Gautam Budh Nagar  Dr Anurag Bhargava  however  said quarantine should be followed even while performing last rites.

15/03/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;saudi arabia,Centre hikes duty on fuel; opposition calls it ‘anti-people’,The main opposition party  the Congress  predictably criticized the move  which is expected to result in additional revenue of more than ~40 000 crore to the government  as “anti-people” on the assumption that it would lead to an increase in prices at the pump.,The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by ~3 per litre on Saturday  adding to the windfall gains it stands to reap from a slump in global crude oil prices and giving itself room to stimulate a slowing economy that’s now bracing for fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.  The main opposition party  the Congress  predictably criticized the move  which is expected to result in additional revenue of more than ~40 000 crore to the government  as “anti-people” on the assumption that it would lead to an increase in prices at the pump. Instead  oil marketing companies cut the price of petrol by 13 paise per litre and that of diesel by 16 paise per litre  albeit a minute fraction of the increase in excise. A litre of petrol cost ~69.87 per litre and diesel ~62.58 per litre at the pump (ex-Delhi) on Saturday following the increase. A government official described the increase in excise duty on fuel  taxes on which make up one-third of retail prices  as a “measure of fiscal prudence”. Each additional rupee that comes to the exchequer by way of excise duty on petrol and diesel means an additional ~14 500 crore in revenue.  The hike would provide extra resource to fund infrastructure and other development projects at a time when government finances are tight  the official said on condition of anonymity. Effectively  central levies on petrol add up to ~22.98 per litre and on diesel to ~18.83 per litre after the increase. A slump in global crude oil prices on March 10  after a price war erupted between Saudi Arabia and Russia  resulted in a decline in the price of Indian basket of crude purchases to ~2 552.56 per barrel  a level close to what it was on December 16 2015  when petrol was selling at ~59.98 and diesel at ~46.09 per litre  HT reported on Thursday. According to the oil ministry’s data-keeper Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) the price of the Indian crude oil basket  which factors in the rupee-dollar exchange rate  extended the slump to ~2 396.78 on March 12. Experts said there was room to reduce petrol and diesel prices  but the opacity of retail fuel prices in India prevents consumers from reaping the full benefits of an international oil price slump. This is not the first time that the government has raised excise duty on fuels despite a steep decline in the price of crude  seeking to augment its revenues. To be sure  there have been instances in the past too of the government cutting excise duty to cushion the consumer when global prices surged  a second official said on condition of anonymity. The government is battling an economic downturn that is expected to lower growth in the 2019-20 fiscal year  which ends in March  to 6%  the lowest in 11 years  according to a forecast in the budget presented on February 1. “The global economic slowdown due to coronavirus has halted almost every sector and this hike in excise duty would help the government in generating revenue and resources for development of infrastructure” and so on  said Vishal Raheja  deputy general manager of tax research and consulting firm Taxmann. The Centre found it timely to raise additional money to make up for a shortfall in budgeted direct and indirect tax revenue because of the economic slowdown  the first official said.  “While the benefit of reduction of crude prices in the first quarter of this year has significantly gone to the consumer  the government has taken this step of increasing {excise} duty to raise some revenue in view a tight fiscal situation. This would help in generating the resources for development of infrastructure ” the official said. “Even with this increase in the duties  the prices of petrol and diesel would fall further on account of a significant fall in the crude price. It may be noted that the prices of petrol and diesel have already fallen by more than ~6 per ltre since the second week of January ” the official said. The global crude oil price  which was around $66 per barrel in January 2020  fell to about $51 a barrel in the first week of March. It crashed to about $32 this week. The Congress party plans to raise the issue both inside and outside Parliament to pressure the government to pass on the benefit of low international crude oil prices to the people. Congress Party national spokesperson Sanjay Jha wrote in a tweet  “Crude oil prices have collapsed  and consumer demand is low. But this callous government is taxing Indians by imposing excise duties on petrol and diesel?? Making merry in this depressing #Coronavirus environment?? This is a crude government. A rude government.” Vishal Raheja  deputy general manager of tax research and consulting firm Taxmann  said  “It is noteworthy that earlier benefit of rate reduction has been passed on to consumers but this time government has decided to not pass on the benefit and raise revenue in this tight fiscal deficit situation. The global economic slowdown due to corona virus has halted almost each sector and this hike in excise duty would help government in generating revenue and resources for development of infrastructure etc.” Economists praised the move . “This balance by the government is a good strategy. This also helps the state shore up some revenue for other useful expenditures ” said N.R. Bhanumurthy  economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.

15/03/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;saudi arabia,Centre hikes duty on fuel;  Oppn calls it ‘anti-people’,,NEW DELHI The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs.3 per litre on Saturday  adding to the windfall gains it stands to reap from a slump in global crude oil prices and giving itself room to stimulate a slowing economy that’s now bracing for fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.  The main opposition party  the Congress  predictably criticized the move. which is expected to result in additional revenue of more than Rs.40 000 crore to the government  as “anti-people” on the assumption that it would lead to an increase in prices at the pump. Instead  oil marketing companies cut the price of petrol by 13 paise per litre and that of diesel by 16 paise per litre  albeit a minute fraction of the increase in excise. A litre of petrol cost Rs 69.87 per litre and diesel Rs 62.58 per litre at the pump (ex-Delhi) on Saturday following the increase. A government official described the increase in excise duty on fuel  taxes on which make up one-third of retail prices  as a “measure of fiscal prudence.” Each additional rupee that comes to the exchequer by way of excise duty on petrol and diesel means an additional Rs.14 500 crore in revenue.  The hike would provide extra resource to fund infrastructure and other development projects at a time when government finances are tight  the official said on condition of anonymity. Effectively  central levies on petrol add up to Rs 22.98 per litre and on diesel to Rs 18.83 per litre after the increase. A slump in global crude oil prices on March 10  after a price war erupted between Saudi Arabia and Russia  resulted in a decline in the price of Indian basket of crude purchases to Rs.2 552.56 per barrel  a level close to what it was on December 16 2015  when petrol was selling at Rs.59.98 and diesel at Rs 46.09 per litre  HT reported on Thursday  According to the oil ministry’s data-keeper Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) the price of the Indian crude oil basket  which factors in the rupee-dollar exchange rate  extended the slump to Rs 2 396.78 on March 12. Experts said there was room to reduce petrol and diesel prices  but the opacity of retail fuel prices in India prevents consumers from reaping the full benefits of an international oil price slump. This is not the first time that the government has raised excise duty on fuels despite a steep decline in the price of crude  seeking to augment its revenues. To be sure  there have been instances in the past too of the government cutting excise duty to cushion the consumer when global prices surged  a second official said on condition of anonymity. The government is battling an economic downturn that is expected to lower growth in the 2019-20 fiscal year  which ends in March  to 6%  the lowest in 11 years  according to a forecast in the budget presented on February 1.

14/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,israel;india,Netanyahu requested PM Modi to allow export of raw medical supplies to Israel: Report,Netanyahu  however  did not share any specific details of his discussions with his Indian counterpart during the press conference.,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested  Narendra Modi to approve and allow the export of masks and pharmaceutical raw materials to Israel during his telephonic conversation with his Indian counterpart this week  according to a media report.  Israel’s Channel 13 on Friday reported that Netanyahu made the request after India decided to stop the export of these items to meet its own domestic requirements in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus. The leading news channel also put out a promotional tweet ahead of its broadcast during its main evening bullettin.  At a press conference on Wednesday  the Israeli Prime Minister had mentioned about reaching out to Modi  among other leaders  hinting at Israeli efforts to maintain and stabilise “supply lines” of essential materials in view of the massive disruption caused by COVID-19.  “I also spoke to the Prime Minister of India  my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time ” Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday evening.  His remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister  the economy and industry minister  the Bank of Israel’s governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus.  Netanyahu  however  did not share any specific details of his discussions with his Indian counterpart during the press conference.  Itamar Grotto  deputy director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry  said Modi agreed to allow the export of materials for medicines to Israel  but there was no decision yet on the masks.  “Special permission was given and the drug procurement is being carried out now. The Indians agreed to exempt Israel ” Grotto told Channel 13.  The report cited three unnamed Israeli officials as saying that Netanyahu asked Modi to lift the export ban on these items  which were imposed several weeks ago  as Israel imports most of the raw materials it needs for medicines from India.  The Israeli Health Ministry has requested its embassy in New Delhi to ask Indian officials to allow hundreds of thousands of protective masks to be sent to Israel due to a shortage in the country  the report said.  Netanyahu on Friday sought to reassure his countrymen that a series of restrictions imposed by the administration to try and stem the spread of coronavirus would not affect the food supply  saying there was “no reason to storm supermarkets”.  “We are investing considerable means right now to increase the pace of testing  to reduce the infection rate and – of course – to reinforce  strengthen and safeguard the medical teams  as well as many other things ” Netanyahu said.  “You have no reason to storm supermarkets. There will be enough food in general and for the (upcoming Passover) holiday ” he stressed.  Some Israelis have been stocking up on supplies  fearing extended periods of quarantine  lockdown orders  or shortages.  Some 35 000 Israelis are said to be in quarantine  almost 1 000 of them doctors and over 600 nurses. Three Israelis are said to be seriously ill with the virus  and almost 150 have tested positive. Nobody has died from coronavirus in Israel.  The deadly novel coronavirus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 5 000 lives and infected more than 134 000 people across 110 countries and territories  with the World Health Organisation (WHO) describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday.

14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,US House of Representatives passes Trump-backed coronavirus relief package,The 363-40 vote early Saturday sends the measure to the Senate  which plans to skip next week’s planned recess to take up the bill. The House is not planning to be in session next week.,The House passed an economic relief plan backed by President Donald Trump to deal with the spreading coronavirus as part of what lead negotiator Speaker Nancy Pelosi said will be a continuing effort to help the American people. The 363-40 vote early Saturday sends the measure to the Senate  which plans to skip next week’s planned recess to take up the bill. The House is not planning to be in session next week. “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” Trump wrote on Twitter Friday after two days of intense negotiations between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The president added  “Look forward to signing the final Bill  ASAP!“ The House package includes free testing for everyone who needs it  and two weeks of paid sick leave to allow people with the virus to stay home from work and avoid infecting co-workers. It also includes enhanced jobless benefits  increased food aid for children  senior citizens and food banks  and higher funding for Medicaid benefits. The growing outbreak is beginning to squeeze the U.S. economy as schools and sports leagues shut down and businesses scale back or require employees to work from home. Earlier Friday  Trump declared a national emergency that would free up as much as $50 billion to help states and cities respond to the health crisis  waive student-loan interest  purchase large quantities of oil and confer new authority on his health secretary to bypass hospital regulations. HOPE FOR INVESTORS Even though Pelosi said the bill is aimed at helping families  rather than providing broader fiscal stimulus  the bipartisan deal provides a bit of hope for investors who were looking for any indication that policymakers could work together to address the multifaceted crisis. Markets rallied during Trump’s news conference  unwinding almost 90% of the previous day’s historic rout. Pelosi said that while the Senate works on the House bill next week  her chamber’s leaders will begin working on an additional emergency response measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement shortly after Saturday’s vote that the Senate “will need to carefully review” the House measure. “But I believe the vast majority of senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers  families  and small businesses ” he said. As the crisis ballooned  the Federal Reserve was the first to act with last week’s rate cut and this week’s massive repo operations and expanded securities purchases to ease “temporary disruptions” in the market. There is pressure on the Fed’s Open Market Committee to slash interest rates to zero when it meets in Washington March 17-18. Last week Congress passed and Trump signed into law an emergency spending bill that made available about $8 billion to reimburse state and local governments for the cost of preparing for and fighting the virus  stockpile medical supplies and purchase tests  vaccines and therapies to ensure that the poor have access. It also permits Medicare to spend $500 million on telehealth programs for the virus. ROILING MARKETS With infections multiplying and no vaccine immediately available  Pelosi pushed ahead with a Democrats-only plan earlier this week when the Trump administration didn’t deliver a promised proposal to respond to the economic consequences of the outbreak. In addition  Trump’s error-filled Oval Office address Wednesday failed to calm roiling equity markets. “We could have passed our bill yesterday ” Pelosi told reporters Friday night. “But we thought it would be important to show the American people  to assure the American people  that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.” “It was really important for us to have a bill right now because the challenge was there ” Pelosi said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  who waited to comment on the plan until after Trump announced his endorsement  called the agreement “a really good sign that shows bipartisanship.” It shows we can “beat this virus ” he said. The bill takes a number of steps to ensure expansive availability of free testing for the virus in the U.S.  including providing $1 billion for testing and diagnostics services for people who don’t have health coverage. A number of provisions are geared toward low-income families and individuals by providing additional funding for food banks and recipients of food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs. It allow states to give lower-income parents direct payments to pay for food their children won’t be getting through free or reduced-price meals at their schools. The bill would provide $1 billion in emergency grants to states to help them administer unemployment benefits  with half of the funds targeted to states with the worst spikes in joblessness. SICK LEAVE One of the biggest sticking points in the negotiations was over provisions requiring employers to provide paid sick leave. Workers will get up to two weeks of paid sick leave to deal with coronavirus issues and another 10 weeks of coronavirus-related paid family leave at two-thirds pay in the bill  with the government reimbursing businesses for the cost via new  temporary tax credits. Smaller companies could get exemptions from the paid family leave after the first two weeks of sick leave provided doing so would risk closing their businesses - a provision sought by McCarthy. More than a quarter of private U.S. workers don’t have paid medical leave  including more than half of part-time workers and about 40% of service employees.U.S. lawmakers don’t know how much the House bill  H.R. 6201  will cost  and Democrats said they didn’t plan to wait for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before voting. The revised bill also boosts the federal match for Medicaid by 6.2 percentage points  less than the 8 percent in Pelosi’s original bill but still something that will give states potentially tens of billions in additional funding if the coronavirus crisis extends for months. The bill also sunsets at the end of the year - another win for Republicans who did not want to create a new  permanent sick leave requirement for employers. The deal at times appeared teetering on the brink. As he announced a national emergency  Trump cast doubt on on the plan  telling reporters at the White House that Democrats weren’t giving enough in the negotiations. The House proposal set aside Trump’s call for a long holiday from the payroll tax that funds Social Security  which faces bipartisan skepticism. Some Republicans said they could address that issue later. The Capitol was closed to the public Friday in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Several members of Congress closed their Washington offices because of a staff member’s infection or exposure to the virus  and staff are working from their homes.

However  it was unclear if Trump or the Republican leadership in the Senate were behind the proposal  though a Pelosi aide said the House speaker had spoken to Mnuchin repeatedly over the past days. The fear surrounding the pandemic has pushed Wall Street indices into a bear market  which efforts to contain its spread shut down Disneyland and Broadway  and led major sports leagues to cancel or postpone their seasons  but Mnuchin called the slowdown a “short-term issue.” The president is committed to getting a “major stimulus package” through Congress  Mnuchin told CNBC early Friday  but he did not provide specifics. Options include a payroll tax cut and other ways to provide funds for people who cannot work because of the virus. “There’s no question there’s a short-term economic issue  but we will get through this.” Pelosi said the Democratic bill will focus on “testing  testing  testing” in addition to paid sick leave and expanding unemployment benefits. The announcements came one day after the Dow had its worst session since 1987  diving 10 percent in Thursday trading even as the US Federal Reserve moved to inject $1.5 trillion of cash into markets this week and broadened its purchases of US Treasury debt -- both moves reminiscent of the global financial crisis in 2008. Uncertainty over the stimulus package and sharp partisan rhetoric were exacerbating factors in Thursday’s declines  where selling was also spurred by Trump’s shock travel ban on Europe and the near-constant stream of event cancelations. DIMMING CONFIDENCE Mnuchin vowed said once the virus is overcome “the economy will be stronger than ever.” He also encouraged people to buy stocks  rejected the need to close markets and said he would be willing to fly commercial airlines.  “Not everybody who has sniffles will have the coronavirus ” Mnuchin said. The Dow had regained about 2.5 percent in afternoon trading Friday  retreating from the surge seen at the open. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut last week  and on Wednesday is expected to lower the benchmark borrowing rate again  possible cutting all the way to zero. The University of Michigan’s monthly consumer sentiment survey showed Americans are worried by the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The report’s chief economist Richard Curtin said while “the pandemic is widely regarded as a temporary event ” the economy needs immediate relief in the form of “multiple sources of cash transfers and debt forbearance.”  “To avoid a recession  speed is more essential than targeting.” Since breaking out in China  the COVID-19 virus has killed more than 5 000 people as of Friday and spread globally with cases topping 134 000  according to an AFP tally. Health authorities have warned that the outbreak is already well-entrenched in the US: the state of Ohio likely has more than 100 000 people carrying the virus  its health department said Friday. Meanwhile at least six US states have ordered schools to close as confirmed infections in the country climbed to more than 1 660 people.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-ready-stimulus-as-mnuchin-says-virus-hit-on-us-economy-short-term/story-wZMjed3gHvqc5Gc0rAoCqN.html
14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;oman;united states,US summons Chinese envoy over Beijing’s coronavirus comments,David Stillwell  the top US diplomat for East Asia  delivered a very “stern representation” to China’s ambassador Cui Tiankai  a State Department official said  adding that Beijing’s envoy was “very defensive.”,The US State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the US military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan  as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified. David Stillwell  the top US diplomat for East Asia  delivered a very “stern representation” to China’s ambassador Cui Tiankai  a State Department official said  adding that Beijing’s envoy was “very defensive.” The State Department official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in “starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.” “Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won’t tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.” Defence Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that “the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming US service members. #ChinaPropaganda” The virus  also called COVID-19  has infected 138 000 people worldwide and killed more than 5 000. China’s embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Despite the signs of tension  US President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its “data sharing”.  Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about “odd narratives” being offered by some Chinese officials  Trump appeared to brush off any concern  saying he had read one article on the subject  but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump  who in a national address this week called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China  added: “They know where it came from  we all know where it came from.”  Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday. “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted in English. The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing  whose already strained ties over issues including trade  intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak. The coronavirus  which emerged in China in December  has spread around the world  pummelling financial markets  halting industry  bringing some flights to a standstill  closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts. Zhao’s comments came days after Robert O’Brien  the US national security adviser  said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus  probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak  which the World Health Organization this week labelled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127 000 people worldwide  including nearly 81 000 in mainland China  and killed more than 5 000 people. Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January  it has imposed draconian containment measures  effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province  home to 60 million people.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the US response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing. He and several other US politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the “Wuhan virus.” In a national address on Wednesday  Trump called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-summons-chinese-envoy-over-beijing-s-coronavirus-comments/story-2E2OuF2Kp1woBHUu1uQx6H.html

Requesting everybody to don’t go to crowded places and put a mask or handkerchief on mouth.”  “As the message was put in the group without verification of facts  it created panic. Therefore  the complainant demanded action against the group member and its admin ” the official of Sangamner Police Station said. “Accordingly  the city police called both the women and gave a stern warning to them asking them not to indulge in spreading such rumours ” he said adding that both of them were allowed to go home later.

14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,united states;china;jersey;mexico,Trump emergency releases $50 bn in funds to fight coronavirus in US,36 Democratic senators urged him to draw on the US President to deal with the coronavirus outbreak which has caused over 2 000 infections and 47 deaths in the United States.,President Donald Trump’s declaration on Friday that the coronavirus outbreak is a “national emergency” allows billions of federal dollars and resources to be funneled to hard-hit US states. NATIONAL EMERGENCY In declaring that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency  Trump invoked the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act was passed by Congress in 1988 to provide federal assistance to state and local governments in order to “save lives and to protect property and public health and safety.” The Stafford Act can also be called upon to provide federal aid to states and local governments to help them respond to “major disasters” such as hurricanes  earthquakes  landslides  flooding  tsunamis or fires. “Only the Federal Government can provide the necessary coordination to address a pandemic of this national size and scope caused by a pathogen introduced into our country ” Trump said in a letter to department chiefs informing them that he was invoking the Stafford Act. In a proclamation  Trump also cited sections of the National Emergencies Act (NEA) to expand the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal with the crisis.   The NEA gives the White House sweeping powers to declare martial law  suspend civil liberties  expand the military  seize property and restrict trade  communications and financial transactions. FEMA The Stafford Act gives the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  part of the Department of Homeland Security  the authority to tap into a disaster relief fund. The FEMA fund had $42.6 billion at the end of February but Trump said at a press conference that “up to $50 billion” would be made available.  In a letter to the president on Wednesday  36 Democratic senators urged him to draw on the fund to deal with the coronavirus outbreak which has caused over 2 000 infections and 47 deaths in the United States. “State and local officials are working hard to mitigate the outbreak and protect Americans and ongoing federal resources are badly needed to support those efforts ” they said. The funds can be used for a variety of purposes including testing  diagnosis  treatment and monitoring  medical equipment and temporary shelter such as tents or portable buildings. The federal authorities would assume 75 percent of the cost while the states contribute the remaining 25 percent. PRECEDENTS President Bill Clinton issued a declaration of emergency under the Stafford Act in 2000 to assist the states of New York and New Jersey in fighting an outbreak of West Nile virus. President Barack Obama invoked the National Emergencies Act to respond to an outbreak of H1N1 swine flu in 2009 and president George W. Bush invoked it after 9/11. Trump invoked the NEA in February of last year to obtain funding refused by Congress for his US-Mexico border wall. Trump has used the Stafford Act previously to deal with devastating wildfires in California and flooding in the Midwest. Trump later threatened to cut off FEMA funding for California unless the state’s forest management authorities “get their act together ” a threat which was widely condemned and one that was never carried out. OTHER MEASURES The Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on January 31 which allowed the federal government to take measures to stem the outbreak. The move allowed Trump to impose a ban on visitors from China  Iran and mainland Europe and to place persons suspected of having contracted the coronavirus in quarantine. Trump said Friday that he was considering extending the travel ban to visitors from Britain. The governors of 33 of the 50 American states have already declared states of emergency because of coronavirus  giving them the power to take such steps as closing schools or banning public gatherings.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-emergency-releases-50-bn-in-funds-to-fight-coronavirus-in-us/story-oVqOCgb430MFc4tqIC0veM.html
14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;hong kong,China talks science but floats conspiracy theory on coronavirus origin,Late on Thursday night  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had tweeted to his large number of followers that the US military might be behind the covid-19 epidemic.,A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Friday refueled his allegation that the novel coronavirus has US military origins by citing a story from a website known to promote conspiracy theories to bolster his claim. Late on Thursday night  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had tweeted to his large number of followers that the US military might be behind the covid-19 epidemic  and China  where it was first detected last year  wasn’t the origin of the virus. The covid-19 pandemic has gone to kill over 4000 and infect more than 1.32 lakh globally. “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation ” Zhao had tweeted in English and Chinese. 2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 Zhao did not offer any evidence but referred to statement by a top US health official that a few flu-related deaths in the US that occurred earlier could have been caused by the coronavirus. 1/2 CDC Director Robert Redfield admitted some Americans who seemingly died from influenza were tested positive for novel #coronavirus in the posthumous diagnosis  during the House Oversight Committee Wednesday. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 On Friday  he doubled down on his claim by referring to a similar story from the Montreal-based Centre for Research on Globalisation  which says it’s an independent think-tank but is often called out for peddling outlandish theories including on 9/11. Sharing a link from the website  Zhao tweeted on Friday that “…this article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. covid-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US.” It led to a bit of a firestorm on Twitter with thousands sharing Zhao’s tweets and many trashing it  saying China was on the aggressive to help it cover up the fact had officials had covered-up information on the covid-19 in December and for nearly three weeks in January. The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP)  in fact  reported on Friday  citing government documents that the first case of the infection was detected at the epicentre Wuhan in November. The SCMP report said Chinese health authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year. They were put under medical surveillance  and the earliest case was November 17 – weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus  and then finally put in place containment measures. At the regular foreign ministry press conference  Zhao’s colleague  spokesperson Geng Shuang somewhat sidestepped questions on whether Beijing blames the US for the coronavirus. “The international community including the US has different opinions about the origin of the virus ” said Geng. “The origin of the virus is a scientific matter and as such scientific views should be listened to ” said Geng.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-talks-science-but-floats-conspiracy-theory-on-coronavirus-origin/story-KSogX5yXGvCSGrMPNfWzDO.html
14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;saudi arabia,Coronavirus epidemic: Delhi hotels  travel companies report 70% dip in business,,New Delhi: The novel coronavirus epidemic has hit the tourism and hospitality industry hard in the national capital with experts and owners of both budget and luxury hotels and travel companies reporting a massive 70% dip in the business.   The Union health ministry on Friday confirmed 81 positive cases of coronavirus in India  out of which 64 are Indian citizens  16 Italians and 1 Canadian national. Globally  the disease has affected 137 385 people with 5 088 dead. India reported the first death due to the disease on Thursday with a 76-year-old  who had returned from Saudi Arabia  dying in Karnataka.  The central government has cancelled all the existing visas – except diplomatic  official  international organisations  employment -- till April 15 and has also advised the citizens to avoid travelling unless it is very essential.    “The tourism sector was already bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown and now the coronavirus epidemic has made things worse. Till February  the business was okay but after the corona threat nearly 70% business is affected as the occupancy at hotels across the city has drastically gone down after cancellation of bookings ” said Ajay Kumar Agarwal  president  Delhi Hotel Mahasangh.  According to industry experts  Delhi gets its maximum tourists between October and April. Tourists  mostly foreigners  come to Delhi not only to visit the city but also due to its close proximity to popular tourist hotspots such as Agra  Mathura  Rishikesh  Haridwar  Nainital  Dehradun  Ajmer and Jaipur. Many hotels are now offering huge discounts to attract local tourists and manage the loss. Speaking on the condition of anonymity  a senior management staff at Taurus Sarovar Portico Hotel at Mahipalpur said occupancy at the hotel is down by 70%. “The maximum number of group bookings has been cancelled for the March and April. We do not have a single booking for April so we have reduced rates by around 40% for current and advance booking in these months ” he said. At Radisson Blu in Mahipalpur  one of the staff member said that the business was low due to cancellation of bookings of tourists and official conferences. “The hotel occupancy has reduced by 50% otherwise it remains full. Rates have been slashed down by around 40% ” the staff said requesting anonymity. In the Aerocity  management staff at Novotel  Aloft hotels admitted that the occupancy has gone down and rates has been slashed by about 30% to 40%. The travel agencies are also having a tough time as their business too has gone down by about 70% due to coronavirus scare. “Over 70% of the major bookings have been cancelled due to coronavirus. The industry is suffering because not only the foreign tourists but local visitors have also postponed their plans. It will take a few months for the industry to revive and we can now pin hopes on the next tourist season starting in October ” said Vishesh Pradhan of Vaishnav Tours and Travels. Shambhu Dhayal of SK Travels said tourists come to Delhi and from here they hire cabs and mini buses to visit nearby tourist hubs such as Rishikesh  Agra  Ajmer  Nainital. “We do brisk business between January and March but this year  the season did not go well due to corona virus outbreak. Over 75% bookings have been cancelled ” Dayal said. The government however  has not yet assessed the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the tourism industry but the authorities admitted that it will have “a significant” effect on the industry.  Meenakshi Sharma  director general (tourism) at Union ministry of tourism  said it had been only a few weeks since corona outbreak so it was too early to assess the overall impact on the tourism sector. “We are collating the data. Last year  11 million foreign tourists visited India. The corona virus certainly has affected the industry as the visas of all the foreign tourists has been cancelled till April 15 but our primary concern is the safety of the travellers and local industry operators ” she said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-epidemic-delhi-hotels-travel-companies-report-70-dip-in-business/story-9JjoIB2cPNqlv2XBKH2qjI.html
14/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,India asks international airlines to waive cancellation fees due to covid-19 outbreak,Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO)  in a letter to civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola  sought a relief package from the government to stem losses caused to the aviation sector.,India’s aviation regulator  the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)  on Friday asked international airlines operating to and from India to waive cancellation and rescheduling charges in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.Private Indian airports  meanwhile  sought to levy a  surcharge on airline fares to cover losses stemming from the outbreak. “In view of the unfolding severe impact of Covid- 19  the aviation Industry is facing serious challenges. Flights are being curtailed  cancelled and disrupted almost on a daily basis. Resultantly  the passengers are also facing the brunt ” a circular issued by the DGCA said. “Their travel plans are also getting hit and disturbed. In the current scenario  it would be appropriate if airlines support their passengers in this tough time by waiving off cancellation/ reschedule charges or by providing other incentive. In light of the hardship faced by passengers  airlines may like to consider and take an appropriate call  accordingly ” the circular said. The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO)  in a letter written on Friday to civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola  sought a relief package from the government to stem losses caused to the aviation sector by a decline in airline bookings and aircraft occupancy. “To address the growing severity of this issue and ensure sustainability of operations for airport operators  we propose; defining a close cooperation mechanism between airport operators and policy stakeholders to identify various options to tackle the crisis  allowing levying of a nominal passenger facilitation charge as part of airline fares to cover increased operating expenses being incurred by the operators  and provisioning of an airport operator alleviation package by Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) to facilitate the growing operational expenses  released in the next control period of applicable airport operators ” the letter read. The government on Wednesday suspended almost all visas to India  as Covid-19 cases in the country sharply spiked and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. Fresh bookings and occupancy in domestic flights have dropped by 15-20% in the wake of the outbreak. A total of 16 foreign airlines have cancelled 492 international flights to India so far due to the novel coronavirus outbreak  Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri informed Parliament on Thursday. Domestic carriers have also taken a hit  as 93 flights have been cancelled per week by Vistara  SpiceJet  IndiGo and GoAir. According to estimates by ACI World  an organisation that represents the world’s airports  the Asia-Pacific is suffering the maximum impact of the coronavirus  with passenger traffic down by 24% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to what had been forecast for the period.  “Against this gloomy background of sharp declines in traffic and passenger throughput  airports’ aeronautical revenues and non-aeronautical revenues are rendering similar declines. The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecasts 2019-2040 projects revenue loss owing to Covid-19 to the tunes of US $3 billion ” the letter said. India’s travel and tourism industry is staring at a loss of around Rs 8 500 crore  according to the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO)  which has appealed to the government to review the travel ban after 10 days  waive  the Goods and Services Tax on the sector for one month or reduce the rate for the next financial year.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-international-airlines-waive-cancellation-fee/story-FJZYIKUVJoLPejs68RLnaI.html

Trump also criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  one of the U.S. organizations leading the fight against the deadly infection  for having a testing system that he said would “always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic.” Trump did not elaborate on why the system was inadequate  but on Thursday  the top U.S. official on infectious diseases  Anthony Fauci  said people cannot get tests easily and the U.S. testing system “is not really geared to what we need right now.” U.S. officials and lawmakers are struggling to get a sense of how many people in the country have contracted the virus  which they attribute to low testing rates.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-to-happen-soon-on-large-scale-basis-donald-trump/story-gHtSo3PIhMmOufurgckLrJ.html

Mamata Banerjee’s move drew sharp criticism from the opposition parties in the state  who alleged it was irresponsible of her to continue with the event under the changed circumstances. Banerjee came to the Netaji Indoor Stadium with a copy of the Centre’s advisory and read it out. “The Union government has asked to ensure that no public gathering  including for sporting events  takes place. There are restrictions on organising events. We have gathered despite that because such days do not come regularly ” she said after that.  The event was held to confer sports awards and felicitation of West Bengal’s prominent sports personalities by the state government  apart from distribution of grants to about 26 000 sports clubs across the towns and villages of Bengal. Nearly 10 000 people were present at the venue  according to an officer of the state’s sports and youth affairs department. The stadium has a capacity of 12 000 seats.

Replace handshake with namaskar and maintain distance with any person you are interacting with ” she said.  She also ordered that the grants would be sent to the clubs through the police. “Club representatives do not need to stand in queues ” she said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress leaders in the state criticised her decision of not cancelling or postponing the event. “This is grossly irresponsible for a chief minister to continue with the event and  above all  herself attending it. The event could have easily been postponed. But she did not want to lose out of any mileage out of the government grant to clubs  especially ahead of the statewide civic polls ” BJP’s state unit general secretary Sayantan Basu said. “She could have arranged for sending the grants to the clubs  without inviting so many people here. However  it seems she is beyond every rule or norm ” said veteran Congress legislator Manoj Chakraborty.

Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei index nosedived more than seven percent shortly after the open  with markets around the region plummeting after a historically bad trading day in the US and Europe. The Nikkei 225 index dropped 7.12 percent or 1 322.15 points to 17 237.48 in early trade  while the broader Topix index fell 6.31 percent or 83.73 points to 1 244.15. Australia’s ASX was down 7.3 percent and New Zealand’s benchmark NZX 50 slumped 7.9 percent. Trading was briefly halted on South Korea’s stock exchange when the benchmark KOSPI index fell 6.8 percent. The falls came after dramatic scenes on other global markets  with the Dow losing 10 percent  or around 2 350 points  to 21 200.62  in its worst session since 1987. London also had its worst day since the 1987 crash and Frankfurt its blackest day since 1989  the year the Berlin Wall fell. Paris suffered its worst one-day loss ever. Analysts said President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ban on travel to the US from Europe deeply rattled investors  and measures intended to shore up business and markets were proving insufficient. “The turmoil in markets has moved up another notch over the past 24 hours with President Trump’s European travel ban and underwhelming stimulatory measures adding more fuel to the fire of uncertainty  instead of providing a dose of reassurance ” wrote National Australia Bank’s senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril. “New containment measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 have increased the prospect of a severe global economic growth downturn ” he added. - ‘Full-blown global recession’ - The spread of the virus  now deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization  has sparked unprecedented measures around the world. Italy is effectively closed for business  while many countries have urged schools and businesses to shut down. The travel industry has suffered a body blow as new restrictions prompt mass cancellations  while sporting events have been scrapped and everything from museums to Disney theme parks have shut their doors. The crisis has raised fears of a global recession  with significant uncertainty about how bad the economic fallout might become. “In mere weeks  the market has shifted gears from a transitory health scare to a full-blown global recession ” wrote Stephen Innes  chief market strategist at AxiCorp. “Global supply chains are no longer just ‘disrupted’ but are now in the process of shutting down completely ” he added. “And even more worrisome is that the worst-case scenario and the sum of all fears are culminating with the view that policymakers remain well behind the curve.” The markets have also been shaken by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia  compounded by fears that travel restrictions will further dampen energy demand.  In early Asian trade  West Texas Intermediate was down 0.5 percent at $31 a barrel while Brent crude slipped 0.3 percent to $33 a barrel. On the currency markets  the dollar fetched 105.02 yen in early Asian trade  against 104.79 yen in New York on Thursday.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/asian-stocks-nosedive-extending-global-rout-on-recession-fears/story-QxQFlgqTxUKMsavTvHPcpN.html
13/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;united states,WHO: Don’t expect travel bans  ‘Mother Nature’ to beat coronavirus,Aylward also sought to dispel some myths and misconceptions about the virus. He said people shouldn’t worry about goods shipped from places.,Countries may gain time in the short-term as they limit travel to fight the new coronavirus pandemic  but the World Health Organization thinks overall that “it doesn’t help to restrict movement ” a top adviser to the U.N. health agency’s chief said Thursday. Dr. Bruce Aylward  who led a WHO team in China during the raging COVID-19 outbreak there last month  said in an interview that travel bans “generally aren’t part of the armamentarium you bring to bear on something like this.” “What we found  as a general principle - not a general principle  a pretty robust principle - is that it doesn’t help to to restrict movement ” Aylward  a former WHO emergencies chief  said outside a room at agency headquarters devoted to the outbreak. “What you’re really interested in is: Where is the virus? The viruses in the cases  the viruses in their close contacts.” Aylward spoke a day after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the worldwide spread of the virus now qualified as a pandemic and President Donald Trump announced temporary entry bans on travelers from most of Europe. Other countries also stepped up cross-border restrictions. He acknowledged that “people are confused” about the virus. He advised frequent hand-washing and other sanitary practices to avoid infection and getting tested quickly when someone suspects they’ve been exposed to the virus. Aylward also sought to dispel some myths and misconceptions about the virus. He said people shouldn’t worry about goods shipped from places with significant case numbers and remember that “sniffles” aren’t a symptom of COVID-19 but a high fever and dry cough are. He alluded to comments by some that warmer weather might snuff out the virus. “Many people ask  ‘Will this go away with the winter season?’” he said  noting that the epidemiological approach calls for locating and tracking the virus  and getting infected people out of circulation.. “I would not be betting on Mother Nature here ” Aylward said. “I would be betting on case-finding. Isolation (of patients). Contact tracing. Testing. Testing. Testing.” For most people  the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms  such as fever and cough. For some  especially older adults and people with existing health problems  it can cause more severe illness  including pneumonia. The vast majority who become infected recover. The World Health Organization says people with mild illness recover in about two weeks  while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. While the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions are considered most at risk  “people 30  40  50-years-old get sick with COVID ” Aylward said. “Most of them will recover and be fine. Some of them won’t. And some of them even will die.” “We don’t know who. And we don’t know why ” he said. “That’s very unsettling.” Aylward said he had “phenomenal confidence in the ability of the U.S. to get this under control ” noting how many epidemiologists in China — which has succeeded in minimizing new cases — had trained in the United States. “They know how to do this stuff ” he said of the U.S. experts. “And they’ve trained thousands of people across the U.S. to get organized. You mobilize that army  and you beat this most recent of enemies.” ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Marinakis  52  met a number of Arsenal’s players and staff when the Gunners faced Olympiakos in a Europa League tie in February. “Our London Colney training centre has been closed after head coach Mikel Arteta received a positive Covid-19 result this evening ” the Arsenal statement said. “Arsenal personnel who had recent close contact with Mikel will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines.  “We expect this to be a significant number of people from Colney  including the full first-team squad and coaching staff.” Arsenal are now trying to trace any other people who may have had contact with Arteta. - Premier League emergency - Arsenal managing director Vinai Venkatesham added: “The health of our people and the wider public is our priority and that is where our focus is. “Our thoughts are with Mikel who is disappointed but in good spirits. We are in active dialogue with all the relevant people to manage this situation appropriately  and we look forward to getting back to training and playing as soon as medical advice allows.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that the government was considering cancelling sporting events in the United Kingdom  but was not ready to do so yet. But the news of Arteta’s positive test could force the Premier League to cancel English top-flight matches. “In light of Arsenal’s announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19  the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures ” the Premier League said. Arsenal are the latest Premier League club to be hit by the virus. Leicester revealed on Thursday that three of their players have self-isolated after showing signs of the virus. Manchester City said one unnamed member of their squad  reportedly France defender Benjamin Mendy  is in self-isolation after a family member suffered a respiratory illness. The relative is being treated in hospital and has undergone tests for the coronavirus  which can cause shortness of breath. Chelsea reportedly cancelled training on Thursday after a member of staff showed signs of the illness. smg/nr,https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/arsenal-manager-arteta-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-Gko9q433pBIBX1hzs2JvLP.html

12/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,RBI prepared to deal with coronavirus impact on economy  markets,RBI also announced measures to provide US dollar liquidity to the Indian market that crashed to 74.34 mark against the US dollar on Thursday.,The Reserve Bank of India said on Thursday it was prepared to take all necessary measures to ward off the impact of coronavirus on the Indian economy  financial institutions and markets and added that it had adequate forex reserves to meet any emergency situation.  RBI also announced measures to provide US dollar liquidity to the Indian market that crashed to 74.34 mark against the US dollar on Thursday. Indian markets along with their global counterparts have been battered by the impact of coronavirus that has led to several sanctions impacting economic activity and sparking fears of an uncertain future. RBI said its forex reserves stood at $487.24 billion and it was well placed to meet any exigency. Another RBI release said that the forex reserves had increased during April-December 2019. The central bank added that it was “closely and continuously” monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and spillovers. In one of the worst performances in recent years  the Sensex tanked by nearly 3 000 points on Thursday on the back of a global selloff after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. US decision to suspend travel from Europe also contributed to the decline. The rupee at 74.34 against the US dollar was close to its all-time low of 74.48 seen in October 2018. RBI said the emerging market currencies were experiencing downside pressures partly due to “flight to safety” which had to a spike in volatility across all asset classes. “Mismatches in US dollar liquidity have become accentuated across the world. On a review of current financial market conditions and taking into consideration the requirement of US Dollars in the market  it has been decided to undertake 6-month US Dollar sell/buy swaps to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market ” RBI said on Thursday.  The swaps  RBI said  will be conducted through the auction route in multiple tranches and the auctions will be multiple price based  meaning  successful bids will be accepted at their respective quoted premiums. The auction date has been set for March 16 between 9:30 am to 11 am and the swap amount will be USD 2 Billion.

12/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;australia,Indian-origin researchers use apps  AI to help tackle coronavirus scare,Globally  health tech startups with medical chatbots are scrambling to update their algorithms to screen people and advise whether they should be evaluated for the novel coronavirus infection.,Apps powered by artificial intelligence are helping people screen themselves for the coronavirus  reducing the pressure on healthcare institutions and warning those at high risk of developing the infection across the world and also in India. Two Indian-origin researchers  one in Australia and the other in the US  have led their teams to develop coronavirus-specific risk checker apps to counter the fear and confusion surrounding the infection  declared a pandemic by the WHO. While Abhi Bhatia  CEO and co-founder of Medius Health  an AI digital health company in Australia  launched his platform on March 4  Arni S R Srinivasa Rao from Augusta University in the US and his team will be doing so soon. The apps can be used to reach someone really early on  educate the public  deliver accurate information relevant to their symptoms and quell the fears of people. Globally  health tech startups with medical chatbots are scrambling to update their algorithms to screen people and advise whether they should be evaluated for the infection. But apps that enable at-home risk assessments in just about a minute are making an entry in India too. Individuals have to fill in a detailed questionnaire and AI then uses an algorithm to rapidly assess their information  send a risk assessment -- no risk  minimal risk  moderate or high risk -- and alert the nearest facility that a health check is likely needed. The biggest problem with epidemics in general is the massive supply and demand mismatch  noted Bhatia. A huge demand for healthcare institutions and not enough to cater to it.  The inappropriate fear of the general public puts a lot of unnecessary burden on institutions that are already battling a crisis of inadequate healthcare and infrastructure  Bhatia told PTI. The Sydney-based Medius Health  he said  developed Quro -- a risk assessment tool for COVID-19  which has so far infected over 70 people in India. "The do-it-yourself web app tool presents the user with questions related to prevalent symptoms and risk factors in accordance with WHO protocols and guidelines " Bhatia said over the phone. The tool helps to understand the patient's symptoms and determine the coronavirus risk  thereby educating the public on the virus and collecting data for healthcare officials for early intervention  he said.  "Given the size of the populace in India and the sudden outbreak of the coronavirus  we received more than 4 000 hits within 24 hours of rolling out the tool in India. The number is only increasing as people in India use Quro to assess their risk indicator out of concern for health and panic " Bhatia said. "Our AI system is also continuously collating this data to help the Health ministry understand the magnitude of fear amongst people as well as steer potential high risk cases towards early detection and timely medical intervention to prevent it from spreading further " he added.  There were 64 843 hits on the risk assessment app till Thursday. From India  there were 28 700 hits. The number of risk assessments is growing at 32 per cent daily. Rao  from the Augusta University  and his team said their app can help direct those deemed at risk to the nearest definitive testing facility. The soon-to-be-launched app will help provide local and public health officials with real time information on emerging demographics of those most at risk for the infection so they can better target prevention and treatment initiatives  according to a study published in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology. "We wanted to help identify people who are at high risk for coronavirus  help expedite their access to screening and to medical care and reduce spread of this infectious disease " said Rao. The app asks individuals where they live as well as other details like gender  age and race  in addition to recent contact with an individual known to have coronavirus. It also asks users about areas they have travelled to  the researchers said. The app enquires about common symptoms of infection and their duration  including fever  cough  shortness of breath  fatigue  sputum production  headache  diarrhoea and pneumonia. The app will enable the collection of similar information for those who live with the individual but cannot fill out their own survey  said researchers working on the app. According to Bhatia  the enormous smartphone penetration in India is a huge plus factor. His company is in the midst of deploying this platform with the government's support to reach millions of people in India to conduct this assessment early on. "We are also in touch with the Ministry of Health  including senior officials  to bring this tool to a larger expanse. Given the current state of affairs in India over Covid-19  the health minister has shown keen interest " he said. The novel coronavirus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has so far claimed over 4 200 lives and infected more than 117 330 people across 107 countries and territories.

Aggarwal said India was lucky that it didn’t have cases of community transmission  which could have led to a sharp increase in the number of infections. “Right now  luckily for India we do not have any community transmission. We have only a few cases that have come from outside & they have primarily affected their close family members ” he said and added that the major focus was now on community screening for infections. .

It didn’t reflect lack of interest in the debate  but a strategy put in place following the novel coronavirus outbreak. The Lok Sabha secretariat wants to cut down on the number of daily visitors to the Parliament complex as part of its plan to reduce the chances of lawmakers or officials getting infected by the virus. During the budget session  officials pointed out  on an average 2 000 people visit the complex. Officials also indicated that no foreign tour has been finalized for parliamentarians keeping in mind the global outbreak of the virus. “Once the Parliament session gets over  we will look at the calendar for our international engagements and decision will be taken after considering the prevailing health situation and status of coronavirus outbreak ” said a senior official  who requested anonymity. According to the senior official  MPs too  have been requested not to bring guests inside the Parliament building. During the sessions  many MPs bring guests from their constituencies to show them around. As guests of an MP  these visitors get more access to the complex and can enter areas such as the library  canteens or party offices. A circular issued by the Parliament security service branch said  “The casual visitors  visiting party offices and hon’ble members  would be issued a pass only for the outer precincts of Parliament House and in non-restricted areas only. These visitors are not permitted to enter through the building gates of Parliament House.” The security service branch has also mentioned that “the restriction of timing would be for one hour.” The number of those infected by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India rose to 60 on Wednesday as the ministry of health announced that eight new cases had been reported from Kerala and one each from Rajasthan and Delhi. All Parliament officials have been asked to not mark their attendance in the biometric system until March 31 as a precautionary measure against the infection.  While many private enterprises have arranged extra hand sanitizers and masks  such arrangements are still missing in the Parliament complex.  On Wednesday  some security personnel posted at the entry gates to frisk visitors  however  could be seen wearing masks and gloves. Earlier  on March 5  the secretariat had advised all officials to practice simple public health measures of hand and respiratory hygiene. It had also spoken about avoiding large gatherings and restricting entry of non-essential visitors. A senior official added that so far there is no sense of panic but added that if any official is found with symptoms of flu  he or she will be immediately sent to the health centre in the Parliament annex building. “There is no plan for early adjournment of the session ” said another official.

12/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,italy;india,Kerala partially shuts down as coronavirus cases reach 14,State health officials said that among 14 positive cases in Kerala  the condition of two  the grandparents of an Italy-returned man   who dodged health officials at the airport  was serious.,Kerala was in a state of partial shutdown on Wednesday as the number of new coronavirus cases in the state rose to 14 and the Left Front government urged the Centre to revoke a circular issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) stipulating that those who return from countries where the disease has spread obtain a certificate to prove they are virus-free. “It is highly unethical and uncivilized to ask certificates from people stranded in Italy and South Korea. How can you ask your people not to come to the country in such a trying situation? Some of these countries are overloaded with patients and it is difficult to obtain such papers ”chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the state assembly.  The Opposition Congress supported his stance. The assembly is likely to pass a resolution on Thursday urging the Centre to withdraw the DGCA circular immediately. Some of those stranded in Milan and Rome have posted videos narrating their plight. They said they had been forced to disembark from flights to India because the Indian government did not give aircraft permission to fly them back. “We are without food for last two days as all outlets at the airport remain closed. Among stranded are pregnant women and small babies ” one of them said. They said they were ready for quarantine at any place and expressed concern that they had been denied entry into their own country. In Delhi  minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan criticised the Kerala government  saying it was playing politics in trying times. “The entire country is in a battle mode. How can we take suspected coronavirus patients and others on a single flight? Chances of transmission are high. We will send a team of doctors and segregate and fly them back ” he said  adding that Indian embassy officials were in touch with the stranded passengers. State health officials said that among 14 positive cases in Kerala  the condition of two  the grandparents of an Italy-returned man   who dodged health officials at the airport  was serious. State health minister K K Shailaja said doctors were trying their best to save the lives of the 85-year-old grandmother and 90-plus grandfather. From imported cases to local transmission  the state with the highest density of population in the country pressed the emergency button after six cases surfaced on Tuesday.  The fresh cases forced the state government to cancel all public events and close down educational institutions to contain the disease. Shailaja called for strict community surveillance  scaling up of contact tracing and tapping local bodies to stop the spread of the disease. The latest to test positive were the parents of a three- year- old Italy-returned boy admitted in an isolation ward in Kochi.  As many as 2 000 people are under observation; out of these 300 have been admitted to various hospitals. The state is keeping fingers crossed as two dozen test results are expected by Thursday. At least 42 people  who came from Italy  were quarantined in Kochi in the early hours of Wednesday. “We are fighting back with all resources available. What we need is cooperation of people. Two years back we had contained another dangerous virus  nipah  effectively. We will overcome this challenge also ” Shailaja said in the assembly. The state had reported India’s first three cases of coronavirus in January this year. All three were cured.  Two years ago  the state experienced an outbreak of the nipah virus. Although it claimed 17 lives  the outbreak was localised and contained effectively.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/kerala/kerala-partially-shuts-down-as-coronavirus-cases-reach-14/story-MkDpnrk3dUo0lr6ukzLj5N.html

The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers ” said Dr Rajan Sharma  IMA president.,The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily  arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.  “We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public  who are clueless as to what is expected out of them  has created panic ” said IMA in a statement. “We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers ” said Dr Rajan Sharma  IMA president. Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection. “When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported  we got calls from people  who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground ” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity. “In this day and age of information  non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead  sharing the correct information will make people aware ” said Dr Jugal Kishore  head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-not-share-coronavirus-data-daily-ima-to-govt/story-qx0soP8SJAPE4AV8Y6amcK.html

Talking about Indians stranded in the wake of the outbreak  Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha that India has brought back its 58 citizens from Iran and was working with Iranian authorities to operate limited commercial flights for facilitating early return of the others.  “We are hoping by tomorrow [Thursday] to fly in a medical team to Italy ... We will do testing of those people and try to put them on an early flight ” he said. The minister said Iran and Italy were “focal points” for the government as any “worldwide activity” will only add to panic. As many as 529 more samples brought from Iran were being tested at the National Institute of Virolgy  Pune  and those who test negative will be brought back first in the next flights  he said. “Whoever tests negative ... will be on the next lot of flights which will come in. Our effort has been to test as many people as quickly we can. The situation in Italy is emerging a cause of great concern. I would like to share with members that steps in this regard have already been initiated ” the minister said. The minister said there are over 6 000 Indians in various provinces of Iran  which include 1 100 pilgrims  nearly 300 students and about 1 000 fishermen.  Jaishankar said the first batch of 108 samples were received in India on March 7. “These were tested and 58 Indian pilgrims [25 men  31 women and two children]  who tested negative  were repatriated in a special IAF C-17 flight on March 10 ” he said. While about 90 countries have reported coronavirus cases  he said: “We have to focus  prioritise and look at very extreme situations. At the moment  Iran is an extreme situation.

12/03/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Corona scare: State may ask to postpone IPL; to curtail budget session,,The Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to curtail the ongoing budget session by this week and is mulling whether to hold Indian Premier League (IPL) matches without an audience or ask the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to postpone the matches.  “BCCI is ready to hold the IPL tournament without audience. It means there will be no sale of tickets. However  we are yet to receive any official request. We will consider it after receiving. If necessary  the IPL matches can be postponed ” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said. Thackeray said that there is also a view within the government to postpone the matches. “If needed  it [the tournament] won’t be made an exception ” he said.  “There are spectators for many matches being played in the country currently. That said  we are monitoring the situation. The IPL governing council is meeting on Saturday (March 14). That’s when we will look at all the factors and take a decision ” IPL chairman Brijesh Patel told HT. The state has also decided to cancel or postpone all large public gatherings and political events across the state. As a precautionary measure  all civic commissioners have been asked to not issue permissions for such events. Following a review meeting  Thackeray said authorities have established contact with all the 40 people who were part of the group that flew in from Dubai on March 1 and which comprises eight of the state’s known COVID-19 cases. Authorities have also tracked those who have come in contact with them. Thackeray further said that authorities had a discussion with all tour operators in the state  who has informed them that there are around 850-1 000 people from the state in foreign countries. “We have asked them to inform the health department officials as soon as they arrive in the state so that they can be properly screened ” he said. Earlier in the day  the state cabinet had discussed a proposal to allow the IPL to conduct matches without the audience to prevent gathering of people which could lead to spread of the epidemic. The cabinet was also of the view that the government should allow IPL matches if they are happening sans audience. However  after two patients in Mumbai tested positive for corona virus  Thackeray as well as health minister Rajesh Tope seemed to be in favour of not holding the matches. “No final decision is taken on the issue ” Tope said.  It has also decided to curtail the ongoing budget session of the state legislature by Saturday or Sunday. A proposal to this effect will be brought before both the Houses for approval on Thursday  said Thackeray. The decision was taken only to avoid stress on state administration and allow officials and legislators to fulfil their on-field responsibilities  Thackeray said. The session was scheduled to close by the end of the month. He also said that the state government is not taking any decision on declaring holidays in schools as of now. “We are reviewing the situation after every two hours. According to experts there is no need to take such a decision at present. We will wait for the next two days to see how situation is unfolding and then take a call. We don’t want people to panic unnecessarily. Also exams are going on in some schools ” Thackeray said. Thackeray said the state government has requested the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to authorise a few more laboratories to conduct the tests as it is currently available only in Pune  Mumbai and Nagpur. Tope also said 650-700 beds in hospitals and medical colleges across the state are being used for setting up isolation wards and the medical staff is trained to handle the situation. There is enough stock of medicine and medical equipment if needed  he added.  The state cabinet has also decided to postpone the centenary celebrations of Mangaon Conference to be held in Mangaon village of Kolhapur district on March 21. The Mangaon Conference was organised for the rights of untouchables by social reformer Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj and Dr BR Ambedkar in Kolhapur district in 1920.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/corona-scare-state-may-ask-to-postpone-ipl-to-curtail-budget-session/story-mK1kbLZxSnf7gPySOSgfGO.html

10/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,Xi Jinping visits epicentre Wuhan; sign that China believes coronavirus outbreak has turned a corner,Xi’s visit to Wuhan  a city under a lockdown since January 23  is a sign of the highest confidence within the Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government that the epidemic has turned a corner in China.,A mask-wearing President Xi Jinping on Tuesday visited Wuhan  the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic  for the first time since the start of the outbreak as national health authorities continued to report a dramatic fall in new cases of covid-19 in China. Xi’s visit to Wuhan  a city under a lockdown since January 23  is a sign of the highest confidence within the Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government that the epidemic has turned a corner in China. Until this visit  Xi’s second-in-command  Premier Li Keqiang was the senior-most Chinese leader to have visited Wuhan in late January as the outbreak raged in the city and the province of Hubei. On Tuesday  Chinese state media reported on the President first visiting a hospital built in nine days to make space for an overwhelming number of patients  meeting frontline doctors and nurses  volunteers and residents in Wuhan. State media showed Xi speaking via video-link to frontline medics and patients at one of the field hospitals set up in the city  an agency report said. The Chinese President’s visit is also a message to the world that the Chinese way of controlling the epidemic – locking down hundreds of millions in their homes and putting in place severe restrictions on travel – has worked despite criticisms and concerns. The state media’s coverage of the China’s epidemic control has glossed over ample evidence to show that neither local nor central authorities had acted despite their knowledge about the spreading coronavirus weeks before the lockdowns in the worst-hit Hubei province were put in place. Xi’s visit to Wuhan will also likely add layers to the Chinese state’s narrative obfuscating the delay and negligence; and aggressively promote instead the tale of how China is winning the “people’s war” against the virus  which  of course  will be no mean feat as the rest of world suddenly grapples with the pathogen. Xi’s Tuesday visit coincided with a new low in fresh coronavirus cases in China: In the last 24 hours  it was only 19  down from several hundred cases just weeks earlier. As of Tuesday  there have been 80 754 cases of the virus confirmed across China  67 760 of which were in Hubei  the province of which Wuhan is the capital. Of the 3 136 deaths confirmed in China  all but 112 have been in Hubei. Official news agency  Xinhua  reported that Xi arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday “…for an inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work”. Xi  according to Xinhua  “will visit and express regards to medical workers  military officers and soldiers  community workers  police officers  officials and volunteers who have been fighting the epidemic on the front line  as well as patients and residents during the inspection.” It was more than a month ago that the death of Li Wenliang  a doctor who died from the covid-19 illness in February  sparked a wave of grief and anger online. Li was among a group of people who had raised the alarm as early as late December but was harassed and detained by the Wuhan police for doing so. A visit by vice premier Sun Chunlan to a Wuhan residential community last week was met with angry public heckling  showing how easily state propaganda efforts could backfire  the news agency AFP reported.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-visits-epicentre-wuhan-sign-that-china-believes-coronavirus-outbreak-has-turned-a-corner/story-83qk6jYwVb7CAWYNcnoFDO.html

While there’s been no published research yet explaining why  Chinese doctors working in Wuhan  the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged  have noticed that infected patients with that underlying illness are more likely to slip into severe distress and die. Of a group of 170 patients who died in January in Wuhan -- the first wave of casualties caused by a pathogen that’s now raced around the world -- nearly half had hypertension. “That’s a very high ratio ” said Du Bin  director of the intensive care unit at Peking Union Medical College Hospital  in an interview with Bloomberg over the phone from Wuhan. He was among a team of top doctors sent to the devastated city two months ago to help treat patients there. “From what I was told by other doctors and the data I can see myself  among all the underlying diseases  hypertension is a key dangerous factor ” said Du  one of the most respected critical care experts in China. “Though there is no research published on that yet  we believe hypertension could be an important factor in causing patients to deteriorate  leading to a bad prognosis.” As the outbreak picks up speed in Europe and the U.S.  plunging countries like Italy into crisis  doctors are struggling to treat the highly-infectious pathogen that’s infected over 108 000 people globally in just three months. Understanding the course of the disease and identifying individuals at greatest risk are critical for optimizing care for a global contagion that’s killed more than 3 700 people since emerging in China in December. Answers may lie in studying the large pool of patients in China  where more than 15 000 remain hospitalized although new infections have slowed dramatically. The disease turns critical in 6% of patients and deterioration can happen very quickly. “We’ll keep an eye on old people and those with high blood pressure. They are the key focus ” said Du. Besides the hypertension factor  Du’s other insights into treating the disease are: Move Aggressively to Ventilate Du said that doctors should not hesitate to escalate measures for patients facing respiratory distress  as organ failure can set in quickly after. That means doctors should intervene aggressively with invasive ventilation measures -- inserting a tube into a patient’s throat or cutting the throat open to create an airway -- when low blood oxygen levels can’t be improved by less invasive measures. Almost half of the patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation end up dying  but most of those who recover are those who were put on invasive ventilation early  said Du. “Patients need to use invasive ventilation as early as possible  there’s no point of doing it late ” he said. Respiratory therapists -- doctors that specialize in ventilation and oxygen treatment -- are becoming all the more important in treating patients critically ill with Covid-19 as they are more knowledgeable and can fine-tune ventilators to suit patient conditions. No ‘Magic Bullets’ in Drugs There is growing anticipation over drugs being developed to treat the virus  with investors adding billions to the market value of pharmaceutical companies testing treatments now. But Du said drugs alone cannot save patients  especially those in severe condition. The experience of SARS  the epidemic 17 years ago that sickened almost 8 000 people  showed that most patients can be cured without a specific anti-viral drug  said Du. And the abundance of antibiotics has not prevented deaths by bacterial infections  he added. “When there’s a virus infection  we hope there’s a drug that can kill the virus and change the clinical outcome. But there’s no magic bullet.” Instead  teamwork among specialists and nurses in intensive care units can be more crucial in keeping patients alive  he said. “An ICU doctor should work like a conductor in an orchestra to provide life-sustaining treatment while taking into consideration different specialist views ” he said. Threat of Re-infection Reports that people who have recovered and been discharged from hospital later test positive again -- and even die from the disease -- have ignited fears that the virus can somehow re-emerge. Du said that patients becoming re-infected again within days of leaving the hospital makes no sense “theoretically” as the anti-bodies in their bloodstream generated from fighting the disease do not disappear so quickly  although they don’t necessarily stay forever. “What we need to look at in terms of those who tested positive again is concerns over the authenticity of their negative results ” he said. For example  samples taken from different areas of the same patient could test differently depending on where the virus resides. Test kits made by different manufacturers could also have inconsistencies that impact test results  he said. Mild Impact on Pregnant Women  Children Despite their seeming physical vulnerability  pregnant women and children do not seem to be affected by the coronavirus in a serious manner  Du said. This is in contrast to other viruses like influenza. “From what we known  infected pregnant women do not get into a serious situation with the coronavirus ” Du said. “With influenza  pregnancy is a high risk factor that can cause severe symptoms and lead to bad outcomes  but not this time.” Children infected with the coronavirus also seem to experience only mild symptoms  said Du. He has not seen any child infections deteriorate to a state which requires intensive care.

10/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,Amazon India  Grofers  and Flipkart respond to price gouging  scarcity of hand sanitizers amid coronavirus fears,Amazon India said it was “disappointed” that some sellers were trying to artificially inflate the prices of basic need products in a global health crisis.,E-commerce companies are struggling to curb the price gouging and shortage of hand sanitizers and masks on their platforms amid coronavirus outbreak that has affected more than 100 000 people around the world. Responding to the criticism  Amazon India on Monday said it is constantly monitoring the developments related to COVID-19 and will take "appropriate steps" as needed.  "We are disappointed that some sellers are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis. In line with our policy  we continue to actively monitor our marketplace and take necessary action (including removing offers) against sellers who are selling such products above the MRP  which is in violation of Indian laws" said an Amazon India spokesperson in a statement. Amazon India  however  isn't the only e-commerce platform to face price gouging and shortage of hand sanitizers and masks. As mentioned in our previous report  Grofers  BigBasket  and Flipkart are also grappling with the same. Many people on Twitter pointed out that hand sanitizers from top brands such as Dettol  Lifebuoy  and Himalaya had completely run out. Some sellers were also found to be selling sanitizers from relatively less known brands at a price much higher than their original price.  A 30ml bottle of @HimalayaIndia hand sanitizer usually available for less than ₹50 is being sold on @Flipkart for ₹999 or $13. Buyers on the platform black marketing while @Flipkart turns a blind eye. @jagograhakjago @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc pic.twitter.com/Tq3aCRwbEh Albinder Dhindsa  Co-founder and CEO  Grofers said  "While we are expecting the frontline brands to be back in stock  our Own Brand - O'range Hand sanitizer will soon be made available to cater to the current demand of our customers. It has over 60% alcohol content and conforms to European efficacy standard EN 1500: 2013. Due to the higher demand  the cost of ingredients used in sanitizer is under pressure and will go up for other brands. However  Grofers Own Brand is making efforts to secure them at competitive prices to provide it to our customers at the most affordable price  like always."  pic.twitter.com/9sKL5EXNwX When reached out to Flipkart  the company directed us to its March 6 blog post where it has outlined preparedness for the virus outbreak. "The Flipkart Seller Hub is continuously in touch with Flipkart sellers to promote preventative healthcare and hygiene. Our team has communicated necessary precautions in order to ensure the health and safety of our marketplace sellers and their staff amid concerns over public health during the recent global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak " the company wrote in the blog post. "Our marketplace team has appealed to the seller community to ensure that products like masks  sanitizers  antiseptic liquids  and handwash are made available to our customers at all times at the best possible prices. They have been advised to dispatch these products on priority " it added. BigBasket has declined to comment on the issue.

10/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;hong kong;singapore,China’s Xi pays first visit to virus epicentre Wuhan,The Communist Party leader arrived by plane in Hubei’s capital for an “inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work” in the region  according to the official Xinhua news agency.,Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday for his first visit to the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic since the crisis erupted in January -- a major sign that officials believe the outbreak is under control. Xi’s unannounced visit comes as unprecedented quarantine measures that have sealed off Wuhan and the rest of central Hubei province since late January appear to have paid off  with new infections dropping dramatically in recent weeks. The Communist Party leader arrived by plane in Hubei’s capital for an “inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work” in the region  according to the official Xinhua news agency. State media showed Xi  wearing a mask  speaking via video-link to frontline medical workers and patients at one of the field hospitals set up in the city. Xi will also visit military officials  community workers  police  patients and residents  Xinhua said. China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is usually a daily fixture in state media but has stayed out of the spotlight for much of the crisis and assigned Premier Li Keqiang to oversee the response to the epidemic. Li and a vice premier have already visited the virus-stricken city of Wuhan. But as the number of new cases has fallen in recent weeks  state media has played up Xi’s role in the fight against the outbreak  releasing a speech last month in which he said he had been giving instructions since early January. “During the worst of the outbreak  Xi avoided the epicentre because he did not want to be blamed  but when the situation gets better  he shows up in order to receive praise ” said Bruce Lui  a senior lecturer in journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University.  Authorities have faced rare and fierce criticism online over their handling of the virus  with local officials coming under particular scrutiny for punishing whistleblowers in an apparent attempt to cover up the outbreak in early January. Jean-Pierre Cabestan  a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University  said that the carefully orchestrated visit was “long overdue for most Chinese”. “Xi is trying to regain the initiative  to show that he is a considerate and caring leader  but also that he is in charge ” he said. Global cases soar The death of doctor Li Wenliang  who died from the COVID-19 illness in February  sparked a wave of grief and anger online. He was among a group of people who had raised the alarm as early as December. A visit by vice premier Sun Chunlan to a Wuhan residential community last week was met with angry public heckling  showing how easily state propaganda efforts could backfire.  “Sun had to bear these risk factors first for Xi  like clearing a minefield before he arrived ” said Lui.  The virus is believed to have emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in Wuhan before ballooning into a national and then a global epidemic. More than 4 000 people have died and over 110 000 have been infected worldwide  with the majority in China  though daily infections are now growing at a much faster pace abroad. China reported only 19 new cases on Tuesday  the lowest figure since it started publishing data on January 21. Seventeen cases were in Wuhan while the other two were imported from abroad. The country had been tallying thousands of cases every week in January and most of February. Alfred Wu  associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy  said that Xi’s visit was to signal that the “outbreak has basically ended in China”  given the steady decline in new cases.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-pays-first-visit-to-virus-epicentre-wuhan/story-oFGwkhvBOfxv096wgKYeeK.html

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Monday that testing was not necessary because President Trump is not showing symptoms and the lawmakers aren’t confirmed to be infected. “The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients  nor does he have any symptoms ” Grisham said. “President Trump remains in excellent health  and his physician will continue to closely monitor him ” she said. The White House statement came as Trump was in contact with multiple lawmakers who have since gone into self-imposed quarantine. These lawmakers had come into contact with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who tested positive for the deadly coronavirus. The virus is believed to have an incubation period of about 14 days.   Earlier during a news conference  Trump assured the country that his administration is taking all necessary steps to bring it under control.   “We are going to take care of  and have been taking care of  the American public and the American economy ” he said. Vice President Mike Pence  who is leading the efforts on coronavirus  said the risk of contracting the virus to the American public remains low  and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low. “The President did deploy not just a whole-of-government approach  but also a whole-of-America approach. And last week  at the President’s direction  we met with leaders in industries  from nursing homes to airlines  pharmaceutical companies  commercial labs  and it’s had great  great impact ” he said. “Pharmaceutical companies are already working  literally around the clock  on the development of therapeutics; that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the coronavirus. I know how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country  led by companies like LabCorp and Quest  have already brought a test forward and are taking that to market effective today ” he said. This week  they plan to have meetings with hospital CEOs  health insurance CEOs  and building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with regard to economic relief for working Americans.

Those involved in the tourism business in the coastal state  which is increasingly dependent on the arrival of travellers from within the country  have said they do not expect the crisis to blow over at least until the end of April.  School holiday after that will kick in and might help boost the arrivals  they said. “Tourism arrivals are down by 50% and this is particularly visible over the weekend when we should have seen a huge spike in footfalls  it being a long weekend ” John Lobo  a shack owner along the Baga beach  said.  Besides domestic visitors  cruise tourism arrivals have completely stopped as well with operators giving Goa stopover a slip. On Monday  Mormugao Port Trust announced it would not welcome more cruise ships until March 31.  While tourism arrivals have been low in general over the course of the season  fear of coronavirus spreading has hit it further.  “We are going through difficult times and there is a likelihood that the same may continue for a long period of time. The recent outbreak of coronavirus has had a great impact on tourism globally ” Sainath Dharwatkar  the president of the Goa unit of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI)  said.  “In these crises  TAAI both the national and the local chapter is committed to standing shoulder to shoulder with the government in its efforts to control the situation ” he said. Goa’s health minister Vishwajit Rane had warned against large gatherings while also assuring that the state had the situation under control.  “Mass gatherings should be avoided and don’t take a risk in today’s time. At least for the next two to three months  we should avoid these gatherings and any programmes which involve mass contact of people should be avoided ” he had said. Goa celebrates its annual spring festival of Shigmo that witnesses street parades organised across the villages and towns of Goa which necessitates “mass gatherings”.  The state administration has  however  advised those showing flu-like symptoms to stay at home as a precaution.

09/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,bangladesh;india;afghanistan;pakistan,PM Modi’s visit to Bangladesh deferred amid coronavirus scare,Bangladesh told India fresh dates for the commemorative events would be conveyed later.,India on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had put off a visit to Bangladesh to participate in celebrations marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman following Dhaka’s decision to defer public events after the detection of Coronavirus infections. Bangladesh’s decision came against the backdrop of large-scale protests against India’s controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the communal violence in New Delhi that killed more than 40 people. Several Bangladeshi political parties and groups had opposed the Indian leader’s participation in the celebrations. On Sunday  Bangladeshi officials said the launch of the birth centenary celebrations of the country’s founder would be scaled down or postponed after three Coronavirus infections were detected. Modi and other world leaders were invited to participate in a rally on March 17 to mark the start of the celebrations. India received a formal notification from Bangladesh about these public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation  external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said. “The impact of this deferment applies also to the large gathering planned for March 17  at which the prime minister of India was invited ” he said. “In this context  prime minister’s visit to Bangladesh next week at the invitation of …Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is being deferred...India is ready to work with Bangladesh  as partners  to combat the spread of this disease in our shared neighbourhood ” he added. This was second foreign visit by Modi that was called off because of COVID-19-related concerns. Last week  India put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.  Bangladesh told India fresh dates for the commemorative events would be conveyed later. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the two sides are looking at the possibility of Modi joining the small-scale inauguration of the celebrations on March 17 through video conferencing. Hasina  who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with Modi  has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with Modi during their last two meetings in September and October. This criticism increased after the Indian Parliament passed the CAA last December and again after the sectarian violence in New Delhi. Following the weekly Friday prayers on March 6  large numbers of people joined protests in Dhaka and other cities opposing the Indian leader’s visit. A grouping of 46 Islamic organisations called on the government to withdraw the invitation to the Indian premier. People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party  who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975. New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA  saying it’s an internal matter  and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh. Former ambassador Rajiv Dogra said the CAA  irrespective of whether it was a correct move  had impacted relations with friendly countries such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “This is even more so in the case of Bangladesh  which is more sensitive and with which relations have been excellent. It was a diplomatic disaster to lump it with Pakistan in the CAA as countries that persecute minorities ” he said. “This was an opportunity that was exploited by Sheikh Hasina’s opponents and the recent protests were a warning that the Indian premier’s visit  if it had gone ahead  would have had more negatives than positives. It’s hard to accept the reasoning that a cherished event in Bangladesh was deferred solely because of a few cases of Coronavirus ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-visit-to-bangladesh-deferred-amid-coronavirus-scare/story-WUOwK1FUoiI9AC1exQGCnM.html
09/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;china;italy,Govt asks CAPF to expand quarantine facility amid coronavirus scare in India,These forces  comprising the Central Reserve Police Force  the Border Security Force  the Central Industrial Security Force  the Indo-Tibetan Border Police  the Sashastra Seema Bal and the National Security Guard  have also been asked to create 75 isolation wards as part of preparations to combat possible large-scale outbreak of the virus.,The government has directed the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to prepare quarantine facilities with a bed capacity to admit over 5 400 people to deal with cases of coronavirus across the country  officials said on Monday. These forces  comprising the Central Reserve Police Force  the Border Security Force  the Central Industrial Security Force  the Indo-Tibetan Border Police  the Sashastra Seema Bal and the National Security Guard  have also been asked to create 75 isolation wards as part of preparations to combat possible large-scale outbreak of the virus. Officials told PTI that the Union home ministry has asked these forces to create a total of 5 440-bed capacity at 37 locations in the country. 75 isolation wards are also to be created at these locations by these forces  they said. “The aim is to build capacity. These forces have also been asked to earmark and depute their respective teams of doctors  paramedics and sanitation officials who will man these quarantine facilities ” a senior home ministry officer said. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force  which is already running such a quarantine centre in Delhi’s Chhawla area  has also been asked to prepare training modules for specialist trainers of these forces. ITBP experts will hold workshops and prepare online modules for these forces to make them understand the management and other medical protocols to run a quarantine centre for coronavirus affected people  officials said. The second batch of people  including Indians and foreigners  evacuated from Wuhan in China are still living at the ITBP centre. ITBP Director General (DG) S S Deswal  they said  will also be holding an awareness session on these measures on a Doordarshan free-to-air DTH platform  Vande Gujarat. All these forces have also been asked to conduct awareness and outreach programmes as part of preparing the community against the coronavirus  they said. The number of coronavirus cases in India rose to 43 on Monday with four people  including a three-year-old child in Kerala who had returned from Italy  testing positive for the disease  Health Ministry officials said. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday said the government is prepared to deal with the issue and his ministry is sending directives  including guidelines  to states in all the languages on ways to contain it.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-capf-to-expand-quarantine-facility-amid-coronavirus-scare-in-india/story-QvaRKXNDpYnyJguF0C0P4J.html
09/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;china;saudi arabia,Petrol price falls below Rs 71 in India amid Saudi  Russia price war,For India  which imports over 84 per cent of its oil needs  the slump would lead to lower import bill and a cut in retail prices but will harm already stressed upstream firms such as ONGC. Lower oil prices will also help economy from its 11-year low growth rate by way of reducing input cost for a lot of sectors.,Petrol prices slipped below Rs 71-mark for the first time in eight months on Monday as India looks set to reap windfall from a price war among oil producers leading to international crude prices crashing by their biggest margin since the 1991 Gulf war. International oil prices crashed by close to 31 per cent  the second-largest margin on record  after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Brent futures plummeted to about USD 31 a barrel on Monday as Goldman Sachs warned prices could drop to near USD 20. For India  which imports over 84 per cent of its oil needs  the slump would lead to lower import bill and a cut in retail prices but will harm already stressed upstream firms such as ONGC. Lower oil prices will also help economy from its 11-year low growth rate by way of reducing input cost for a lot of sectors. In Delhi  petrol prices dropped to Rs 70.59 a litre  the lowest since early July 2019  and diesel rate were cut to Rs 63.26  according to a price notification of state-owned firms. Fuel prices have been on the decline since Februray 27 on international trends. Petrol prices have in all fallen by Rs 1.42 a litre since then and diesel rates have dropped by Rs 1.44 per litre. But the only dampener in the entire scheme of things is rupee which settled 23 paise down at 74.10 against the US dollar. A weaker rupee means India pays more for buying the same amount of commodity from overseas. It will also help lower inflation rate. According to the oil ministry’s petroleum planning and analysis cell  India is likely to pay USD 105.58 billion or Rs 7.43 lakh crore on import of 225 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year 2019-20  which ends this month. This compares to USD 111.9 billion (Rs 7.83 lakh crore) paid for import of 226.5 million tonnes of oil in 2018-19. The 2019-20 projection is based on average price of USD 66 per barrel for the basket of crude oil India imports and average exchange rate of 71 to a US dollar. Oil company officials said the import bill will fall in the next fiscal beginning April but an estimation cannot be made given the extreme volatility in the oil and currency market. It certainly will translate into lower retail prices of petrol and diesel in the coming days as the current rates do not reflect the slump in international prices  they said. Retail prices of the day are based on average price of benchmark international fuel of the preceeding fortnight. And the drop in prices to USD 31 will get reflected in retail prices over the next 7-10 days. The moving average helps narrow the extreme volatility in the prices  they said. On the negative side  lower oil prices mean they become more competitive versus renewable energy and delay switchover to cleaner fuels in fight against climate change. Industry association Assocham said the fall in crude prices will help India recover as low prices of crude can be a demand driver while also taming the inflation. However  Morgan Stanley believes that the drop in oil prices may not be good news for the economy as the gains will remain capped due to the overall weakness in the economy given the coronavirus-related health scare. The decline in oil prices  it said  will negatively impact the capex outlook for oil related sectors as well as oil producing countries. The fall in oil prices comes at a time when the global economy is already reeling under the impact of coronavirus  which has dented demand across sectors and economies. Rating agency Icra said the plunge in crude oil prices is credit negative for Indian upstream companies as their realisations and cash accruals will decline. If the crude prices were to remain in the band of $30-40 per barrel  most of the Indian upstream companies could report losses  as the cost structure would remain rigid in the short-run. Additionally  gas prices at various international gas hubs have declined  which would lead to lower domestic gas prices in the next fiscal. Accordingly  the realisations on gas sales would also decrease even as gas production remains either a break-even or a loss-making proposition for most fields for the upstream producers  notwithstanding some decline in oilfield services/equipment cost  Icra said. International Energy Agency (IEA) on Monday cut global oil demand forecast for 2020 by 1.1 million barrels per day as coronavirus spread beyond China. For the first time since 2009  demand is expected to fall year-on-year  by 90 000 barrels per day to 99.9 million barrels per day in 2020. “While the situation remains fluid  we expect global oil demand to fall in 2020 – the first full-year decline in more than a decade – because of the deep contraction in China  which accounted for more than 80 per cent of global oil demand growth in 2019  and major disruptions to travel and trade ” it said. Saudi Arabia slashed its oil prices over the weekend by most in at least 20 years and pledged to increase production after Russia refused to join the OPEC in a production cut as the spread of corona virus continues to slow the global economy and oil demand. The kingdom plans to raise production to 10 million barrels per day next month from 9.7 million barrels per day currently and could even reach 12 million barrels per day amid -- an unambiguous declaration of intent to flood the market with crude. Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/petrol-price-falls-below-rs-71-in-india-amid-saudi-russia-price-war/story-S2xl7TtNsuqJ0kSXmTmhsI.html

A few residents of Worli  Mumbai  have taken it upon themselves to give a face to that demon and burn it  at least symbolically. Following the tradition of Holika Dahan  the residents have come up with an effigy of coronavirus and given it the name “Coronasur.” Traditionally  on the eve of Holi a model of the demoness Holika is burned to signify the victory of good over evil. Considering COVID-19 is among the present day evils claiming lives  the symbolic burning doesn’t seem so weird after all – or so some people suggest. A picture of “Coronasur” was shared on Twitter by new agency ANI. “An effigy based on the theme of #CoronaVirus has been put up in Worli  ahead of ‘Holika Dahan’ today. #Holi ” they wrote.

The hand sanitizer doesn’t taste bad either. Cheers to Tito’s vodka. Keeping me germ-free and feeling good at the same time ” said Texas-based Twitter user Snottypotty. Another user called Kaliel said “gonna make some hand sanitizer from @TitosVodka to keep safe from the corona virus ” while another fan  Rick Holter  suggested keeping a bottle of vodka handy for hand washing.

09/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;georgia;india;italy;jersey,US virus cases pass 500 as California readies for cruise ship arrival,Some 30 US states have been hit by the novel coronavirus  with Oregon the latest to declare an emergency  and 60 million people in California and New York are under crisis measures.,The number of US coronavirus cases soared past 500 Sunday  including two further deaths  as California braced for the arrival of infected cruise ship passengers and saw a major tennis event canceled. The surge came as President Donald Trump defended his administration’s “perfectly coordinated” response to the epidemic  after heavy criticism over health cuts and strategic blunders that have failed to stem its rapid spread. Some 30 US states have been hit by the novel coronavirus  with Oregon the latest to declare an emergency  and 60 million people in California and New York are under crisis measures. Two more deaths linked to a virus-hit care home near Seattle were reported Sunday  bringing the nationwide toll to at least 21. A Johns Hopkins tally put the number of confirmed US cases at 554 by Sunday evening  with newly diagnosed patients in states including Pennsylvania  Illinois  Massachusetts  Connecticut and New Jersey. Medical officers headed for a virus-hit cruise ship stranded off San Francisco to begin screening passengers for an “unprecedented and difficult” landing operation. The Grand Princess  with 21 confirmed coronavirus infections among 3 500 people on board  is due to dock in nearby Oakland Monday. The operation to move passengers ashore will take two to three days  said Governor Gavin Newsom. Passenger quarantine Carolyn Wright  a passenger on the ship  told AFP that people without symptoms were allowed to leave their cabins for the first time since Thursday. Once ashore  ill passengers will be moved to hospitals  while Americans not requiring treatment will be quarantined at military bases in California  Texas and Georgia for 14 days. Foreign passengers will be repatriated  while crew will remain quarantined on board. The State Department warned vulnerable people including the elderly “should not travel by cruise ship.” Several public events have been canceled across the US in an effort to contain the epidemic. The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells was called off on Sunday just days before it was due to begin. Officials said they opted to cancel after the health department of California’s Riverside County declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley -- in the desert east of Los Angeles -- after a confirmed case of COVID-19 locally. The tournament is one of the biggest outside the four Grand Slams and draws more than 400 000 fans each year. ‘Flat-footed’ Trump has defended his record after accusations he peddled misinformation on the outbreak  blaming the media for trying to make his government “look bad.” “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus ” he tweeted. “We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas  which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!” But Larry Hogan  the Republican governor of Maryland  criticized Trump  telling NBC the president “hasn’t communicated the way I would  and the way I might like him to.” Fellow Republican Ted Cruz  a US senator  revealed he had shaken hands at a conservative conference with a person who later tested positive. “I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week  until a full 14 days have passed ” he wrote on Facebook  adding he had no symptoms. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington last month. Trump has been heavily rebuked for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration’s experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus. He has downplayed the threat posed by the epidemic  which has killed more than 3 500 people since emerging in China  suggesting cases were “going very substantially down  not up.” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said federal health authorities had been “caught flat-footed” and had “handcuffed” the ability of individual states to respond. “Their messages are all over the place  frankly ” he told Fox News. Anthony Fauci  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  told Fox News that the possibility of following Italy’s example in locking down large sections of the population could not be ruled out. “You don’t want to alarm people but  given the spread we’ve seen  anything is possible ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-virus-cases-pass-500-as-california-readies-for-cruise-ship-arrival/story-Wop7oeCWwcW7Zm5NfpWPRP.html
09/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;austria;bulgaria;egypt;hong kong;hungary;cambodia;macao;maldives;peru,China reports 22 deaths  closes makeshift hospitals as coronavirus cases drop,China’s National Health Commission  (NHC) said on Monday it received reports of 40 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus  the lowest number of fresh cases since it started reporting the data in January.,China has reported 22 new deaths from the deadly coronavirus  the lowest number of fatalities in more than a month  taking the death toll to 3 119  while the new confirmed cases hit a record low to 40  prompting authorities to close 11 temporary hospitals at the virus epicentre in Wuhan. China’s National Health Commission  (NHC) said on Monday it received reports of 40 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus  the lowest number of fresh cases since it started reporting the data in January  and 22 deaths on Sunday on the Chinese mainland. The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80 735 by the end of Sunday which included 3 119 people who have died so far  19 016 patients undergoing treatment and 58 600 patients discharged after recovery  the NHC said. Among the deaths on Sunday  21 were in Hubei Province and one in Guangdong Province. Meanwhile  60 new suspected cases were reported taking the total to 421 people  it said. Also on Sunday  four imported cases (people coming from abroad) of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland  all of which were in Gansu Province. By the end of Sunday  67 imported cases had been reported  the NHC said. By the end of Sunday  114 confirmed cases  including three deaths have been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)  10 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR  and 45 in Taiwan including one death  state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Meanwhile  China has begun dismantling a host of temporary hospitals built-in big public places like auditoriums and sports complexes in Wuhan set up during the massive surge of virus cases in January and February. China has built two makeshift hospitals with 2 300 beds capacity in just about 10 days’ time in early February and later started converting public buildings into hospitals to meet the rush of patients. Two makeshift hospitals were suspended on Sunday in Wuhan  capital of central China’s Hubei Province and the heart of the novel coronavirus outbreak  as the number of patients continued to drop  local officials said. The city has suspended the operation of 11 makeshift hospitals  which were converted from public facilities for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms in the city  the report said. One of these two hospitals  converted from a sports venue  had 1 000 beds with more than 1 000 medical and other staff. A total of 1 056 patients have been treated here since February 12  with no medical staff infected. Another hospital  covering over 6 100 square meters treated 990 patients with 996 beds since February 17. The medical staff in these hospitals will be on standby. The provincial health commission said earlier that Hubei will gradually shut down temporary hospitals and cut the number of hospitals designated for the disease while maintaining strict prevention and control measures. Hubei province and its capital Wuhan continued to be in lockdown since January 23 with all public and private transport banned. Officials say the restrictions would be gradually eased keeping up with the trend of the COVID-19 slowdown. According to the daily situation report on the COVID-19 released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Sunday  seven more countries have seen local transmission of the virus  bringing the number of countries and regions where local transmission emerged to 53 in addition to China.   The seven countries are Cambodia  Austria  Hungary  Egypt  Peru  Bulgaria and Maldives. A total of 105 586 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported worldwide as of Sunday  an increase of 3 656 infections from the previous day  including 3 610 new cases outside China.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-22-deaths-closes-makeshift-hospitals-as-coronavirus-cases-drop/story-GAZNHrth3VUIW05lQwDEeO.html
09/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,japan,Coronavirus outbreak leads to fear of economic recession in Japan,The world’s third-largest economy shrank an annualised 7.1% in the quarter to December  revised data showed on Monday.,Japan’s economy shrank faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter to mark the biggest drop in more than five years as capital expenditure slumped  casting a deeper shadow over the outlook as the coronavirus hit heightened recession risks. The economy is under growing pressure as the outbreak disrupts supply chains and damages tourism  which follows the hit to consumption after October’s sales tax hike. The bleak data piles renewed pressure on the government and the central bank to deploy stronger fiscal and monetary support to underpin a fragile economic recovery. “Unfortunately  any recovery in Q1 has been nipped in the bud by the global spread of the coronavirus ” said Tom Learmouth  Japan economist at Capital Economics  adding that he was expecting the economy to contract 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the current quarter. “That’s likely to be primarily driven by plunging export volumes. And from late-February until the virus spread shows signs of dissipating  we expect consumer spending to be hit hard as many people self-isolate by staying at home.” The world’s third-largest economy shrank an annualised 7.1% in the quarter to December  revised data showed on Monday  weaker than a preliminary reading of a 6.3% contraction and a bigger decline than a median market forecast for a 6.6% drop. The decline  which was the fastest pace since April-June 2014  was blamed largely on a bigger-than-expected fall in capital expenditure - which had been considered the lone bright spot in an otherwise weakening economy. The deeper contraction and the virus have fuelled fears Japan could see growth contract for two straight quarters in the current quarter - the definition of a recession - piling pressure on policymakers to deploy further stimulus steps. Capital spending dropped 4.6% from the previous quarter  worse than a preliminary 3.7% decline and the biggest drop since 2009  in a sign soft global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war took a toll on investment appetite. Private consumption fell 2.8% from the third quarter  roughly in line with the preliminary 2.9% decline  as households withheld spending after a sales tax hike last October. The weakness in domestic demand casts doubt on the Bank of Japan’s argument that robust capital expenditure will offset some of the pain from soft exports. The BOJ may take steps next week to ease the financial strain of firms hit by slumping sales from the virus outbreak  sources have told Reuters. Adding to the pain for the export-reliant economy  Tokyo’s Nikkei stock average fell 4% and the yen spiked as investors flocked to the safety of the Japanese currency. A senior Japanese finance ministry official told reporters on Monday “nervous moves” were seen in the currency market and that he would watch moves with a greater sense of urgency. If the yen’s spike continues  the BOJ may be pressured to take bolder steps beyond financial assistance to small firms  some analysts say. The government  for its part  plans to compile a second package of emergency measures to deal with the virus on Tuesday  though any spending will be modest in size and funded by reserves set aside for emergency purposes. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has come under fire for his handling of the crisis as the number of coronavirus cases in Japan reached over 1 100  just as the nation prepares to host the summer Olympic Games in July and August.

09/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;finland;united kingdom;hong kong;india;italy;united states,Only silver lining: Carbon emissions down 25% in China as flights  industries bear coronavirus brunt,Experts believe that the health care crisis  which is likely to result in a significant slump in the economy but may also lead to a marginal bend in the global CO2 emissions curve  albeit briefly.,China has recorded around 25% drop in Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions since the first week of February amid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak  according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The spread of COVID-19 to the United States (US) and Europe has led to a significant reduction to both airline capacity utilisation and global oil demand. Experts believe that the health care crisis  which is likely to result in a significant slump in the economy but may also lead to a marginal bend in the global CO2 emissions curve  albeit briefly.  The CO2 emission reduction in China is mainly due to coal consumption in the world’s most populous country’s power plants falling by 36%; coal throughput at the largest coal port declining by 29%  oil refinery utilisation capacity reducing by 34% and low output among major industrial sectors which may have decreased by a range of 15% to 40% during the same period  said the analysis published in Carbon Brief  a United Kingdom-based portal on climate change. Every year during the Chinese New Year in February  China closes major installations  construction sites for a week leading to a reduction in energy demand but this year the usual fall in energy use has been prolonged amid no sign of a rebound. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency’s (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites also showed a significant decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over China between February 10 and 25. “There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus ” a NASA Earth observatory analysis said. The NASA maps with NO2 values across China from January 1-20  2020 [before the quarantine] and February 10-25 [during the quarantine] show a perceptible reduction. According to the analysis  the reduction in NO2 pollution was first recorded near Wuhan  the epicentre of the outbreak in central China  but eventually spread across the country. “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop over such a wide area for a specific event ” Fei Liu  an air quality researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is quoted saying in the analysis. Similar drop in NO2 over several countries was recorded during the global economic recession in 2008.  There may be a reduction in CO2 emissions globally because of the massive impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector and business in general. According to OAG  a UK-based travel data provider  the scheduled airline capacity globally between January and April as compared to last year was 40.8 million fewer seats. OAG data also shows that scheduled air line capacity more than halved between January 20 and February 10 but it has recovered by 50% from February 24 to March 2. But Hong Kong and South Korea continue to record steep declines. According to the International Energy Agency’s oil market report for February  global oil demand has been hit hard amid the widespread shutdown of China’s economy. Demand is now expected to fall for the first time in over 10 years. “We have cut our 2020 growth forecast by 365 kilo barrels per day (kb/d) to 825 kb/d  the lowest since 2011. Lower-than-expected consumption in OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] trimmed last year’s growth to 885 kb/d ” the report has said. Data shows that the steep rise in CO2 emissions is likely to be curbed and may also bend the curve  albeit briefly. A graph by the Global Carbon Project shows CO2 emissions dropped leading to brief bends in the emissions curve during the oil crisis in the mid-19070’s and 1980  after the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 1990  during the SARs (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The global crises have thrown up a pattern: travel can be optimised and underlined the importance of maintaining local supply chains which can reduce global CO2 emissions. “Many of the travel restrictions in place in China have come at a tremendous human and economic cost -- people not being able to access health care  go to work among others. However  there has also been impressive adoption of video conferencing  remote working and other modern solutions in businesses  which are a real alternative to commuting and business travel. There is a possibility that once the crisis is over  we will see a permanent change in using these solutions to reduce the need to spend time  money and fossil fuels on travel ” said Lauri Myllyvirta  a Finland-based lead analyst of CREA.  But it is difficult to assess how the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted emissions in the US and Europe because the restrictions in these countries are nowhere close to China. “Besides the impact on flights and freight ships to and from China  the impact in the EU [European Union] and the US isn’t anywhere near on the same level. Global supply chains have been affected but most of the emissions from those are in China and in countries supplying commodities to China. The measures implemented elsewhere  with the exception of those five cities in Italy  aren’t anywhere near as dramatic as those affected in China  with factories  construction sites  freight lines etc shut for weeks ” Myllvyirta added. In terms of reducing air pollution  there is a lesson  said Anumita Roy Chowdhury  executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment. “These are crisis induced changes that people have made. The cumulative impact of economic slowdown and travel restrictions on air quality can be seen. The lesson is in the long run where we need policies to reduce travel intensity and distances to have a similar effect. The way of connecting with each other and work will have to change ” she said. “If we want a respite from the climate change mess... we need net zero emissions by the middle of this century. This is for a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius... even if we have a temporary  minor dip in CO2 emissions due to the current  epidemic  it will not help ” said Roxy Mathew Koll  senior climate scientist at Climate Research Lab  Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Most analysts worry that once Beijing has weathered through the current crisis  a round of “retaliatory emissions” will follow. “So  for China  the story is: significant short term emission decline [at the expense of economic growth’  with many medium-to-long-term uncertainties  and a potential of further embracing heavy industries ” said Li Shuo  senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia who is based in Beijing.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-silver-lining-carbon-emissions-down-25-in-china-as-flights-industries-bear-coronavirus-brunt/story-13yDMUEPZwJyrISZqo1kKM.html

An First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against Subu Kena Tsering based on a complaint filed by the district medical officer Kaling Daiat Pasighat police station on Friday  the police added.  Tsering allegedly posted in a Facebook group that coronavirus infection has reached Pasighat and two patients have been referred to Dibrugarh in upper Assam  officials were quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He is yet to be arrested  they said. The Arunachal Pradesh government has also decided to temporarily suspend issuing Protected Area Permits (PAPs) to foreigners to check the spread of coronavirus infection  officials familiar with the developments said. Foreigners require PAPs to enter the sparsely populated state that shares a border with China. In an order issued on Friday  chief secretary Naresh Kumar directed all PAP issuing authorities to suspend the issue of the permit immediately till further orders. “The spread of coronavirus in India is primarily from visitors who had a history of travelling abroad or through tourist who had visited India ... In order to prevent the spread of Corona Virus (COVID-19) in Arunachal Pradesh  it has been decided to temporarily suspend issuing of PAP to visit Arunachal Pradesh ” the order stated. While there has been no positive case detected in the north-east’s largest state yet  the ban has been issued as a precautionary measure. Earlier  the Sikkim government announced similar curbs by denying inner line permits (ILPs) to foreigners.  On Friday  one United States (US) national  who had travelled to Assam  tested positive for COVID-19 after he reached Bhutan. This led the Assam government to issue a directive to all the district administration authorities to take preventive measures advised by the Centre. The virus  which first emerged in China last December  has spread to 97 countries and has infected 107 485 people  according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker. So far  the virus has claimed 3 648 lives across the world.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-booked-for-sharing-misleading-info-on-coronavirus/story-5F2mcz6opjqWFVya6J9eUK.html
08/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Corona scare: Poultry biz hit in Punjab,While the price of eggs has seen a 25% dip  raw chicken  which was being sold for ₹220 to ₹250 a kg three weeks ago  now costs ₹100 per kg in wholesale,The poultry business in Punjab has seen a 25% decline following speculations that chicken and eggs are one of the causes for the spread of Coronavirus. Due to this  the price of chicken and eggs has also gone down. While the price of eggs has seen a 25% dip  raw chicken  which was being sold for ₹220 to ₹250 a kg three weeks ago  now costs ₹100 per kg in wholesale. In view of this  poultry farmers are planning to sell poultry products at minimum prices. The farmers even conducted an egg mela in Karnal to encourage people to consume eggs. They are planning a similar programme in Punjab where people will be given away eggs either for free or at minimal rates.  Punjab progressive poultry farmers association president Mohinder Arora said  “Every day 1.1 crore eggs are produced in Punjab  which are then sold to Haryana  Himachal  Jammu and Kashmir  Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  besides Punjab. But ever since coronavirus rumours spread  our business has been badly hit.” He added that they are being forced to cut down on the price as eggs are perishable.  “The situation is slightly better in Jammu and Kashmir but in Punjab  Haryana and Himachal  we are facing losses ” said Arora. Punjab progressive poultry farmers association chairman Sanjiv Bassi said  “Poultry farmers are already facing losses as the rates of feed has been increased. The grains which cost ₹1 500 per 100 kgs increased to ₹2 200 per 100 kgs.” “Earlier  we used to sell eggs and chicken in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  but ever since the government there offered subsidy on start-up poultry business  the number of poultries in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has increased manifold  raising the demand and rates of grain and feed ” said Bassi. Avneet Singh  the owner of A-one Chicken in Jawahar Nagar camp  said that the rumour has hit retail sale of chicken and eggs as. As of now  there is no study that eggs and chicken cause coronavirus. Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Kumar Bagga said people should not fall for myths such as these. “There is nothing to worry and people can consume well-cooked eggs  chicken and non-vegetarian food ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-scare-poultry-biz-hit-in-punjab/story-GMA3UcanaurGjeNmNntUJO.html
08/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,italy,Strict action if travel history not disclosed  warns Kerala amid coronavirus fears,The Health department said failure to inform authorities about travel history and symptoms would be considered a crime  while the state police separately said it was “illegal and punishable” if anyone hid such information.,Taking a serious view of three fresh coronavirus patients not disclosing their Italy visit  the Kerala government on Sunday warned of strict action  including prosecution  against those hiding such travel to affected countries and symptoms of the infection. The Health department said failure to inform authorities about travel history and symptoms would be considered a crime  while the state police separately said it was “illegal and punishable” if anyone hid such information. The warnings came on a day when Kerala reported five fresh cases of cornovirus  including three who had recent travel history to Italy but evaded health screening at the airport on their return about a week ago. The health department directed that those who come from coronavirus-affected nations should inform it at the earliest. “Otherwise  it will be considered as a crime. Those who come from abroad should be in-house surveillance for 28 days ” a release from the health department said. The police said the symptomatic persons should inform the authorities concerned. “It is illegal and punishable” if anyone hid their travel history to the coronavirus-affected countries and did not reveal the symptoms of the virus  if any  a police release said. “Strict action  including prosecution  will be initiated against them. Directives of various government agencies should be followed in this regard ” it added. Kerala was put on high alert after the five fresh cases  which came days after the state had successfully treated the country’s first three coronavirus patients. Health minister K K Shailaja said the three  a couple and their son  had evaded health screening at the airport on their return about a week ago and all the five hail from Ranni in Pathnamthitta district.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/kerala/coronavirus-in-kerala-strict-action-if-travel-history-not-disclosed/story-2gZw8QCr8kgGgguMyr1CdI.html
08/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Combating coronavirus  together  writes Soumya Swaminathan,Prepare for increases  monitor its spread  be open with the people  coordinate all efforts,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease  COVID-19  which began in China in December 2019  has since spread rapidly around the world. The disease has now been detected in more than 75 countries  including India  causing over 3 000 deaths worldwide. It is caused by SARS-like corona virus. Other members of the group cause the common cold.  The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever  fatigue  and a dry cough. Some patients have aches and pains  a sore throat  or diarrhoea. The good news is that for most people  the disease is mild; about 80% will recover from the disease without the need for special treatment. However  older people and those with medical conditions such as high blood pressure  heart disease  and diabetes  may become seriously ill. About 2 to 3% of people with the disease have died. This death rate is much higher than for seasonal influenza (0.1%). Only 2% of confirmed cases have been in children and adolescents of less than 20 years — it is unknown what role children play in transmission of the disease. There are as yet no specific treatments to treat the disease  nor is a vaccine available. Vaccines are in development  but it will be at least 12-18 months before any are ready for use. Many repurposed drugs (including those used to treat HIV  influenza and other viral infections) are undergoing clinical trials  along with adjunctive treatments. Currently  management consists of symptomatic and supportive treatment. India should participate in the research and development effort to develop new tools — diagnostics  vaccines and therapeutics — for this novel virus  as well as contribute to better understanding of its epidemiology and transmission dynamics. The virus appears to spread through droplet transmission. When a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales  small droplets from the nose or mouth land on surfaces and objects around them. When others touch these surfaces and then touch their eyes  nose  or mouth  or they breathe in droplets from an infected person  they can catch the virus.  Fortunately  there are several things people can do to protect themselves. The most important is hand hygiene. People should wash their hands often with soap and water for 20 to 30 seconds; when water is not available  alcohol-based hand rubs should be used.  Stay at least one metre (three feet) away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes  nose  or mouth. Practice good respiratory hygiene; cough or sneeze into a tissue or into your bent elbow. Dispose of used tissues immediately. People who feel unwell should stay at home. People who do not have symptoms do not need to wear a medical mask. But those who do have symptoms and those who are caring for people with symptoms should wear masks. The World Health Organization (WHO) is deeply concerned by disruptions to the global supply of personal protective equipment  including medical masks  gloves  gowns  and aprons. Some of these shortages have been caused by irrational panic buying.  Everyone should follow the latest advice from national and local public health authorities.  What should these authorities be doing now?  All countries  including India  should have already activated their national public health emergency management mechanisms. For many countries  this will mean adapting an existing preparedness plan for influenza pandemics. The Integrated Health Information platform (IHIP) of the ministry of health can be used for epidemiological surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia. Large-scale laboratory testing is critical  as is information sharing. Cases need to be rapidly detected and their contacts comprehensively and rapidly traced. Infection prevention and control practices in health facilities and communities should be reviewed and enhanced where necessary.  Health care facilities and staff should be prepared for large increases in numbers of people with suspected COVID-19. Geographic spread of the virus should be monitored  as well as transmission intensity  disease trends  characterisation of virologic features  and assessment of the impact of the disease on health care services. Information should be available for travellers and staff at points of entry (airports  ports).  One of the most critical things governments can do is to communicate clearly and accurately with the public. People need to understand what public health authorities do and do not know about the disease  and what they are doing to contain it. Clear and consistent messages from trusted experts and community leaders need to be disseminated in local languages. Two-way channels  such as text and telephone hotlines  and social media should be established so the population can get information and ask questions. This is also key to combating the spread of myths and misinformation.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is for public officials to be transparent and open with the public. When citizens believe their government is being candid with them  they are more likely to take protective measures for themselves and their communities. Public health measures need to be tailored to particular situations and be frequently evaluated and updated  based on changing epidemiology. WHO is ready to assist India and all other countries in this outbreak. Technical guidance has been assembled  as well as a freely accessible database of publications on COVID-19. A wealth of resources  including a daily situation report  news releases  summaries of press briefings  and infographics for printing and social-media sharing  is available for the public  policymakers  clinicians  and public health officials. Coordination and collaboration are essential to combat this common threat. As the director general of  WHO Dr Tedros has said “Our greatest enemy right now is not the coronavirus itself. It’s fear  rumours and stigma”. And our greatest assets are facts  reason and solidarity.

The quarantine zones are home to more than 15 million people and include the regions around Venice and financial capital Milan.,A quarter of the Italian population was locked down Sunday as the government takes drastic steps to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus that is sweeping the globe  with Latin America recording its first fatality. Italy has seen the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China  where the outbreak that has now killed more than 3 500 people and infected over 100 000 worldwide began in December. The measures in place until April 3 bar people from entering or leaving vast areas of northern Italy without good reason  according to a decree signed by the prime minister and published online. The quarantine zones are home to more than 15 million people and include the regions around Venice and financial capital Milan  while cinemas  theatres and museums will be closed nationwide. It comes as Argentina on Saturday became the first Latin American country to report a fatality from the virus that has affected 95 nations and territories.  Anxious passengers aboard a virus-hit US cruise ship were confined to their cabins in waters off San Francisco  after 21 people tested positive for the disease. The contagion has already spread to 30 US states  killing at least 19 people  with New York announcing a state of emergency. The Grand Princess ship was given permission late Saturday to dock in Oakland.  Vice President Mike Pence  who is in charge of the US response to the outbreak  said earlier that all 3 533 passengers and crew would be tested for coronavirus and quarantined if necessary. Meanwhile another cruise ship  the Costa Fortuna  was turned away by Malaysia and Thailand due to virus fears  an official said Sunday. The boat is carrying around 2 000 people  including dozens of Italians. - ‘Sombre moment’ - The World Health Organization described worldwide virus cases passing the 100 000-mark as a “sombre moment”. However in China  the number of new cases reported Sunday nationwide was the lowest in weeks  with nearly all 44 of them in Wuhan  the capital of Hubei province and epicentre of the outbreak. The government has hinted it may soon lift the quarantine imposed on Hubei  where some 56 million people have been effectively housebound since late January. The only infections in China beyond Hubei were imported from abroad  including arrivals from Italy and Spain in Beijing. The WHO said the efforts of China and other countries were “demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed” with the path of the disease even “reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities”. As recorded deaths in Italy soared to 233 on Saturday  the Vatican announced Pope Francis’s Angelus prayer -- normally delivered by the 83-year-old pontiff from his window -- would be broadcast as a livestream. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population after Japan  according to the World Bank  and elderly people appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from the virus. Retired doctors are being recruited to bolster the Italian healthcare system  while civil protection officials say Lombardy region is having trouble finding beds in hospitals. - Global spread -  Colombia  Costa Rica  Malta  the Maldives  Bulgaria and Paraguay have also announced their first cases. The number of infections in South Korea passed 7 000 on Saturday -- the highest in the world outside China. Iran’s 21 new deaths from the epidemic and 1 076 fresh cases reported Saturday brought the overall tolls there to 145 dead and 5 823 infected. The virus has hit international business  tourism  and sports events  with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide as schools and universities close. The Scotland-France women’s rugby match scheduled for Saturday in Glasgow was postponed after a Scottish player tested positive for the coronavirus  Scottish Rugby said. Organisers of the Barcelona marathon on Saturday postponed the event  which had been scheduled for March 15  until October 25. And in Canada  the International Ice Hockey Federation called off the Women’s World Ice Hockey Championships  which had been set to run from March 31 to April 10. Saudi Arabia reopened an area in Mecca’s Grand Mosque  Islam’s holiest site  after suspending the year-long umra pilgrimage during which worshippers circle the Kaaba seven times.

Rescuers have also retrieved 38 survivors from the rubble  with five in critical or serious condition  out of 71 initially trapped  the ministry said. The coastal city of Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel had been repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients  the People’s Daily state newspaper reported. Footage circulating on Twitter-like Weibo showed rescue workers searching the ruins of the Xinjia hotel in the dark as they reassured a woman trapped under heavy debris and carried wounded victims to ambulances. Other footage published by local media  purportedly from security cameras across the street  showed the entire hotel collapsing in seconds. The building’s facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground  exposing the structure’s steel frame  and a crowd gathered as the evening wore on. State broadcaster CCTV had earlier reported 48 people had been rescued out of 67 initially trapped when the hotel -- which opened two years ago -- collapsed. The building’s first floor has been undergoing renovation since before the Lunar New Year  and construction workers called the hotel’s owner minutes before the collapse to report a deformed pillar  the official Xinhua news agency said. The building’s owner has been summoned by police  according to Xinhua. China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents that are typically blamed on the country’s rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules. At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou. Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-quarantine-hotel-collapse-kills-four/story-hX3TiVqeVR6FI4VuElmiDK.html

A senior government official hinted on Friday that China may soon lift the lockdown on the province imposed in late January  which has effectively restricted the movement of some 56 million people in Hubei. Nationwide new infections have also been on a downward trend  but confirmed imported cases have prompted fears in recent days that infections could swell as people get infected overseas. The two cases reported in Beijing Sunday were arrivals from Italy and Spain  the capital’s health commission said.

As the outbreak takes root  daily life has become increasingly disrupted  with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online. Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference  a high-profile annual gathering that took place in Maryland last month  said on Saturday one of their attendees had tested positive for the virus after exposure prior to the event. The person had no interactions with President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence  who were in attendance  the American Conservative Union said in a statement. The two latest deaths were in Washington’s King County  the hardest hit area in the United States after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. The first deaths on the East Coast were announced late Friday  with two people succumbing in Florida. In New York  the number of confirmed cases rose by 13 on Saturday to a statewide total of 89 people  Governor Andrew Cuomo said. He issued a declaration of emergency. “It allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring  which is what we need right now ” Cuomo told a news conference.  Kansas  Missouri and Washington DC announced their first cases.  In international waters off California  passengers on a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco after some aboard tested positive for the novel coronavirus did not know on Saturday when they might be able to step ashore. Trump said on Friday he would prefer the Grand Princess’s 2 400 passengers and 1 100 crew remain out at sea  but that he would let others decide where she should dock. After 19 crew and two passengers out of 46 tested on the Grand Princess were found to have the virus  Pence said the ocean liner will be taken to an unspecified non-commercial port where everyone on board will be tested again  and that those “who need to be quarantined will be quarantined” and those who need medical care will receive it. US officials also began tracking another cruise ship that may have shared crew with the Grand Princess or the Diamond Princess  another ship where the coronavirus spread onboard  Pence said. One Grand Princess passenger described a dull and sometimes queasy wait for news of when their limbo would end. “It bugs me that my relatives in the Bay Area know what’s going to happen with us before I do ” Elizabeth Aleteanu of Colorado Springs said in an interview conducted via Facebook. She turned 35 on Wednesday in a small  windowless cabin shared with her husband and two young children  where the rocking of the vessel sometimes left her nauseated. “The cruise director and staff called my phone and sang happy birthday ” she wrote. “They delivered a princess notebook  birthday card  set of dominoes and a flower arrangement to my cabin. I’m not sure that we’re getting off today. It’s a big flower arrangement ... makes me think we’ll be on board for a hot minute.” The ship’s captain had addressed passengers earlier to say he did not know when they could dock  and that one guest who was critically ill on Friday was taken off the ship  Aleteanu said. The ship has increased its offering of television programs to help passengers pass the time  she said. The predicament of the Grand Princess was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess cruise liner  also owned by Carnival Corp  the world’s leading cruise operator. It was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China. Stephen Hahn  the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration  told a news conference at the White House on Saturday that a total of 2.1. million coronavirus tests will have been shipped to non-public labs by Monday  as the Trump administration aims to counter criticism that its response to the disease has been sluggish. Hahn said the focus is on getting tests to the highest risk areas in Washington state and California. Multiple manufacturers will soon send millions more tests  he said. “What they told us is they believe they could scale up by the end of next week ... for the capacity for 4 million additional tests that could be shipped ” Hahn said. The respiratory illness has spread to more than 90 countries  killing more than 3 400 people and infecting more than 100 000 worldwide. The economic damage has also intensified and stock markets have continued to tumble. To mitigate against the virus  some banks in New York are dividing their teams of traders between central locations and secondary sites in New Jersey and Connecticut  according to sources familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs Group Inc had a scare this past week when an employee at its Lower Manhattan offices told the bank he had been at a temple service in a city suburb with a lawyer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The bank said the employee was sent home and has been under self-quarantine since then “out of an abundance of caution.” The employee  however  did not have contact with the lawyer at the service and has not shown any signs of illness  the bank said. He is expected to return to work next week when it would have been two weeks since he attended the service.  Goldman also cleaned the floor on which he worked at its headquarters. All floors remained operational  though Goldman let employees who felt uncomfortable work remotely  it said. “We have no confirmed cases of employees who have contracted COVID-19 and all our buildings are fully operational ” the bank said.

07/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;oman,‘Completely absurd’: China’s coronavirus control tactics trigger outrage among citizens,Ge Daye was also quarantined in his home near Beijing on the orders of local officials -- not because he had travelled to a virus-hit area  but because he was born in Hubei.,An elderly man in virus-hit China pops out to use a public toilet without wearing a compulsory face mask. The next thing he knows  police are ordering him into a van to be taken into quarantine. A video of the incident in the northern province of Hebei has been widely shared on social media amid growing anger over apparently arbitrary measures aimed at stopping the deadly epidemic from spreading. Criticised for their slow response to the virus  which emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December  chastened authorities have gone on the offensive in recent weeks  as the death toll has risen to more than 3 000 with over 80 500 infected in the country. From locking down tens of millions of people at the epicentre of the outbreak to imposing two-week quarantines on anyone who has travelled to virus-affected provinces or countries  officials are pulling out all stops to contain the virus. But there are growing complaints that their efforts are excessive  with neighbourhood committees -- which enforce the orders of the ruling Communist Party -- sometimes accused of going too far. “In my case  they acted in a simplistic and rude manner ” Zhang  a 29-year-old woman in Beijing  told AFP. Zhang was quarantined after her flatmate returned from another province and was banned from even setting foot in the shared corridor. To ensure she obeyed  a notice was stuck on her front door warning neighbours “this person is currently in quarantine. Please watch over them.” “It’s humiliating ” Zhang said. In another case shared on social media  three relatives under lockdown in the hardest-hit province of Hubei were playing mahjong when they were reprimanded by staff enforcing the prevention measures  apparently for being too close to each other. ‘Completely absurd’ Ge Daye was also quarantined in his home near Beijing on the orders of local officials -- not because he had travelled to a virus-hit area  but because he was born in Hubei. “I haven’t been there for six months ” the 29-year-old said. “They say the measure comes from above and admit themselves that it is not good. But the orders are the orders.” “I understand the politicians. They don’t want to bother” sorting out potentially infected people from the rest  he said. But the approach “is completely absurd”. Faced with growing discontent over its handling of the health crisis  the government is taking action. In a recent editorial  the Communist Party’s mouthpiece the People’s Daily warned against the arbitrary implementation of virus measures. “This will inevitably provoke resentment and opposition from the people ” it said. Beijing city officials also noted recently the existence of “certain problems” of abusive procedures and promised to do better. Nearly one million returnees have had to undergo 14-day quarantine in the capital. In collaboration with hundreds of municipalities  tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have launched mobile apps that use metadata to determine if the user should be isolated.

07/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;italy,Coronavirus not declared epidemic in Punjab  clears government,A spokesperson said there was absolutely no epidemic of the disease in the state and the press release issued by the health department on the issue had inadvertently described Covid-19 as an epidemic disease.,The Punjab government has clarified coronavirus has not been declared an epidemic in the state and the health department had merely issued a precautionary advisory under an act  which calls for special measures to prevent an outbreak or spread of any dangerous disease. A spokesperson said there was absolutely no epidemic of the disease in the state and the press release issued by the health department on the issue had inadvertently described Covid-19 as an epidemic disease. The department had issued an advisory under the Epidemic Diseases Act  1897  only as a “temporary regulation” to combat the threat of coronavirus  said the spokesperson  adding there was no cause for panic at present and the situation was totally under control. The spokesperson made it clear that while the advisory notification  listing the preventive and precautionary measures  was issued in line with the decisions taken by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to ensure that the disease does not spread in the state  the government had not taken any decision to declare the disease an epidemic. According to the spokesperson  under the epidemic diseases act all that the government had done was to take a series of preventive initiatives  including screening of suspected cases  recording of travel history in case of travel to country/area where COVID-19 has been reported  and 14-day home quarantine of person with such history found asymptomatic.

07/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,‘It’s pandemonium’: Panic-buying hits Los Angeles amid coronavirus outbreak fears,One person has died so far in California  which as of Friday had registered 69 coronavirus cases -- second in the US only to nearby Washington state.,Sprinting shoppers  rationed mineral water and not a roll of toilet paper to be seen: panic-buying sparked by the new coronavirus soared in Los Angeles this week. Two days after California declared a statewide emergency  wholesale stores visited by AFP on Friday were unable to keep up with soaring demand for a range of staple items  as citizens prepare for the worst. “It’s pandemonium -- our numbers are double the usual ” said Rene  an employee at a Costco supermarket in Burbank. “Today has been out of control. That’s why we’re out of toilet paper  out of almost all water  out of hand sanitizer.” One person has died so far in California  which as of Friday had registered 69 coronavirus cases -- second in the US only to nearby Washington state. Despite officials’ pleas for restraint  Californians have begun emulating the panic-buying seen across swathes of Asia and other regions. “It’s been nuts ” Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday. The same day  police in San Bernardino County  near Los Angeles  were called to one store after customers became enraged by the lack of supplies. On Friday  Costco shoppers were restricted to two crates of water  down from four the previous day. Several tried to ignore the rule and saw their extra waters confiscated at checkout  leading to “some pushing  a little bit ” an attendant said. A worker wheeling an overloaded cart of confiscated bottles back to their shelf was repeatedly stopped by new customers grabbing what they could. Even Costco’s famous free food samples had been suspended for fear of spreading the virus  another employee confirmed. “With the madness here  it’s starting to really set in ” said Lisa Garcia  a 30-year-old retail worker who admitted she was growing seriously worried. “We were thinking of stocking up on paper products  but look at those empty shelves!” she told AFP. At another nearby branch  employees reported shoppers dashing at full pace through the doors as the store opened  desperate to grab supplies. By midday  only expensive sparkling Perrier bottles remained  to the disappointment of several shoppers. But some shoppers  though concerned  managed to see the lighter side of the situation. “I’m guarded ” said emergency responder Andrew  who did not want to give his last name  wheeling a trolley filled with water  paper towels  limes and ginger ale. “I want to make sure we have the essentials -- some mixers  some wines  you know  so if things go bad I can make a drink.” “I’m here just in case the apocalypse is going to happen ” joked Carlos Gonzalez  a 35-year-old student. “I guess they’ve found a good way to sell a lot of stuff.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-pandemonium-panic-buying-hits-los-angeles-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-fears/story-qwdPd56AC9wZSslgCSST2O.html
07/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,ukraine;united states,Trump’s CDC visit raises concerns on US’ ability to tackle coronavirus outbreak,Trump called Washington state’s governor  who is dealing with the most serious outbreak in the nation  a “snake.”,President Donald Trump’s visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday turned into a scattershot defense of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak  veering into political score-settling  exaggerations and talk harking back to his impeachment. With financial markets slowing and the virus spreading  Trump tried once more to quell the growing alarm that has prompted travel to be curtailed and events to be cancelled from coast to coast. But Trump  wearing his “Keep America Great” campaign hat while discussing the global worry  repeatedly detoured from his message of reassurance. Trump called Washington state’s governor  who is dealing with the most serious outbreak in the nation  a “snake.” He said he’d prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they wouldn’t be added to the count for the nation’s total number of infections. And he falsely claimed that a test for the virus was available immediately to all who want it. He also suggested the accuracy of the coronavirus test was “perfect — like the letter was perfect.” With that  Trump was making a comparison to the July phone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his impeachment. Trump  who was acquitted by the Senate last month  has insisted he did nothing wrong. Before departing Washington  Trump signed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response funding bill at the White House and instructed the public: “Be calm. It will go away.” “We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than just about anybody ” Trump said about cases of the virus. But his messaging was more scattered at the CDC  reflective of the on-again  off-again  on-again nature of the trip itself. The White House had announced early Friday that Trump’s trip to the CDC was canceled because of concern about a possible infection there  but that person tested negative and Trump ended up going after all. During his visit to the CDC  Trump touted the ratings of his town hall this week on Fox News and mocked a CNN reporter. He cut off Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar as he tried to counsel Americans to be patient. And despite calling this week for bipartisanship during the crisis  Trump said he told Vice President Mike Pence not to be complimentary during his Thursday meeting with Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington because “he is a snake.” “So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake  OK? Inslee. I said  ‘If you’re nice to him he will take advantage.’ And I would have said no. Let me just tell you: We have a lot of problems with the governor  the governor of Washington. ... So Mike may be happy with him but I’m not.” Trump also insisted that for those concerned about the virus  “Anybody who wants a test  can get a test.” Pence  who chairs the federal coronavirus task force  at a later briefing suggested a timeline of “weeks” before the test would be widely available to the general public. Pence was also asked whether Trump’s comments about Inslee and impeachment raised questions about how seriously the president was taking the virus. The vice president responded  “I promise you  President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.” Inslee tweeted his own response to Trump’s comments: ”It’s important for leaders to speak with one voice. I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page.” Trump also said he talked on the phone with California Gov. Gavin Newsom about the 3 500 people stuck on a cruise ship anchored off the coast of California. He said he’d prefer for the passengers to remain on the ship — in part so they would not count against the total number of victims in the United States. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of the people on that ship ” he said. Trump did say he would defer to the medical experts and Pence later said the ship would be brought to a U.S. port. The legislation Trump signed at the White House provides federal public health agencies with money for vaccines  tests and potential treatments and helps state and local governments prepare and respond to the threat. “It’s an unforeseen problem ” Trump said of the virus. “It came out of nowhere. We’re taking care of it.” The president  while touring the CDC  talked up his ability to understand the virus  although he has repeatedly misstated how long it would take for a vaccine to be developed and available. “I like this stuff. I really get it ” Trump said. “People are surprised that I understand it. ... Maybe I have a natural ability.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-cdc-visit-raises-concerns-on-us-ability-to-tackle-coronavirus-outbreak/story-43RXGwCS8NLODhnV4CC9nL.html

The statement also said ‘darshan’ will resume once the health ministry gives its nod. Foreigners form a major chunk of teeming devotees at the ashram. A senior health ministry official  who did not want to get identified  said an advisory was sent to the ashram after the South Korea incident came to light. In Seoul  a priest of a Christian sect had held a big mass in a closed church which is suspected to have spiked the infections in the country. Later authorities had booked the priest and other office-bearers of the church. In Amma’s ashram (Amritanandamai’s popular name) the main attraction is her ‘darshan’  where she hugs and blesses devotees. Thousands throng the ashram for her ‘darshan and ‘bhajan’ every day. A recipient of many awards including the ‘Gandhi King Award’  Amma’s ashram has branches all over the world. The ‘mutt’ also runs a chain of educational institutions and hospitals.

The dip in tourism is mainly due to the ban on entry of foreigners announced by Sikkim yesterday and by Bhutan on Friday after an American tourist travelling from India was tested positive for the deadly disease after his arrival at Paro  about 50km from capital Thimpu. The Indian state of Sikkim  which shares borders with China  Bhutan and Nepal  had announced on Thursday that it will not issue Inner Line Permit (ILP) to foreigners  including Bhutan nationals.  It also announced a blanket ban to visits to Nathula pass on the Indo-China border. “Following the announcements  more than 1500 tourists who were returning from Phuentsholing  the border town in Bhutan  are facing difficulty ” said Suresh Thakuri  president of Jaigaon Travel Welfare Association. The immigration office at Phuentsholing has been closed  said Sangey Tenzing a Bhutan immigration department official.

06/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;japan;china;italy,Coronavirus in India- Japan concerned at visa restrictions,Japan is also understood to have argued the restrictions would affect the work of Japanese managers in decision-making role and experts and engineers working on Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project.,Japan has expressed concern at visa restrictions imposed by India on its nationals in view of the Coronavirus outbreak  prompting people familiar with developments in New Delhi to say that there is no “political reason” behind the move. The Japanese side  in a demarche or formal diplomatic representation submitted in New Delhi on Wednesday  is understood to have informed the external affairs ministry that the suspension of regular visas  e-visas and visa on arrival facility would especially hamper the operations of Japanese firms in India. The Japanese side contended that India’s decision to lump it with other countries subject to visa restrictions – China  South Korea  Iran and Italy – was not balanced as these nations have recorded far more cases of infections and deaths. It is also understood to have argued the restrictions would affect the work of Japanese managers in decision-making roles and experts and engineers working on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project. The people familiar with developments in New Delhi  who spoke on condition of anonymity  described Tokyo’s response as an over-reaction and said there were no political reasons behind India’s visa restrictions. “The decision was made purely on health grounds by India’s health ministry so that infections don’t spread over a larger area in the country. Other countries too have done the same thing ” said a person. “Others can complain but we are dealing with an epidemic. Japan  too  has taken steps to protect its citizens and didn’t allow those on board the cruise chip Diamond Princess to disembark and be treated in hospitals on the shore ” the person added. The people noted there was no visa ban on nationals of other countries  though procedures had been put in place to ensure all visa applicants can be properly screened. The Indian embassy in Tokyo also tweeted on Friday: “Please rest assured that essential travels  including for business and employment  are being facilitated by @IndianEmbTokyo and @IndianConsOsaka  through a revised visa process available on our website.” On March 3  India had announced that all visas and e-visas issued to citizens of Japan  South Korea  Italy and China before that date had been suspended. The visa on arrival facility for Japanese and South Korean nationals was suspended on February 28. The Japanese side  which is focused on ensuring there is no disruption of economic activities  had pointed out that the total number of infections in Japan as of March 3 was 268 and the number of deaths was six  compared to 80 304 and 2 946 for China  4 812 and 28 for South Korea  and 2 036 and 52 for Italy.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-in-india-japan-concerned-at-visa-restrictions/story-Z92KbPvGkNz0qsOp9WvAtM.html

06/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;italy,Coronavirus epicentre Wuhan could see zero cases by March-end,Two new areas of worry are emerging in China – new cases coming in from abroad and recovered patients relapsing.,The central Chinese city of Wuhan  the epicentre of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could see zero new cases by the end of March  a leading government expert has said  though there was an increase in fresh cases for the second consecutive day. The national health commission (NHC) also announced on Friday that some vaccines against covid-19 could be put to clinical trials or emergency use in April. By the end of Thursday  Hubei reported 29 of the 30 new deaths and 126 of the 143 new infections reported from across China  national health commission (NHC) officials said. The death toll from covid-19 is now 3042 and total infections 80522 in China  the NHC said. All the new infections in Hubei were from Wuhan  and none were reported from other major cities in the province. Taking a cue from the trend  Zhang Boli from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a member of the central government expert group in Wuhan said the provincial capital could see zero new infections by month-end and other cities are likely to report the same by the middle of the month. Zhang was quoted as saying by state media that outside Hubei  people could take off their masks and resume normal life by the end of April. “In Hubei and particularly in Wuhan  however  people will have to wait one additional month. Zero reported new cases is not absolute. Sporadic new cases will emerge ” he said.  Two new areas of worry are emerging in China – new cases coming in from abroad and recovered patients relapsing. On Friday  Shanghai reported three new cases of covid-19 infections  all from Tehran  Iran  taking the total number of such cases to 39. The three infected persons  two from northwest China’s Ningxia and one from Gansu  are studying in Iran. As of Thursday  16 new “imported” cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland  including 11 in Gansu Province  four in Beijing and one in Shanghai. The cases in Beijing were tracked back to Italy. Doctors here are also carefully looking into the cases of relapsed patients. Residents of a building in Xi’an in northwest China’s Shaanxi province have been quarantined for two weeks since Thursday after a recovered COVID-19 patient living in the building again turned positive. A rehabilitation clinic for recovered patients has been opened in Wuhan. According to doctors  the facility is necessary as recovered patients  especially in severe cases  may continue to show symptoms like fatigue and lack of appetite. They are also prone to relapse as their immune system is low. Meanwhile  NHC’s Zheng Zhongwei said Friday that “eight institutions in China were working on developing vaccines along five technical routes”. “Many of them have entered animal trials and the development progress for vaccines in China is similar to somewhat ahead of those in foreign countries ” Zheng was quoted as saying by state-run China Daily.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-could-see-zero-cases-by-march-end/story-w165B8JGmv9VAWpgEE1usO.html
06/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,On scramble for masks  health minister Harsh Vardhan’s advice  and a warning,Since the day the novel strain of coronavirus broke out in Wuhan province of China in December last year  there has been a surge in the demand for masks.,Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on Friday that there is no need to create panic about the need to wear masks  as India has put in place stringent measures to fight the spread of coronavirus. He also said that strict action should be taken against shopkeepers who are charging more than the fixed price for masks. Live Updates: Tackling Coronavirus Spread in India This comes after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Maharashtra started regulating the sale and storage of coronavirus kits to prevent hoarding and overpricing. FDA commissioner Arun Unhale said that the Maharashtra government and FDA had received several complaints of chemists selling PPE kits and N-95 masks at prices higher than the MRP. The FDA directed chemists to sell PPE kits and masks only on doctors’ prescription. This state’s health department had said on Thursday that it said it is not essential for the general population to use masks at the current moment. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had also said that there is no need for panic buying of masks. “People do not need to buy hand sanitisers and masks. The hand sanitiser is not the cure; hand washing for 20 seconds with soap and water is in fact much better. As for masks  only people working in hospitals  caring for those who have Covid-19 need a mask. People in the community do not need it ” Jain had said on Thursday. Since the day the novel strain of the virus broke out in Wuhan province of China in December last year  there has been a surge in the demand for masks which are believed to be effective in controlling the spread of the virus. Many people started wearing masks as a precaution to ward off infection. Members of Parliament have also started wearing masks. In fact  independent member from Maharashtra’s Amravati  Navneet Ravi Rana  on Thursday asked a question in Lok Sabha wearing a mask. Some security staff too were wearing masks and gloves while scanning visitors in Parliament on Thursday. Due to the surge in demand  the price of masks has shot up multiple times as people are resorting to panic buying. “There is panic among the people about coronavirus and demand for masks has increased  due to which the price of them have inflated. The N-95 mask which used to sell at Rs 50-60 but now it has been selling at the rate of Rs 280-300 ” said Mohit Goyal  the treasurer of chemist association in New Delhi’s Nai Basti. The situation is same across the world. South Korea  which has the highest number of infections outside China  announced strict controls on face masks  which have been in such high demand that people have stood in line for hours to buy them. Beginning Friday  exports of masks will be prohibited and South Koreans will be limited to buying two masks a week  and only on specific days determined by the year of their birth. “A new risk is always scarier than one we’re familiar with because it has elements of the unknown ” said David Ropeik  who authored the book “How Risky Is It  Really?” The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also said that people should wear a mask only if they are coughing or sneezing. “Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. If you are healthy  you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection ” the WHO said. Close to one lakh people worldwide have been infected with the novel strain of the coronavirus  the vast majority of them in China where the outbreak originated. More than 3 200 people have died  but 51 000 have recovered after being treated. In India  the number of infected people has reached 31.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-scramble-for-masks-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-s-advice-and-a-warning/story-C2gWVwfCkqo7ZRUCwklOwJ.html

A military helicopter lowered test kits onto the 951-foot (290-meter) Grand Princess by rope as the vessel lay at anchor off the coast of San Francisco  and authorities said the results would be available on Friday. Princess Cruise Lines said fewer than 100 people aboard had been identified for testing. “The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers ” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. The precaution was prompted by the death of a Sacramento-area man who succumbed to the coronavirus after he had been on an earlier sailing of the ship  in February. Two other passengers from that voyage have been hospitalized with the virus in Northern California  and a Canadian man in his 60s who sailed aboard the ship last month tested positive after returning home to an area outside Toronto  officials said.

Colorado and Nevada reported their first cases. Nine of the dead were from the same suburban Seattle nursing home  now under federal investigation. Families of nursing home residents voiced anger Thursday after receiving conflicting information about the condition of their loved ones. One woman was told her mother had died  then got another call from a staffer who said she was doing well  only to find out she had  in fact  died  said Kevin Connolly  whose father is also a resident of the facility. “This is the level of incompetence we’re dealing with ” Connolly said. Around the country  New York’s mayor implored the federal government to send more test kits to his state  which saw its caseload double overnight to 22  all of them in or near the city. In Rhode Island  about 200 people were quarantined because of their connections to a school trip to Italy that has so far resulted in three cases of the coronavirus. Amid four cases in Florida  Gov. Ron DeSantis said the risks remain low for most people planning trips to the state for spring break or baseball’s spring training. On Wall Street  fears about the outbreak led to a sharp selloff  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 970 points  or 3.6 percent. The drop extended two weeks of wild swings in the market  with stocks fluctuating 2 percent or more for the fourth day in a row.

But dozens of passengers have had flu-like symptoms over the past two weeks or so  said Mary Ellen Carroll  executive director of San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management. “Once we have results from the tests ” she said  authorities “will determine the best location for the ship to berth.” Video from the California National Guard showed the helicopter approaching the bow of the ship and lowering three helmeted paratroopers into an empty area with a swimming pool with what appeared to be a freezer chest and other items. The helicopter was scheduled to retrieve the kits later Thursday for delivery to a lab in Richmond  California  authorities said. The test results could be processed in a few hours. The ship was returning to San Francisco after visiting Hawaii. Some of the passengers remained on board after sailing on its previous voyage  to the Mexican ports of Puerto Vallarta  Manzanillo  Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas. A passenger from the Mexico voyage  Judy Cadiz of Lodi  California  said she and her husband became ill afterward but did not given it much thought until learning a fellow traveler had died of the virus. Now they cannot get a straight answer about how to get tested  she said. With Mark Cadiz  65  running a fever  the couple worries not only about themselves  but about the possibility that — if they contracted the infection — they could have passed it on to others. “They’re telling us to stay home  but nobody told me until yesterday to stay home. We were in Sacramento  we were in Martinez  we were in Oakland. We took a train home from the cruise ” Judy Cadiz said Thursday. “I really hope that we’re negative so nobody got infected.” The coronavirus has infected nearly 98 000 people worldwide and killed over 3 300  the vast majority of them in China. U.S. health officials said they expect a far lower death rate than the World Health Organization’s international estimate of 3.4% — a rate admittedly too high because it doesn’t account for mild cases that go uncounted. Assistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir cited a model that included mild cases to say the U.S. could expect a death rate somewhere between 0.1% — like seasonal flu — and 1%. The risk is highest for older people and anyone with conditions such as heart or lung disease  diabetes or suppressed immune systems  such as from cancer treatments. At least 70 coronavirus cases have been reported in Washington state  most them in the Seattle area  where researchers say the virus may have been circulating undetected for weeks. Some major Seattle-area businesses  including Microsoft  Amazon and outdoor gear manufacturer REI  have shut down some operations or urged employees to work from home  while the 22 000-student Northshore district announced it will close for up to two weeks as a precaution. The two tech giants together employ more than 100 000 people in the region. With many commuters off the road  traffic on the Seattle area’s notoriously congested freeways was much lighter Thursday. Seattle’s King County is buying a motel for $4 million to house coronavirus patients and hopes to have the first of them in place within days at the 84-room EconoLodge in Kent  about 20 miles (32 km) from Seattle. The rooms’ doors open to the outside rather than to a central hallway  reducing the likelihood of contact between patients. The plan ran into resistance from local leaders  including Kent Police Chief Rafael Padilla  who called it “ill-advised and dangerous” and warned: “At any point a patient can simply walk into our community and spread the virus.” Federal health authorities have launched an investigation of the nursing home at the epicenter of the nation’s worst outbreak  the Life Care Center in Kirkland  to determine whether it followed guidelines for preventing infections. Last April  the state fined it $67 000 over infection-control deficiencies after two flu outbreaks.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cruise-ship-is-held-off-california-coast-for-coronavirus-testing/story-QVrRfDTkdi008YmVmhvu7M.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders said they wouldn’t attend Holi events and the Holi Moo Festival in New Delhi was cancelled.,The global march of the new virus triggered a vigorous appeal Thursday from the WHO for governments to pull out “all the stops” to slow the epidemic  as it drained colour from India’s spring festivities  closed Bethlehem’s Nativity Church and blocked Italians from visiting elderly relatives in nursing homes. As China  after many arduous weeks  appeared to be winning its epic  costly battle against the new virus  the fight was revving up in newly affected areas of the globe  unleashing disruptions that profoundly impacted billions of people. The UN health agency urged all countries to “push this virus back ” a call to action reinforced by figures showing about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it. The virus has infected nearly 98 000 people and killed over 3 300. “This is not a drill. This is not the time for giving up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops ” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. “Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans.” As Chinese manufacturers gradually reopened their factories  anti-virus barriers went up elsewhere.

Italy’s sports-mad fans are also barred from stadiums until April 3. A government decree that took effect Thursday urged the country’s famously demonstrative citizens to stay at least 1 meter (3 feet) apart from each other  placed restrictions on visiting nursing homes and urged the elderly not to go outside unless absolutely necessary. That directive appeared to be widely ignored  as school closures nationwide left many Italian children in the care of their grandparents. Parks in Rome overflowed with young and old  undercutting government efforts to shield older Italians from the virus that hits the elderly harder than others. Italy has the world’s oldest population after Japan. “It’s an absolute paradox!” said Mauro Benedetti  a 73-year-old retiree called upon to watch his grandson. “They tell us to stay home. How can we help our kids and grandkids at the same time?” “Grandparents are now at risk ” he said. Italy’s death toll climbed Thursday to 148  and its confirmed cases to 3 858. Iran  which has registered 107 virus deaths  also closed schools and universities and introduced checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. Iranians were urged to reduce their use of paper money. Iranian state TV also reported that Hossein Sheikholeslam  a 68-year-old diplomat who was an adviser to Iran’s foreign minister  had died of the virus.

Virus fears also affected the joyful celebration of Holi  in which Hindu revelers celebrate the arrival of spring with bursts of colour  including bright powders smeared on faces. Prime Minister Narendra  and other leaders said they wouldn’t attend Holi events and the Holi Moo Festival in New Delhi was cancelled. In the United States  where 12 have died from the virus  hundreds were placed in self-quarantines due to cases in a New York suburb. A suburban Seattle school district with 22 000 students announced it would close for up to two weeks because of coronavirus concerns and Seattle’s normally clogged highways were nearly vacant for Thursday’s morning commute as large tech employers like Amazon encouraged employees to work from home.

Outbreak fears led to a sharp US stock selloff  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 969 points  or 3.6 percent  nearly wiping out gains from a day earlier. Analysts said more yo-yo moves on global markets are likely while new infections accelerate. The OPEC oil cartel called for a deep production cut to keep crude prices from falling further as disruption to global business from the coronavirus slashes demand from air travel and industry — deciding Thursday to push for a cut of 1.5 million barrels a day  or about 1.5% of total world supply. Across the globe  travellers faced ever-greater disruptions  as countries sought to keep the virus out. But South Africa confirmed its first case Thursday  becoming the seventh African nation to report infections. Britain and Switzerland reported their first coronavirus deaths. “The virus doesn’t care about race and belief or color. It is attacking us all  equally ” said Ian MacKay  who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia. The outlook for the travel industry was increasingly grim. The International Air Transport Association said the outbreak could cost airlines as much as $113 billion in lost revenue. The struggling British airline Flybe collapsed Thursday amid sinking demand. Australia  Indonesia  and the United Arab Emirates were among the countries banning entry from people coming from countries that had outbreaks. Germany’s Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Swiss said they will cancel all flights to and from Israel for three weeks starting Sunday after Israeli authorities announced tough restrictions on travelers from several countries because of the new virus. Palestinian officials closed the storied Church of the Nativity in the biblical city of Bethlehem indefinitely  weeks ahead of the busy Easter holiday. Japan said visitors from China and South Korea would face a two-week quarantine at a government facility and be barred from public transit. Sri Lankans arriving from Italy  South Korea and Iran will be quarantined at a hospital once used for leprosy patients. In China  where hospitals were releasing hundreds of recovered patients  officials reported 139 new infection cases and 31 more deaths.

It forecast Australian growth to slow sharply to 1.2% from an already below-trend 2.2% in 2019. Japan would take 0.5 percentage point hit and Korea a 1 percentage point knock.,A fast spreading coronavirus outbreak could knock $211 billion off the combined economies of the Asia-Pacific  with Japan  Hong Kong  Singapore and Australia among the most exposed  S&P Global Ratings said on Friday. S&P cut its 2020 growth forecast for China to 4.8% from previous estimate of 5.7%. It forecast Australian growth to slow sharply to 1.2% from an already below-trend 2.2% in 2019. Japan would take 0.5 percentage point hit and Korea a 1 percentage point knock. “The balance of risks remains to the downside due to local transmission  including in economies with low reported cases  secondary transmissions in China as people return to work and tighter financial conditions ” S&P said in a report. In other forecasts  Hong Kong’s economy would likely contract by -0.8% in 2020  Singapore’s would flat line  and Thailand’s expansion likely slow to 1.6%. The coronavirus epidemic  which emanated from China’s Hubei province  has claimed more than 3 000 lives worldwide in less than three months  prompting monetary policy easings in major economies including the United States. S&P did not cut growth forecasts for emerging markets of Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines and India  citing the fact that reported infections in those countries were still low. However  it noted the outlook could quickly deteriorate if the low level of cases was due to minimal testing and if those countries were swept up in financial contagion. “We have already had a taster of what can happen with overshooting exchange rates in response to a pick-up in world’s fear gauge ” it said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/coronavirus-could-erase-211-billion-from-asia-pacific-economies-s-p/story-ExWan85IqKmyeLD2fEoPKI.html
06/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Indian households lack proper hand-wash facilities  shows data,The survey covered at least 600 000 households across India. Other than interviewing members of the households  the enumerators were tasked with seeing the place where members  of the household most often wash their hands.,As the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases detected in India rises  experts have suggested frequent handwashing as an important precautionary measure. But getting people to follow this routine may not be very easy as a significant number of Indian households do not have adequate handwashing facilities  according to data from the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) . The survey covered at least 600 000 households across India. Other than interviewing members of the households  the enumerators were tasked with seeing the place where members  of the household most often wash their hands. The enumerators could find a designated place for washing hands in about 97% of households surveyed but not all of them with adequate cleaning facilities. Water was not available in 14% of these households at the place where hands were washed. In urban areas  the share of such households was only 6% compared to 18% in rural areas. To be sure  among the households that had water  about 19% had no cleaning agent such as soap  ash  mud or sand. Richer households have better cleaning facilities. The difference is quite significant – among the wealthiest 20% households in the country  water was not available at the place of washing hands in only 1% households  while among the poorest 20% households  water was not available in 32%.  As these figures vary with the class background of people  it also means that the poorer states of India have a higher share of households with poor handwashing facilities. The survey data shows that at least  40% households in Odisha and Jharkhand did not have water available at the place of washing hands  the highest among all states. Chandigarh and Punjab fared the best . In the national capital New Delhi  9% households had no water available at the place of washing hands.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-households-lack-proper-hand-wash-facilities-shows-data/story-2AR6NTqgKyOrTkffaFVhXO.html

The proposed summit was under a cloud because the European Parliament is expected to vote on a resolution critical of India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) later this month.,India and the European Union (EU) on Thursday announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Brussels for a summit meeting  expected to be held next week  would be rescheduled in view of precautionary measures related to the Coronavirus outbreak. Modi had been expected to visit Brussels for the India-EU Summit to be held on March 13. The announcement came a day after the European Defence Agency (EDA) confirmed that one of its staffers tested positive for the novel coronavirus and cancelled all meetings to be held at its premises until March 13. The proposed summit was under a cloud because the European Parliament is expected to vote on a resolution critical of India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) later this month. The resolution was debated in January but a vote was deferred – a move that was seen as being aimed at allowing the summit to go ahead smoothly. External affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar told a news briefing that India and the EU  agreed “it would be wise to reschedule the summit to a later mutually convenient date” as health authorities had advised against travel between regions. “The decision has been taken in the spirit of the close cooperation between India and the EU  who share the same concerns and commitment to global health and hope that the (Covid-19) outbreak is contained soon ” he said. A statement issued by the EU said the two sides jointly decided to postpone the summit because of “precautionary measures related to the global spread of Covid-19”. It added  “In the meantime  we will continue work on our joint agenda to make progress across all aspects of our relations.” The EDA official who contracted the virus visited Italy last week. After returning to Brussels  he met at least 30 officials from other EU bodies. He began feeling sick on February 29 and tested positive for COVID-19  reports said. The European Parliament resolution  figured in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s discussions when he visited Brussels last month and interacted with EU officials to explain India’s position on the CAA and related issues. The resolution agreed on by six of the largest political groups in the European Parliament stated that the law is “discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive” and called on the Indian government to repeal “discriminatory amendments”. India insisted the law is an internal matter but also said it was willing to engage with the members of the European Parliament on the issue. The CAA is aimed at fast-tracking the grant of Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Muslim-majority Afghanistan  Bangladesh and Pakistan. It has drawn flak domestically and overseas for perceived religious discrimination and for diluting India’s secular ethos by tying citizenship to religion.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eu-india-meet-delayed-over-coronavirus-fears/story-Uz9NKCVMcaaQpl3NdOVjxH.html

A RATP union official said the woman had taken part in an evangelical rally last month in the eastern city of Mulhouse  where officials have said several other participants had come down with the disease.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-six-92-new-cases/story-mWeVXVQjjAARYV9ipNaoBP.html

05/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,hong kong,Dogs  cats can’t pass on coronavirus  but can test positive,That’s the conclusion of Hong Kong’s Agriculture  Fisheries and Conservation Department after a dog in quarantine tested weakly positive for the virus Feb. 27  Feb. 28 and March 2  using the canine’s nasal and oral cavity samples.,Pet cats and dogs cannot pass the new coronavirus on to humans  but they can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owners. That’s the conclusion of Hong Kong’s Agriculture  Fisheries and Conservation Department after a dog in quarantine tested weakly positive for the virus Feb. 27  Feb. 28 and March 2  using the canine’s nasal and oral cavity samples. Scientists suspect the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease originated in bats before passing it on to another species  possibly a small wild mammal  that passed it on to humans. However  experts from the School of Public Health of The University of Hong Kong  the College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have unanimously agreed that the dog has a low-level of infection and it is “likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission.” In general  pet owners should maintain good hygiene  including washing hands before and after handling animals  their food and supplies and no kissing them. People who are sick should avoid contact with pets and a veterinarian’s advice should be sought if changes in a pet’s health conditions are detected. “Apart from maintaining good hygiene practices  pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets ” the spokesman said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dogs-cats-can-t-pass-on-coronavirus-but-can-test-positive/story-cZ6b6KCt3RMRsK7DVSUlYO.html

Maharashtra government announced the launch of a dedicated helpline number 020-26127394  which can be accessed 24X7 by residents who want to report a suspected case or symptoms of the infection that has been detected in 30 people across the country so far. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also announced the launch of a four-digit 24x7 helpline number—1916-- to report coronavirus cases in the city. The announcements come on a day when the chief minister  Uddhav Thackeray  assured people about the state’s readiness and said they must not panic. “No need for people to panic and wear masks ” PTI quoted Uddhav Thackeray as saying  on Thursday evening. Uddhav said there were no positive cases in Maharashtra but the state needed to be on alert for the next couple of weeks- the period over which the symptoms of the virus are believed to appear after contracting infection. “Municipal corporations & administration of the state are on alert. We have to be more careful in the next 10 to 15 days. Uddhav also invoked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name to advise people to celebrate Holi in a subdued manner while avoiding big gatherings. Earlier in the day  Uddhav had assured worried lawmakers in the state assembly over the threat posed by the virus.  “I want to appeal to people that do not panic due to this  we had also tackled swine flu earlier in the state. Just stick to the precaution advisory issued by the government ” he had said in the assembly. The chief minister said that the strength of the medical staff conducting thermal screening at the airports in the state will be increased. In order to spread awareness about the disease that has now inflicted several countries in the world after originating from China’s Wuhan province  the Mumbai municipality has decided to put up hoardings disseminating information on fighting the disease as per WHO guidelines at important places like roads and outside schools. Uddhav had earlier in the day told MLAs that he was monitoring the situation with daily review meetings with the health department. “Earlier we had only one centre for the coronavirus test in Pune NIV now  this has been increased to Nagpur and Pune  so now  we have three such centres in Maharashtra ” he had said. He added that all the private hospitals had been instructed to make isolation wards for coronavirus patients.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-prepares-for-coronavirus-threat-with-launch-of-two-24x7-helplines/story-gdU4KdLzV4Ude6QhRICNnJ.html
05/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china,Wuhan doctor recounts fears and hope at coronavirus frontline,Chinese health authorities and a team of WHO experts say that at least 3 000 Chinese medical workers have caught coronavirus -- mostly in Wuhan -- and at least 11 have lost their lives.,One month after makeshift hospitals opened to chaos and confusion at the epicentre of China’s coronavirus epidemic  frontline doctor Ma Yonggang is finally seeing more empty beds as fewer patients arrive. When 43-year-old Ma was first summoned to a sports stadium converted into a medical facility on February 4  it was a virtual construction site with electrical wiring and beds still being installed. Separated from his wife and young child who had returned to eastern Shandong province for Lunar New Year  Ma said he felt “scared and anxious” when the call from the jury-rigged Wuchang hospital came in the middle of the night. But the situation has slowly improved  with the number of patients receiving treatment in the improvised hospital declining from a high of 760 in mid-February to 320 earlier this week. “Now  we admit very few new patients and about three to four recovered patients are discharged each day.” The situation Ma described tallies with officials’ accounts of a slowdown in new infections in Wuhan  an industrial city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have emerged at a market that sold wild animals. It was not always like this. AFP saw people standing in line for hours to see doctors in Wuhan’s hospitals during the first weeks of the crisis  when the facilities lacked enough beds for the thousands of new patients. Conditions ‘were quite bad’  Hastily converted from sports stadiums  schools and cultural venues  Wuhan’s 16 makeshift “ark” hospitals were designed to ease the burden on the city’s overstretched healthcare system. But in the early stages of the outbreak  they also suffered from the same widespread shortages of medical protective supplies as the city’s designated hospitals  Ma said. The hospitals offer basic treatment and diagnosis for patients with mild to moderate symptoms  as well as simple recreational facilities.  “When the hospital was opened  the facilities were only for controlling the outbreak  so the living conditions for patients and medical staff ... were quite bad ” he said in the interview arranged by the State Council’s information office. “Now  the conditions have improved a lot  for example now we have patient exercise areas and bathrooms  and we have indoor heating and catering services.”  Ma admitted that conditions fell short of patients’ expectations and those hoping for small rooms to themselves were not prepared for the open-plan layout of the makeshift hospital. “Once they arrived  they realised that there were several patients in a large open room and began to doubt whether they could be treated successfully ” he said. Mourning fallen doctors More than 80 000 people have been infected and more than 3 000 killed by the new coronavirus in mainland China  with the majority in Wuhan. Chinese health authorities and a team of World Health Organization experts say that at least 3 000 Chinese medical workers have caught the virus -- mostly in Wuhan -- and at least 11 have lost their lives.  But according to Ma  none of the medical workers at the city’s makeshift hospitals have been infected. The death last month of whistleblower Li Wenliang  a 34-year-old Wuhan ophthalmologist who was punished for trying to alert people to the outbreak in December  unleashed a torrent of grief and anger at the authorities. “We felt extremely sad at his death ” Ma said. “We will always mourn (Li and the other fallen doctors)  and we must learn from them and dedicate ourselves even more to fighting the virus.” One of the latest victims was Li’s colleague  Mei Zhongming  who was deputy director of ophthalmology department at the central hospital and died from the virus on Tuesday. While Ma said he was nervous about the possibility of infection  he remained committed to his duties. “As Wuhan medical workers  this historic responsibility has fallen on our shoulders ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-doctor-recounts-fears-and-hope-at-coronavirus-frontline/story-WCGC2tBkgtG4I6YsyPnpTO.html

05/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,Britain moves into second phase of coronavirus battle plan,The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages - containing the novel coronavirus  delaying its transmission  researching its origins and mitigating its impact.,Britain is moving into the second of four phases in its battle plan against coronavirus  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Thursday  after confirmed cases jumped across the country. Britain has so far registered 90 cases of coronavirus  also known as COVID-19  which started in China  but has held off from introducing measures to restrict movement or to cancel events for fear of hurting the economy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is optimistic that Britain is well prepared to cope with the spread of the virus  but early on Thursday regional airline Flybe became one of the first big corporate casualties of the outbreak. The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages - containing the virus  delaying its transmission  researching its origins and mitigating its impact. Whitty  questioned by lawmakers  said Britain had mainly moved into the second stage of delaying transmission and was now considering measures to try to reduce the peak of an epidemic which officials are anticipating in the coming weeks. “The original plan ... was very much predicated on the idea of ‘if it could be controlled in China and contained everywhere else  this virus might go away’. I think the chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero ” Whitty said. “As time goes by  we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions ... We’ve moved from a situation where we were mainly in contain ... to now we’re basically mainly delay.” The government has said it could encourage home-working  cancel large-scale gatherings and possibly close schools to slow the spread of the disease and delay the peak of the outbreak until summer  when the health service is under less pressure. Whitty also said  with older people more vulnerable to the virus  there may be measures to encourage them to stay away from public places  such as the upper house of parliament  the House of Lords. But so far  the government has refrained from triggering those measures  with Whitty saying health officials would present ministers with various options for them to decide what combination would be a “sensible response”.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-moves-into-second-phase-of-coronavirus-battle-plan/story-acsbszmSUPXlcycMCZ88JO.html

More than 95 000 people have been infected and over 3 200 have died worldwide from the virus  which by Thursday had reached some 80 countries and territories. In California  Governor Gavin Newsom declared an emergency following the state’s first coronavirus fatality -- raising the US death toll to 11 -- and a cruise ship was kept offshore after passengers and crew members developed symptoms. Switzerland reported on Thursday its first death from the outbreak  a 74-year-old woman  while Bosnia confirmed its first two cases. The vast majority of global deaths and infections are in China  where the virus first emerged late last year  prompting the country to quarantine entire cities  temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely. As the virus has spread  other countries have also implemented extraordinary measures  with UNESCO saying Wednesday that 13 countries have closed schools  affecting 290.5 million children  while nine others have implemented localised closures. While temporary school closures during crises are not new  UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said  “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and  if prolonged  could threaten the right to education.” Italy on Wednesday ordered schools and universities shut until March 15  ramping up its response as the national death toll rose to 107  the deadliest outbreak outside China. South Korea -- second to China in terms of infections with cases jumping past 6 000 on Thursday -- has postponed the start of the next term until March 23. In Japan  nearly all schools are closed after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for classes to be cancelled through March and spring break  slated for late March through early April. Schools have also shut in Iran  where 92 people have died from the disease. Economic threat  The German health minister said the outbreak was now a “global pandemic” -- a term the World Health Organization has stopped short of using -- meaning the virus is spreading in several regions through local transmission. Thousands of people were stranded on the Grand Princess off the California coast Wednesday as officials delayed its return to carry out tests on people on board. A 71-year-old man who had been aboard the same ship during its previous voyage to Mexico died after contracting COVID-19. The vessel belongs to Princess Cruises  the same company which operated a coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month on which more than 700 people on board tested positive  with six dying from the disease. Infections are now rising faster abroad than they are in China  where 31 more deaths and 139 new cases were reported Thursday. China’s toll now stands at 3 012  with over 80 000 infections. AFP reporters even saw a handful of people trickling back into Wuhan  the quarantined city at the centre of the epidemic  at the train station this week. Beijing is now concerned about importing cases  with 20 infections brought from abroad so far -- prompting several cities to require people arriving from hard-hit countries to go into self-quarantine. Japan announced Thursday that a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping this spring has been postponed because containing the epidemic was “the biggest challenge” for the two countries. Stock markets have rumbled over fears of recession  but Asian shares rallied on Thursday after a surge on Wall Street buoyed by global stimulus measures. The IMF said it was making $50 billion in aid available for low-income and emerging-market countries to fight the epidemic  which it sees as a “serious threat” that would slow global growth to below last year’s 2.9 percent. “At a time of uncertainty... it is better to do more than to do not enough ” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said. In the United States  lawmakers reached a deal to provide more than $8 billion to fight the outbreak.  No kissing  Governments are scrambling to contain the spread of the virus. Japan will quarantine all arrivals from China and South Korea for two weeks  the Yomiuri daily reported  without specifying when the measures will take effect. Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round Islamic “umrah” pilgrimage  an unprecedented move that raises fresh uncertainty over the annual hajj. New measures in Italy -- where 11 towns with 50 000 have been under quarantine -- include a month-long nationwide ban on fan attendance at sports events  and advising people to avoid greetings like kissing on the cheek or shaking hands. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy could contain the outbreak for now  but if there is “exponential growth  not just Italy but any other country in the world would not be able to manage the situation”.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/290-million-students-out-of-school-as-global-coronavirus-battle-intensifies/story-oLywizlb9tKc6IzxcgqPDK.html

Globally  it is estimated to have killed 3.4 percent of those who have contracted the virus. More than 95 000 people have been infected and over 3 200 have died worldwide from the virus  which by Thursday had reached some 80 countries and territories. To date  Switzerland has registered 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the disease first surfaced in the country on February 25. Switzerland on Friday suspended all events with more than 1 000 participants until March 15  notably cancelling the Geneva International Motor Show. On Thursday  the International Labour Organization said that it had decided to cancel a meeting of its governing body  which had been expected to draw around 500 people from more than 70 countries this month  after conducting a risk assessment. The United Nations’ European headquarters in Geneva has also closed its doors to visitors and has curbed some activities linked to the Human Rights Council.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-reports-first-coronavirus-death/story-YD6mz9uCil7GFvpxhfLpqM.html

As of now  the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country stands at 29  including 16 Italian tourists. The figure includes the first three cases in the country from Kerala last month. The three patients have since recovered. Screening of all foreign nationals has been mandated since March 4 and has started in most airports from Wednesday evening. The process should stabilise by Thursday with additional staff being provided by the states  the ministry said in a statement. “Since  in addition to COVID 19 cases related to travel  some cases of community transmission have also been observed  it has been decided to involve district collectors and states have been asked to form rapid response teams as the district  block and village levels ” the ministry said. A total of 3 542 samples have been sent for testing  of which 29 have been found to be positive for COVID-19 till now. Testing of 92 samples is in process and 23 samples are being reconfirmed  the statement said. Private sector will also be engaged for COVID-19 management. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan will hold a meeting with key partners in the evening.   Fourteen Italians  who tested positive for coronavirus and were quarantined at an ITBP facility in Chhawla  have been shifted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-health-ministry-asks-states-to-form-rapid-response-teams-to-stop-community-transmission/story-2wGL204X70wPF9kM6WfB2I.html

The WHO  in its new coronavirus disease situation report  said that the number of confirmed cases outside of China had risen by 2 103 to 12 668 in 76 countries  reported Sputnik. It said the death toll outside of China had gone up by 48 to 214. While Spain  Chile  Poland  Hungary  and the Faroe Islands have reported their first cases of coronavirus  the number of people infected in Iran has increased from 2 336 to 2 922  with the death toll reaching 92.  A dog of an infected person in Hong Kong has tested positive for the disease  which means the virus is likely to be transmitted from humans to animals. Hence  all pets of coronavirus patients in Hong Kong will now be quarantined for two weeks  starting Friday.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-outside-of-china-exceed-12-600-who/story-Oo0LGXBWhxHuULw3uX1EzH.html

More than 95 000 people have been infected and over 3 200 have died worldwide from the virus  which has now reached some 80 countries and territories. The vast majority of global deaths and infections are in China  where the virus first emerged late last year  prompting the country to quarantine entire cities  temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely. As the virus spread  other countries have also implemented extraordinary measures  with UNESCO saying Wednesday that 13 countries have closed schools  affecting 290.5 million children  while nine others have implemented localised closures. While temporary school closures during crises are not new  UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said  “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and  if prolonged  could threaten the right to education.”   Italy on Wednesday ordered schools and universities shuttered until March 15  ramping up its response as the national death toll rose to 107  the deadliest outbreak outside China. South Korea -- the country with the largest number of cases outside China with nearly 6 000 -- has postponed the start of the current term until March 23. In Japan  nearly all schools are closed after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for classes to be cancelled through March and spring break  slated for late March through early April. Some 120 schools closed in France this week in areas with the largest numbers of infections. The German health minister said the outbreak was now a “global pandemic” -- a term the World Health Organisation has stopped short of using  meaning the virus is spreading in several regions through local transmission. Infections are now rising faster abroad than they are in China  where 31 more deaths and 139 new cases were reported Thursday.    China’s death toll now stands at 3 012  with over 80 000 infections. From western Europe to eastern Asia  supermarket shelves have been stripped of supplies in recent weeks  including toilet paper and hand sanitiser. American businesses are increasingly concerned over access to goods and the overall economic outlook is more uncertain  the US Federal Reserve said in its beige book survey released on Wednesday. With the US toll rising to 11 on Wednesday  lawmakers in Congress reached a deal to provide more than USD 8 billion to fight the outbreak. The virus impact has spread beyond supply chains -- stock markets have rumbled as warnings from financial bodies mount that countries could be pushed into recession. The IMF said the epidemic posed a “serious threat” and would slow global growth to below last year’s 2.9 per cent. “At a time of uncertainty... it is better to do more than to do not enough ” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said. The epidemic “is a global problem calling for global response ” she said. Eurozone ministers agreed after a meeting that they were ready to “use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong  sustainable growth”. As the virus continues its march across the world  governments are scrambling to tighten prevention efforts. Italy has seen its outbreak swell despite tough measures  including a quarantine of 11 towns with 50 000 people. New measures include a month-long nationwide ban on fan attendance at sports events  as well as advising people to avoid greetings like kissing on the cheek or shaking hands. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti said the country could tackle the outbreak as long as it remained contained. “But in case of exponential growth  not just Italy but any other country in the world would not be able to manage the situation ” he said. In Iran  where 92 people have died from the disease  schools have been shut and major cultural and sporting events suspended. Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage  an unprecedented move that raises fresh uncertainty over the annual hajj. Countries also continue to crack down on international travel. Israel extended its mandatory quarantine measures -- already in place for travellers from Italy and some Asian countries -- to cover people from France  Germany  Spain  Austria and Switzerland. Even cinemagoers were not immune from the effects of the virus -- the producers of the latest James Bond film pushed back the release of the forthcoming “No Time To Die” from April to November.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/290-million-students-out-of-school-as-global-coronavirus-battle-intensifies/story-30YzElDyUlDepCOW2ujMPN.html
05/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;indonesia;japan;china;united states,India among 15 most affected economies due to coronavirus with trade impact of $348 million: UN,The trade impact for India is less as compared to other economies such as EU  the US  Japan and South Korea.  Trade impact for Indonesia is 312 million dollars.,The trade impact of the coronavirus epidemic for India is estimated to be about 348 million dollars and the country figures among the top 15 economies most affected as slowdown of manufacturing in China disrupts world trade  according to a UN report. Estimates published by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Wednesday said that the slowdown of manufacturing in China due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is disrupting world trade and could result in a 50 billion dollar decrease in exports across global value chains. The most affected sectors include precision instruments  machinery  automotive and communication equipment.   Among the most affected economies are the European Union (USD 15.6 billion)  the United States (USD 5.8 billion)  Japan (USD 5.2 billion)  South Korea (USD 3.8 billion)  Taiwan Province of China (USD 2.6 billion) and Vietnam ( USD 2.3 billion). India is among the 15 most affected economies due to the coronavirus epidemic and slow down in production in China  with a trade impact of 348 million dollars.   The trade impact for India is less as compared to other economies such as EU  the US  Japan and South Korea.  Trade impact for Indonesia is 312 million dollars.  For India  the trade impact is estimated to be the most for the chemicals sector at 129 million dollars  textiles and apparel at 64 million dollars  automotive sector at 34 million dollars  electrical machinery at 12 million dollars  leather products at 13 million dollars  metals and metal products at 27 million dollars and wood products and furniture at 15 million dollars. “Besides its worrying effects on human life  the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential to significantly slowdown not only the Chinese economy but also the global economy. China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations. Any disruption of China’s output is expected to have repercussions elsewhere through regional and global value chains ” UNCTAD said. Over the last month  China has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) to 37.5  its lowest reading since 2004.   This drop implies a 2 per cent reduction in output on an annual basis.  This has come as a direct consequence of the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). “The 2 per cent contraction in China’s output has ripple effects through the global economy and thus far has caused an estimated drop of about USD 50 billion across countries ”UNCTAD said.   “The most affected sectors include precision instruments  machinery  automotive and communication equipment ” it added. UNCTAD said because China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations  a slowdown in Chinese production has repercussions for any given country depending on how reliant its industries are on Chinese suppliers.  “In addition to grave threats to human life  the coronavirus outbreak carries serious risks for the global economy ” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said. “Any slowdown in manufacturing in one part of the world will have a ripple effect in economic activity across the globe because of regional and global value chains ” he said. Pamela Coke-Hamilton  who heads UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities  said for developing economies that are reliant on selling raw materials  the effects could be felt “very  very intensely.”  “Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short-term  it’s likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn ” she said. The estimated global effects of COVID-19 are subject to change depending on the containment of the virus and or changes in the sources of supply. Meanwhile  the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus as UN economists announced a likely USD 50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone. Highlighting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the epidemic  in which there have been more than 90 000 confirmed cases in more than 70 countries (the majority in China) and over 3 000 deaths  Coke-Hamilton said that US measures “in terms of visitor arrivals  cancelling various meetings” were having a “knock-on effect” in terms of demand. “So right now  we’re not clear on where it will go – a lot will depend on what happens with COVID-19; if they are able to come up with a vaccine then hallelujah  hopefully it will end very quickly  but if not  the impact can be severe ” she said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-among-15-most-affected-economies-due-to-coronavirus-with-trade-impact-of-348-million-un/story-jO2pqAxumCULWGtR6XXzsO.html
05/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;italy;japan;singapore,Coronavirus: Global economy is gripped by rare twin supply-demand shock,The supply-cum-demand blows explain why the world economy is sliding toward its weakest expansion since the 2009 recession  with policy makers’ inflation targets becoming all the more unreachable.,The coronavirus is delivering a one-two punch to the world economy  laying it low for months to come and forcing investors to reprice equities and bonds to account for lower company earnings. From one side  the epidemic is hammering the capacity to produce goods as swathes of Chinese factories remain shuttered and workers housebound. That’s stopping production of goods there and depriving companies elsewhere of the materials they need for their own businesses. That supply shock was initially viewed as a short-term disruption  easily reversed once the virus was brought under control. Hence the initial predictions that global growth would follow a V-shaped trajectory  sliding in the first quarter and rebounding in subsequent weeks. Those early bets for 2020 are now in tatters because demand is slumping too. With the virus no longer contained to China  increasingly worried consumers everywhere are reluctant to shop  travel or eat out. As a result  companies are likely not only to send workers home  but to cease hiring or investing -- worsening the hit to spending. How the two shocks will reverberate has sparked some debate among economists  with Harvard University Professor Kenneth Rogoff writing this week that a 1970s style supply-shortage-induced inflation jolt can’t be ruled out. The bottom line for central banks and governments is that there’s likely to be even more pressure to deliver economic fixes. “A classic recession involves a shortfall of demand relative to supply ” said David Wilcox  a former Federal Reserve official now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “In that more ordinary situation  economic policy makers know how to help fill in the missing demand. But this case is more complicated because it involves negative hits to both supply and demand.” The supply-cum-demand blows explain why the world economy is sliding toward its weakest expansion since the 2009 recession  with policy makers’ inflation targets becoming all the more unreachable. Companies including Hyatt Hotels Corp. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. have withdrawn their earnings outlooks  while manufacturers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Toyota Motor Corp. are battling to get production back online. Limited Effectiveness Those body blows explain why the Federal Reserve’s biggest cut to interest rates since 2008  in an emergency move Tuesday  initially failed to spur the equity market. Rogoff’s warning on product shortages notwithstanding  traders are now pricing inflation over the coming 10 years at just 1.48%  down from 1.80% at the start of 2020  Treasury securities show. For central banks  the worry is that rate cuts won’t reopen factories or return workers to work. Even to support demand when the virus passes they likely need to be more inventive -- combining rate cuts with targeted programs to cushion confidence and keep credit flowing. Another reason for that is most central banks are already short of ammunition after past rate reductions.With the Fed’s first move flopping  governments are under mounting pressure to do more. In the US  the House of Representatives passed a $7.8 billion emergency-spending bill to fund a response to the outbreak -- helping deliver a rebound in stocks lacking in the immediate aftermath of the Fed.“We’re only in the early innings of this crisis ” said former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Some economists argue that what’s happened is mostly a supply side shock  others have highlighted the wallop to demand as well  to the degree that the distinction matters. Supply shocks are inherently tougher for policy makers to address  because of the difficulty of quickly restoring the production  transport or communication networks or natural-resource inputs affected by the surprise hit. They most often involve fiscal authorities  who have up to now taken the back seat  leaving central bankers at the wheel. The US  Japan  Italy and South Korea are among those that have moved to assemble packages to address the virus  though in most cases they’re tied to the health-care industry and treatment and prevention specifically  not the broader economy. “Certainly  rate cuts will not help re-stock emptying grocery shelves ” said Seema Shah  chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “Monetary policy is hopeless when supply simply cannot feed demand ” she said. Targeted Approach On the demand side  where central bankers are the natural first-responders  the nature of the shock this time can make a broad-brush monetary response less effective. While lower borrowing costs can help give households greater spending power  that aid is limited if millions are shut up at home due to anti-virus measures -- or simply because of fears of catching the disease. That may help explain the People’s Bank of China’s preference to use targeted credit measures rather than large-scale interest-rate cuts since the virus erupted early this year. Among their steps  Chinese regulators have let banks run up larger totals of non-performing loans  and loosened guidelines for bond sales. The Fed too may need to get more expansive in its moves  Credit Suisse Group AG analysts argue. Zoltan Pozsar and James Sweeney said Tuesday that disruptions to the global supply chain could in turn cause payment failures  tightening financial conditions. “The supply chain is a payment chain in reverse ” the duo wrote. They urged “open-ended liquidity support through its balance sheet.” Last week saw the deepest slide in global equities since the credit crisis  a rapid turnaround from the record high of the MSCI All Country World Index just as recently as Feb. 12. It remains about 8% down on that peak after a 2.7% gain Wednesday  spurred by the US spending move along with relief among some investors that the moderate Democratic candidate for president  Joe Biden  did well in the Super Tuesday primaries. Still  the risk remains of further market disruptions. “While the Fed’s insurance cuts did serve its purpose into late 2019  the continued lowering of rates may have limited support for markets at present ” said Jingyi Pan  market strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. It all puts the onus on policy makers to contemplate greater inventiveness. Government spending may not be able to contain the virus spread  but it can help replace free-falling consumer demand. Chetan Ahya  chief economist at Morgan Stanley projects fiscal deficits for the four major advanced economies plus China to rise to at least 4.7% of gross domestic product this year  the most since 2011 and up from 4.1% last year. “COVID-19 is a particularly pernicious economic shock  as it is both a supply and demand-side shock ” said Mark Zandi  chief economist for Moody’s Analytic.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/coronavirus-global-economy-is-gripped-by-rare-twin-supply-demand-shock/story-T2Mg6MIp87zbSdJkrFiPwI.html
05/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,argentina;brazil;china;ecuador;india;saudi arabia,Coronavirus erases hopes for stronger growth in 2020  says IMF chief,The IMF is making available $50 billion in emergency funding to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic  she said after a call with the IMF’s steering committee.,The global spread of the novel coronavirus has crushed hopes for stronger growth this year and will hold 2020 global output gains to their slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday. The IMF now expects 2020 world growth to be below the 2.9% rate for 2019  and revised forecasts will be issued in the coming weeks  Georgieva told a news briefing. Trade wars pushed global growth last year to the lowest rate since a 0.7% contraction in 2009.  The changed forecast would represent a more than 0.4-percentage-point drop from the 3.3% growth the IMF had estimated for 2020 in January as US-China trade tensions eased. “Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year’s levels  but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict ” Georgieva said.   She declined to say whether the escalating health crisis could push the world into a recession. The IMF is making available $50 billion in emergency funding to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic  she said after a call with the IMF’s steering committee. About $10 billion of that can be accessed by the poorest countries at zero interest for up to 10 years  while many middle-income countries have access to a pool of about $40 billion at low interest for up to five years. Ecuador used the latter program in 2016 to get a $364 million loan after a devastating earthquake. But larger emerging-market countries such as Brazil  China  and India are ineligible for such assistance  as are countries where the IMF has declared debt to be unsustainable  including Argentina. Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass underscored the importance of coordinated action to limit the economic and human impact of the virus. The World Bank said on Tuesday it was providing $12 billion in immediate funds to help developing countries improve their health services  disease surveillance  access to medical supplies and working capital for businesses. DEEPER DECLINE Less than two weeks ago  the IMF told G20 finance leaders in Saudi Arabia that the virus could shave 0.1 percentage point off its January global growth forecast  a milder scenario based on expectations the coronavirus would be largely contained within China. That view changed over the past week as the virus spread rapidly outside China to more than 70 countries  Georgieva said. The shift has vastly increased uncertainty and caused demand worldwide to weaken  hitting trade and tourism hard and slashing demand for oil and other commodities as individuals and businesses take precautionary measures to avoid infection. In China  even as the spread of the virus has slowed  growth will be below the IMF’s most recent forecast for 5.6% in 2020  Georgieva said.  Still  the Fund was encouraged by the restart of some production in China  which is now at about 60% recovered and aiming to reach 90% in coming weeks  she said. She declined to discuss more specific scenarios on potential downgrades in growth estimates  saying: “What helps is concentrating on actions. Who cares if it will be 0.1 or 0.4 or 0.5? If we act  and focus on that  lives would be saved  suffering would be reduced and the economy would perk up faster.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-erases-hopes-for-stronger-growth-in-2020-says-imf-chief/story-h5yeHuwZaett3rpY8S90iO.html

At a press conference following a review meeting to fight the spread of coronavirus  Netanyahu said that several measures will be announced to prevent the spread of coronavirus but some simple measures like avoiding the normal handshake while greeting people may possibly be replaced with other forms of greetings like the Indian ‘Namaste’. He also demonstrated at the press conference as to how the Indians do ‘Namaste’ while greeting people. Netanyahu said that “we are in the middle of a global epidemic”  but Israel has done well as it was quick in taking action to prevent the spread of the virus in the country. “We have had to take rigorous steps to slow the spread of the disease in Israel  we have taken select isolation and flight policies and measures for flights ” he added. Israel has 15 confirmed cases of the deadly virus but no deaths  with some 7 000 others in home-quarantine. Health Minister Yaacov Litzman announced a ban on public gatherings of more than 5 000 people. “We will not hesitate to do things even if they are unpopular. I don’t want to call it an epidemic - but it’s not far from it ” he said. The Health Ministry has asked people to refrain from any unnecessary foreign trip.

Wednesday’s meeting was held against the backdrop of a spike in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 28  nearly half of them Italian tourists who contracted the infection from one man in their group. By the time doctors were able to confirm the infection  it transpires that the group had come in contact with over 200 Indians across six districts of Rajasthan where they had travelled. It was in this context that the PMO review decided to rapidly open proper testing  isolation and quarantine facilities in various parts of the country  down to the district level. An official statement issued later said these facilities would be rolled out in partnership with the state governments. The Bharatiya Janata Party has already cancelled Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in Hyderabad scheduled to be held on March 15. K Krishna Saagar Rao of the Telangana BJP said the rally had been deferred to a future date. The government  in an effort to ensure that any more people infected with the virus do not enter the country  has introduced screening of all travellers returning from abroad. Changes are also being made in the immigration form that requires travellers to declare the countries that they have visited in recent days and weeks. This would enable the government to isolate potential cases for a closer examination  depending on their travel history. “Two important changes since yesterday to further enhance our level of preparedness  namely the introduction of universal screening at all international airports and sea-ports through use of thermal imagery equipment as well as mandatory declaration forms of places visited by tourists and travellers returning from abroad  were noted by all concerned for operationalization ” the PMO statement said.

Containing the outbreak is not the work of doctors alone  they said  adding that the police and transport departments should be involved in containing the virus  which until Wednesday had killed more than 3000 and infected over 93000 globally  the vast majority in China. Planning is the keyword  said Du Bin  director Medical ICU at Beijing’s Peking Union Medical College hospital. “How many cases do you have? What is the plan to cope with the disease or the patients? The laboratory-confirmed cases as well as the close contacts; where to keep the close contacts and how to identify the probable (cases) or cases within the close contacts. I do believe it is a very tough job but it has to be done ” Du said. Du said this at an interaction – along with other three frontline doctors from Wuhan – with journalists in Beijing via a video link on Wednesday afternoon. “Not only done by the health care workers but… other departments of the government have to be involved (such) as the public security  the police I mean  such as the transportation department or other departments. They have to work together. And  I think that’s the only way to control the epidemic not only in China but also in other countries ” Du said. Qiao Jie  president of Peking University’s Third hospital  said both India and China were important countries in Asia and has similarities like population and traditional family-centric activities. She said it was important to train the healthcare workers to treat covid-19 cases  adding  for example  mild and severe cases need different training. It was critical for the medics to know how to put on and then take off protective clothing  she said “Prepare the room. Use high power exhaust fans in the ward  changing (the) airflow for the patient and medical staff ” Qiao said. Training the community population  she said. “Even wearing the mask  washing hands…can isolate the disease; all very important ” she said. By the end of January  China had taken unprecedented and aggressive measures including virtually locking down the province of Hubei with a 60 million population to contain the spread of the virus. Wuhan  for example  was locked down on January 23  and remains so. The restrictions continue with hundreds of millions across China facing some kind of restrictions on their movements.

04/03/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,japan;united states,Japan’s Takeda Pharma says it is developing coronavirus drug,Takeda Pharma’s research would require antibodies from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus infections or who have been vaccinated  once a vaccine has been developed.,Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. said on Wednesday it was developing a drug for high-risk patients infected with the new coronavirus  joining several other drugmakers seeking to develop a treatment for an illness that has killed over 3 000 people. The Japanese firm said it was working on a plasma-derived therapy which had previously been shown to be effective in treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. Its research would require antibodies from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus infections or who have been vaccinated  once a vaccine has been developed. “By transferring the antibodies to a new patient  it may help that person’s immune system respond to the infection and increase their chance of recovery ” Takeda  said in a statement. It is also studying whether its currently marketed or pipeline products might be effective treatments for infected patients  the company said  adding those efforts were at an early stage. Takeda joins other drugmakers working on developing drugs to treat the flu-like disease which has struck more than 90 000 people worldwide. U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc said last week it had started two late-stage studies to test its drug  remdesivir  in patients with severe and moderate cases of the illness. Pfizer Inc  said on Monday it had identified certain antiviral compounds it has in development that have the potential to inhibit coronaviruses and is engaging with a third party to screen the compounds. Takeda said it would share its plans with members of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday and was in talks with various health and regulatory agencies and healthcare partners in the United States  Asia and Europe to move forward its research into the drug. The announcement comes amid news the U.S. Congress could debate and pass as early as this week emergency funding  possibly in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion  to help battle the virus and aid businesses. Prior to Takeda’s announcement  shares in the company  Japan’s biggest pharmaceuticals firm by market value  closed down 0.95%.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-takeda-pharma-says-it-is-developing-coronavirus-drug/story-YJWlq9KmypWmKSU7luVbJK.html

The disease  which first emerged in China  is appearing in new countries almost every day  with Iran  Italy and South Korea facing growing caseloads. The death toll in Italy soared to 79 on Tuesday  with more than 2 500 people infected. A group of Italian tourists was placed in quarantine in India  with 17 testing positive for the virus. One bright spot has been China’s apparent progress in slowing the epidemic  with official figures on Wednesday showing new cases falling for a third straight day. More than 90 000 people have been infected and around 3 200 have died worldwide  with Iraq reporting its first death from the disease on Wednesday while dozens have died so far in neighbouring Iran. The death rate is around 3.4 percent  much higher than the seasonal flu at under one percent  according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The vast majority of cases and fatalities have been in China where tens of millions of people have been placed under quarantine  but infections are rising faster abroad now  prompting countries to discourage large gatherings and cancel a slew of events. The death toll in the United States climbed to nine  many linked to a nursing home near Seattle  while the overall number of infections shot past 100. The WHO voiced concern that masks  goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers were running out due to “rising demand  hoarding and misuse”. “We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting our health workers ” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva  noting prices of masks have surged sixfold and the cost of ventilators has tripled. Tedros said the WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries  but warned that “supplies are rapidly depleting”. Shortages of equipment in China caused thousands of medical workers to become infected with a dozen dying  prompting the country to step up supplies by repurposing production lines at diaper  coat and smartphone factories to make masks and hazmat suits. Panic buying  At least 500 people queued up outside a supermarket in Seoul to buy masks on Wednesday  with President Moon Jae-in apologising for shortages this week. South Korea makes 10 million masks a day and the government has ordered manufacturers to supply half their output to post offices  pharmacies  and a nationwide agricultural co-operative for sale at a fixed low price  with a five-per-person limit. The virus has infected more than 5 600 people and killed 32 in South Korea  with more new daily cases there now than in China. China reported 38 more deaths on Wednesday but only 119 new cases  its lowest number since January  with most infections in central Hubei province’s capital Wuhan  where the virus was first detected in December. There have now been 2 981 deaths in China and over 80 000 cases. Indonesian police seized 600 000 face masks from a Jakarta-area warehouse after the country’s first confirmed cases of coronavirus sparked panic buying and sent prices for prevention products skyrocketing. “Mask prices have skyrocketed everywhere and there are shortages  most likely because hoarders are trying to make money at the public’s expense ” Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told AFP. Russia issued a decree Wednesday banning the export of masks  respirators and hazmat suits to ensure access to the items for medics treating coronavirus patients and the public. In Italy  a top civil protection official told AFP the country  which does not make face masks  is getting 800 000 of them from South Africa but needs at least 10 million more. Italian hospitals had initial supplies but the rapid spread of the epidemic has put the health system under strain  said Civil Protection Department director Luigi D’Angelo. French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday his government would requisition all face mask stocks and production in the coming months in response to the outbreak  after 2 000 masks were stolen from a hospital. A Chinese industry ministry official said Wednesday companies are encouraged to export protective gear to meet foreign demand as production now exceeds daily needs in Hubei  the epicentre of the epidemic.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-mask-shortages-as-coronavirus-cases-rise-worldwide/story-8zuhjIQZHOzh0a1GPS3WKP.html

Local religious authorities for their part announced a ban on mass prayers  including on Fridays  until further notice. The outbreak has fuelled public panic among Iraqis who say the war-ravaged country’s healthcare system cannot handle the epidemic.

The WHO chief observed  “as we get more data  we are understanding this virus  and the disease it causes  more and more.” He added  “this virus is not SARS  it’s not MERS  and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics. Both COVID-19 and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way  via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. However  there are some important differences between COVID-19 and influenza. Some countries are looking for cases of COVID-19 using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases.” According to evidence collected from China  which WHO observed  1 per cent of the reported COVID-19 cases do not display symptoms  and the majority of such cases tend to develop symptoms within two days. A total of 90 893 cases of COVID-19 infections and 3110 deaths have been reported globally. As per data released by the WHO  China reported 129 cases over the past 24 hours  which is the lowest number of cases since January 20. Outside China  1848 cases were reported from 48 countries  of which  80 percent of cases are from just three countries -  the Republic of Korea  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Italy. Meanwhile  12 new countries have reported their first cases  and there are now 21 countries with one case reported from each country. At least 122 countries have not reported any cases.  “There are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics to cure the disease. It can be contained - which is why we must do everything we can to contain it. That’s why WHO recommends a comprehensive approach ” said Ghebreyesus.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-slower-than-flu-but-more-dangerous-who/story-OQcL9riSkzYr4wmdMu84JI.html

The government has stepped up screening efforts to curb its spread.,Fourteen of the 24 Italian nationals taken to the quarantine facility of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in Chhawla near Delhi  have tested positive for coronavirus  officials familiar with the matter said. An Indian is also among those who has tested positive  the officials further said. The 24 (21 Italian nationals and three Indians) tourists were in the same group as the Italian national who had tested positive of the virus earlier  the officials further said. The three Indians in the group are the guide  bus driver and helper of the tourists. The Italian tourist was the sixth confirmed case of coronavirus in India. The 69-year-old Italian’s wife also tested positive for the virus on Tuesday but her samples are being sent to Pune for another test. The couple has been kept in isolation at the Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital. As concerns over the spread of the virus mounted  Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an extensive review on the preparedness on Tuesday. He urged the people not to panic and instead take basic protective measures. A man from Mayur Vihar in Delhi  who had travelled to Italy recently  had tested positive on Monday. He was shifted to a quarantine ward at Safdarjung Hospital on Sunday night.

He cited experts’ advice against mass gatherings to contain the spread of disease.  Holi  the festival of colours  will be celebrated across the country next week.  “Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence  this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme ” the PM tweeted. Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence  this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme. The highly contagious Sars-CoV-2 virus  which causes Covid-19  is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets from  and from close contact with  infected persons. With a long incubation period of 14 days and a high ability to survive in the environment  the virus is far more dangerous than flu viruses such as H1N1  which survive on surfaces for two to eight hours. Infected people spread the disease even when they themselves don’t have symptoms (fever  cough  breathing difficulties)  or have a very mild form of the disease  or develop symptoms late in disease progression.  India has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the disease after two new novel coronavirus cases  one each in Delhi and Hyderabad  were confirmed. Public awareness  active surveillance for early detection and isolation of cases  rapid identification and daily monitoring of close contacts  and clinical care have helped India isolate and cure three imported cases of Covid-19 in students in Kerala.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-not-to-participate-in-any-holi-milan-events-amid-coronavirus-scare-cites-experts-opinion-on-mass-gatherings/story-sJm9hYGKtKmHFDkqI1RIZL.html
04/03/2020,coronavirus;technology;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,Coronavirus: China’s schools  forced online by virus  run into censors,It was the first day of an unusual semester. Across China  schools are shut indefinitely in a bid to contain a new virus that has killed some 3 000 people.,Less than 30 minutes into a lecture on bioinformatics  Chu Xinjian’s class was abruptly cut short. It was the first day of an unusual semester. Across China  schools are shut indefinitely in a bid to contain a new virus that has killed some 3 000 people. Chu’s class was one of tens of thousands of courses  from grade school to university  that have been forced online. Chu’s professor was painstakingly sending voice recordings to the class group chat when  without warning  the system disbanded the group for violating China’s Internet regulations — a pervasive  almost mundane part of life under Communist Party rule. The students were puzzled. Was it because of something about the subject matter? Bioinformatics is the science of collecting and analyzing complex biological data. “I’m not sure exactly what phrases triggered it ” said Chu  who recounted the incident. “I guess we touched on some sensitive topic.” Major social media platforms including Facebook  YouTube and Twitter are blocked in China  while homegrown ones such as Weibo and WeChat are heavily monitored and scrubbed for offensive content by the state Cyberspace Administration and police. Now  the sudden arrival of public education onto platforms that are generally the domain of celebrity livestreamers has thrown the controls into stark relief. Classrooms are confronting the ubiquity and often arbitrary nature of the ruling Communist Party’s online censorship. Biology courses have been blocked for “pornographic content.” History and politics classes are among the most vulnerable; subjects such as the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward are regularly censored in classes and online discussions. Daily life in the world’s most populous nation has undergone a radical transformation in the past six weeks. Once-bustling streets are empty  fast-food restaurants offer only takeout service and group activities have been replaced with remote everything — remote work  remote fitness class  remote schooling. “Classes have stopped but learning will not ” the Education Ministry said in a February notice. It has established 24 000 free online courses on 22 web platforms  covering both undergraduate and vocational disciplines. Yet many lesson plans have been stymied by the country’s strict online regulators. Louis Wang  a middle school history teacher in northeast China  said his workload has ballooned because of an arduous approval process for online classes. While teachers have some leeway to facilitate spontaneous discussion in a classroom setting  online classes can be recorded  with the potential for clips to be taken out of context and circulated online. “Every word that is spoken in a video recording must be pre-approved ” Wang said. For him  that means writing word-for-word his entire lecture — about 5 000 Chinese characters — for review by school administrators. Even seemingly non-controversial statements can run afoul of the censors. Wang said one of his colleagues  a politics teacher  was trying to upload a document for his students with “socialism with Chinese characteristics” in its title. The phrase was championed by former leader Deng Xiaoping and is still frequently used by the government today. For reasons unexplained  the cloud platform blocked the document. It could be uploaded only after the overtly political phrase was removed. Teachers are using workarounds to skirt a variety of digital obstacles. On the messaging app WeChat  documents can be rejected for transmission to a group chat if a file fails a “safety inspection.” The same documents  however  can often be shared in direct messages  so some teachers have resorted to sending files to parents and students one-by-one. “Teachers having their online classes blocked  that’s funny  because it’s too absurd ” Wang Yuechi  a well-known Chinese comedian wrote on his verified account on Weibo  an app similar to Twitter. “This is not normal — it’s because there’s no freedom of speech ” he wrote. “Just like how it’s not normal that this post will also be deleted. I hope everyone can be aware of this. The absence of freedom of speech will impact our education  our lives. This has already happened. It’s not so funny now  is it?” As Wang predicted  his post can no longer be viewed on Weibo. Not every online class mishap involves censorship. Sometimes technical difficulties are the culprit. Cheng Yufan  a university student in the southern province of Jiangsu  inadvertently became the host of a lecture on the first day of online classes last month. When class was set to start  her philosophy professor was nowhere to be found  Cheng said. The professor was logged onto a different platform; meanwhile  the other one had designated Cheng as group administrator. Their professor fared no better on the second platform. Internet connection issues resulted in Cheng and her classmates tuning into two hours of silence. Afterwards  the unwitting professor wrote in their class group chat  “See you next time!”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/corona-virus-china-s-schools-forced-online-by-virus-run-into-censors/story-RfrHLEfilu4qYu70E8a89N.html

04/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;indonesia;india;italy;singapore,Two suspected of coronavirus at Chandigarh PGI  31 home quarantined in city,Blood samples of the two sent to AIIMS Delhi  report by Wednesday,Two suspected cases of Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) have been reported at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on Tuesday. “Two men  both aged 29 years have been quarantined in the isolation ward of the institute ” said PGIMER spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar .  Doctors at the institute said that a Sector-50 resident  with a history of travel to Indonesia and Singapore last week with his family  had reported sick at the institute with initial symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly  the second person  a Sector-29 resident  has a travel history to Bali. Doctors said that in both suspected cases  the patients are stable and under constant monitoring. Since Coronavirus was first identified in December last year  in the Chinese city of Wuhan  it has spread across 73 countries and territories  with more than 90 000 cases reported worldwide as of Monday evening. Even as medical workers are furiously battling the disease  172 deaths have been reported outside mainland China  raising the global death toll to 3 115. Excluding mainland China  the most severe outbreaks are in South Korea (5 186 cases  29 deaths)  Iran (1 501 cases  66 deaths) and Italy (2 036 cases  52 deaths). The WHO has warned that in the near future it could classify the incident as a global pandemic.  In India  a total of six confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been reported till now. Three residents of Kerala  all of whom had returned from Wuhan  had tested positive and were put under isolation. They were treated in Kerala hospitals and by February 20  all of them were discharged. On Monday  two fresh cases were reported  with the first being a 45-year old Delhi man who returned from Europe  and the second  a 26-year-old software engineer from Hyderabad who had returned from Dubai. On Tuesday  a 69-year-old Italian tourist admitted to a hospital in Jaipur tested positive for COVID 19. For the two suspected cases in Chandigarh  hospital sources said their blood samples have sent to Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences for tests and reports are expected in the next 24 hours. The line of treatment will depend on the reports. Meanwhile  in an advisory  the PGIMER has said that in view of the increased number of suspected and confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the country  it is advised that such patients should be managed in a local health care facility designated in their respective state for containment and standard treatment by following isolation precautions for aerosol diseases.  “The samples for testing may be sent to designated labs in AIIMS  New Delhi. It has further been advised that people should not panic and simple washing of hands with soap and water can curtail the spread of the virus. There is no recommendation for the general public to use a mask. Non-essential travel to countries reporting active cases of COVID 19 should be avoided ” reads the advisory.  The director health and family welfare  Dr GS Dewan has written to senior superintendent of police(SSP) asking the police department to cooperate and make audio announcements regarding Corona virus at traffic points in Chandigarh  through the public address system. The audio announcements are to be made from March 4 till March 31. The police top brass has given directions to all station house officers (SHO) to ensure public announcements are made at every point regularly starting from tomorrow.  Meanwhile  Chandigarh’s health administration has said that as many as 31 citizens from the city who have a travel history to affected nations have been quarantined at home. Chandigarh’s state surveillance officer   Dr Upendrajeet Singh Gill  said that 31 persons have been home quarantined for 28 days and 5 people will have even completed the period on Wednesday. “Among foreign nationals  three have been quarantined in hotels here. A total of 17 foreign nationals were in the city and 14 have left in the last one month ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-suspected-of-coronavirus-at-chandigarh-pgi-31-home-quarantined-in-city/story-K2KwVlWy2GwSNTnhThKgIL.html
03/03/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,singapore;china;india;italy;japan,Sharing coronavirus patient info helped Singapore contain infection,All information on coronavirus cases is shared on a live dashboard  which includes the number of confirmed cases  infection growth rate  ICU admissions  and discharged patients.,Information about the two confirmed novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases that surfaced in Delhi and Hyderabad came in bits and pieces from people with knowledge of the cases because the health ministry refused to share details pleading patient confidentiality. No one wanted the patients’ names or addresses  but the government even refused to officially share the age  gender  or the extent and nature of the movement of the two persons after their arrival in India. That is unfortunate because this crucial data may have prompted people who risked catching the infection from the two persons to notify the health department and stay quarantined at home to stop the spread of the infection. One person was a Delhi resident who recently travelled to Italy and the other was a software engineer from Hyderabad who has a travel history from Dubai. In sharp contrast  Singapore has used transparent data sharing and stringent contact tracing as tools to contain confirmed cases to 108 despite the first four Covid-19 cases being reported early on in the epidemic that has its epicentre in China’s Wuhan. Unlike in South Korea and Japan  there have been no virus-related deaths and 78 people have recovered in the city-state. All information on Covid-19 cases is shared on a live dashboard  which includes the number of confirmed cases  infection growth rate  ICU admissions  and discharged patients. Along with this  the age and gender distribution  areas of cluster outbreaks  date of diagnosis among others  is also shared with the public for realtime tracking of virus behaviour and the infection pattern. Singapore reported its first Covid-19 case on January 29  and “limited local transmission” began by February 4  when four women who had not travelled to China tested positive. This was followed by half-a-dozen clusters of infections.  As soon as “limited local transmission” was confirmed  Singapore’s ministry of health swung into action and asked the public to prepare for wider transmission. “There is no evidence of widespread community transmission  but despite our best efforts  Singapore could still see extensive community spread ” health minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press conference on February 4. Singapore was among the first countries to impose travel restrictions on people who had recently been to China and other affected countries. A Chinese couple who lied about their travel history were fined under the Infectious Diseases Act  and people who lied about breached quarantine have had their residency status and work passes revoked. “Singapore has been extremely proactive in screening and containment.  There are thermal scanners at very entry and exit gate at Changi airport that offers comprehensive scanning without people having to stop or queue up  like it’s done in India. Every business office and many large condominiums have thermal scanners  and the government sends masks to RWAs {residents welfare association}. There is concern but no panic... ” said Suman Bose  founder of GoFar  a Singapore-based advisory and investment firm. The ministry of health has also activated Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) for patients with respiratory symptoms. “People with fever and respiratory symptoms can go to the nearest clinic for subsidised treatment and medicines for as little as Singapore $10 without having to go to a hospital ” said Bose  who travelled to India on February 14 and had to queue up for close to an hour to go through the thermal scanner. In case of escalation  the ministry of health has also asked people to be prepared for measures to reduce human interaction  such as cancelling of large events and mass gatherings  suspension of schools  avoidance of non-essential travel and services to stop the virus from spreading from local clusters to the community,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharing-patient-info-helped-singapore-contain-infection/story-xbbKSexZBdFYkIptKZBMTO.html

03/03/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,singapore;india,In Rahul Gandhi’s jibe at Modi  Singapore PM’s video on coronavirus is ammo,In two tweets separated by an hour  Gandhi accused the prime minister of not taking the threat posed by coronavirus seriously and asked him to stop wasting the country’s time “playing the clown” with his social media accounts.,Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday tweeted Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s video address to his country on dealing with coronavirus outbreak with a sharp attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In two tweets separated by an hour  Gandhi accused the prime minister of not taking the threat posed by coronavirus seriously and asked him to stop wasting the country’s time “playing the clown” with his social media accounts. Gandhi’s swipe is seen as a reference to PM Modi generating quite some buzz on social media last evening when he declared that he was thinking of “giving up” his social media accounts on Facebook  Twitter  YouTube and Instagram on Sunday. That tweet was interpreted to imply that he would exit social media. WATCH | PM Modi ends suspense on quitting social media  reveals special plan The prime minister ended the suspense this morning when he tweeted again with a campaign to let women “whose life and work inspire us” take over his social media handles on Sunday to commemorate International Women’s Day. Gandhi had tweeted soon after  prodding the prime minister to focus on averting “the massive crisis about to be unleashed by the virus on India and its economy”. In a second tweet  he rubbed it in. “Quit wasting India’s time playing the clown with your social media accounts  when India is facing an emergency. Focus the attention of every Indian on taking on the Corona virus challenge ” Gandhi tweeted to PM Modi. He also uploaded a video of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong where the chief executive of the city-state had spoken at length on the challenge  how the government was facing the challenge and how citizens could contribute. Gandhi’s tweet came around the same time that the prime minister was holding a review meeting to assess the state of preparedness. PM Modi tweeted soon after that different ministries and states were working together in this regard. “There is no need to panic. We need to work together  take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection ” he said  putting out a Twitter card - Basic protective measures for all - that listed six precautions that people should take.

Besides the Indians  the US-made IAF relief aircraft also evacuated more than dozen nationals from four countries - Bangladesh  South Africa  Madagascar and Maldives. The majority among the foreigners were Bangladeshi students. A group of OCI card-holding Chinese citizens were also on the flight. However  around 25-30 Indians remain in Hubei and Wuhan of their own volition. “76 Indian nationals are returning home on this flight  which also has on board 23 nationals from Bangladesh  6 from China  2 each from Myanmar and Maldives and one each from South Africa  USA and Madagascar  ” Indian ambassador to China Vikram Misri said. The flight was delayed on Wednesday night after a group of passengers had to be repeatedly tested after they exhibited fever syndromes  following which all registered passengers were finally allowed to board the flight. All the evacuees are likely to go through mandatory 14-day quarantine at facilities set up in New Delhi. India has already evacuated 647 nationals and seven Maldivians in two Air India flights in the first week of February. Earlier in the day  the Indian flight came in with 15 tonnes of medical supplies to aid China in its fight against covid-19 outbreak  which has so far killed 2718 people and infected 78196 more in mainland China. The relief flight was expected a week ago but had to be postponed because India received the clearance for the aircraft to land in Wuhan today only on Monday. An Indian government statement said the medical assistance comprised “…masks  gloves and other emergency medical equipment”. “This assistance has been provided in the wake the Corona virus (Covid 19) outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment ” it added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping on February 8  2020 expressing India’s solidarity “…with the people and Government of China and also offered assistance to China in this hour of need as a gift. The medical supplies will help augment the China’s efforts to control the outbreak of this infection which has been declared as a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organisation ” the statement added. It was also a “mark of friendship and solidarity from the people of India towards the people of China as the two countries also celebrate 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations this year ” the statement said.

26/02/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;italy;jordan,Indian boxing team in Italy wary of virus threat,India’s high performance director Santiago Nieva said the national team plans to stay for one more day before taking a final call to leave Italy’s Olympic training centre in Assisi  which is a two-hour drive from Rome’s International airport.,The Indian boxing squad  based out of Italy and preparing for the Olympic qualifiers  are putting in place an emergency plan to leave their training base after the country reported the biggest surge in novel coronavirus cases outside of Asia. India’s high performance director Santiago Nieva said the national team plans to stay for one more day before taking a final call to leave Italy’s Olympic training centre in Assisi  which is a two-hour drive from Rome’s International airport. The 13-member group  including the women’s squad  has been camping in Assisi for the last two weeks to prepare for next month’s Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifying tournament in Amman  Jordan from March 3. At least six people have died and more than 200 are affected by the virus outbreak in Italy  with the bulk of the cases reported from the northern region of Lombardy  whose capital is the city of Milan. “It is a sort of emergency for us too ” Nieva said over the phone. Milan is close to 500km from Assisi. “It was alarming. I had to send a SOS signal to the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) fearing if things get worse  we could possibly miss the important tournament in Jordan. Therefore should leave as early as possible ” Nieva said. Milan has already put emergency measures in place  with all schools and offices closed and major screening efforts in place at airports. On Tuesday  after an assurance from the Italian Boxing Federation president Vittorio Lai that the situation is being monitored  the Indian team decided to wait and see how the situation develops. “There are good sparring partners as more than 10 countries are camping here to prepare for the Olympic qualifiers ” Nieva said. “We had good training on Monday and have another important training session on Wednesday. After that we will decide whether to leave or stay till the weekend ” Nieva added. According to the original schedule  the Indian team is supposed to leave on Friday or Saturday for Jordan. BFI secretary general Jay Kowli said precautionary measures are being taken by the team. “The Italian boxing federation is supporting all the teams ” he said. Six-time world champion Mary Kom (51kg) is one of the key members of the Indian team training in Assisi.

26/02/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;japan,IOC senior member: 3 months to decide fate of Tokyo Olympics,Pound  in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press  did not sound alarmist. But he did speak frankly about the risks facing the Olympics  which open July 24.,Dick Pound  the longest-serving member of the IOC  estimates there’s a three-month window to decide the fate of the Tokyo Olympics  which are being threatened by the fast-spreading virus from China. Pound  in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press  did not sound alarmist. But he did speak frankly about the risks facing the Olympics  which open July 24. Pound has been an International Olympic Committee member since 1978  13 years longer than current President Thomas Bach. “You could certainly go to two months out if you had to ” Pound said  which would mean putting off a decision until late May and hoping the virus is under control. “A lot of things have to start happening. You’ve got to start ramping up your security  your food  the Olympic Village  the hotels  The media folks will be in there building their studios.” And if it got to the point of not going ahead  Pound speculated “you’re probably looking at a cancellation.” “This is the new war and you have to face it. In and around that time  I’d say folks are going to have to ask: ‘Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo  or not?’”  China on Tuesday reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths  68 of them in the central city of Wuhan  where the epidemic was first detected in December. The updates bring mainland China’s totals to 77 658 cases and 2 663 deaths. South Korea now has the second-most cases in the world with 977  including 10 deaths. Clusters of the illness are now appearing in the Middle East and Europe. This could signal a new stage in the spread of the virus with four deaths reported in Japan. Pound encouraged athletes to keep training. About 11 000 are expected for the Olympics  and another 4 400 for the Paralympics  which open on Aug. 25. “As far as we all know you’re going to be in Tokyo ” Pound said. “All indications are at this stage that it will be business as usual. So keep focused on your sport and be sure that the IOC is not going to send you into a pandemic situation.” The modern Olympics dating from 1896 have only been cancelled during wartime  and faced boycotts in 1976 in Montreal  in 1980 in Moscow and 1984 in Los Angeles — all in Pound’s memory. The Olympics in 1940 were to be in Tokyo  but were called off because of Japan’s war with China and World War II. Pound called uncertainty a major problem and repeated the IOC’s stance — that it’s depending on consultations with the World Health Organization  a United Nations body  to make any move. So far  the games are on. “It’s a big  big  big decision and you just can’t take it until you have reliable facts on which to base it ” Pound said. He said whatever advice the IOC is now getting  “it doesn’t call for cancellation or postponement of the Olympics. You just don’t postpone something on the size and scale of the Olympics. There’s so many moving parts  so many countries and different seasons  and competitive seasons  and television seasons. You can’t just say  we’ll do it in October.” If changes have to be made  Pound said every option faced obstacles. Pound said moving to another city seemed unlikely. “To move the place is difficult because there are few places in the world that could think of gearing up facilities in that short time to put something on ” Pound said. London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has suggested the British capital as an alternative. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike suggested that was an inappropriate offer  using the virus as political campaign fodder. Pound said he would not favor a dispersal of events over various venues because that wouldn’t “constitute an Olympic Games. You’d end up with a series of world championships.” He said it would be very difficult to spread around all these sports in a 17-day period with only a few month’s notice. Staying in Tokyo but moving it back a few months would be unlikely to satisfy North American broadcasters  whose schedules are full in the fall with American football  college football  European soccer  basketball  baseball  and ice hockey. Of course  other world broadcasters also have jammed schedules. “It would be tough to get the kind of blanket coverage that people expect around the Olympic Games ” Pound said. “It’s certainly tougher than it would have been in 1964 in Tokyo when you didn’t have the saturation sports schedule on television.” How about delaying for a year  but staying in Tokyo? Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics  although a national audit board says the country is spending twice that much. “Then you have to ask if you can hold the bubble together for an extra year ” Pound said. “Then of course you have to fit all of this into the entire international sports schedule.” Pound said the IOC has been building up an “emergency fund” for such circumstances  reported to be about $1 billion. That could fund international sports federations who depend on income from the IOC to operate — and the IOC itself. “This would be what you normally call a force majeure ” said Pound  a Canadian lawyer by training  using the legal phrase for “unforeseeable circumstances.” “It’s not an insurable risk and it’s not one that can be attributed to one or the other of the parties. So everybody takes their lumps. There would be a lack of revenue on the Olympic Movement side.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/ioc-senior-member-3-months-to-decide-fate-of-tokyo-olympics/story-xtllBzN7PpTt6cQdLTRIKO.html
14/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,australia;bangladesh;china;hong kong;india;japan;nepal;pakistan;singapore;thailand;united states,What makes Covid-19 a global public health enemy?,Covid-19 has caused 1 380 deaths  has infected 63 851 people and spread across 28 countries. In the middle of rumors and reports  here is what you need to know about the virus.,Coronavirus  which emerged from Wuhan city in China’s Hubei province in December last year  quickly spread across the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) took time to declare it a health emergency (it did so weeks later)  and later named it Covid-19. The virus has caused 1 380 deaths  has infected 63 851 people and spread across 28 countries. In the middle of rumors and reports  here is all you need to know about the virus.  What is Covid-19?  It is a new strain from the coronavirus family (hence the initial name novel coronavirus or n-CoV) which affects the respiratory system in humans. Other examples of the virus are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. It has only recently been renamed Covid-19  inspired from words “corona”  “virus”  and “disease”  with 2019 representing the year that it emerged.  This virus that causes flu-like symptoms   such as dry-cough  fever  and breathing problems. It probably seems mild in some cases  like that of an Australian student who contracted the virus on Diamond Princess  the ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. Such cases may have a fairly quick recovery rate like one patient  out of the three who were initially tested positive for Covid-19  in Kerala  whose diagnosis later turned negative. In more severe cases  patients may have underlying health conditions and then go on to develop viral-phenomena.  This strand of coronavirus  much like others  came from animals. Illegal trading of pangolin is suspected to be the cause for the entrance of Covid-19 into human species.  How did Covid-19 spread? The virus was first identified in China  at Wuhan on December 31st. Covid-19 is airborne and transmitted by people sneezing or coughing. Someone can either swallow the virus or touch a surface where the virus is with their hands  and then touch their mouth & nose with the same.  The advancements in international transportation systems and excessive globalization have made it easy for Covid-19  to hop into a host’s body to travel far and beyond. Evidence of this phenomenon is the Diamond Princess  a cruise ship initially carrying 3 711 passengers  now has about 174 identified cases of the disease. Outside Mainland China  the ship is the largest cluster of Covid-19. There are two Indian citizens among those tested positive on the ship quarantined at a dock in Yokohama  Tokyo since February 3rd. The ship is said to be under Japanese jurisdiction until February 19th  2020 and it is unclear if and what Indian authorities are going to do after that.  What is the economic threat?  Global pandemics are very costly for human society and have only gotten pricier with the increasing interconnectedness of the international economy. For example  SARS caused losses in productivity estimated over $40 billion.  Though  right now  there are no estimates about how much Covid-19  is going to cost the global economy in total  businesses  big and small  are suffering its effects. Handset manufacturer Vivo and chipset maker Intel  along with some other prominent brands  have pulled out of the Mobile World Congress 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. This is an important event that creates over 14 000 part-time jobs in Barcelona. Giants like Airbnb and Apple have also been impacted. Airbnb has suspended check-ins to all Beijing listings until March and Apple’s prime manufacturer Foxconn is producing under 50% until the end of February. Lack of tourism and fall in demand of general commodities because of quarantine efforts has also adversely affected small business in China. There have been mounting concerns about the impact that continuing spread of the disease would have on China’s economy. One reason why  President Xi was reported to have cautioned officials to not go overboard with imposing restrictions. President Xi  according to a Reuters report  felt they had already gone too far. Any impact of the virus on the Chinese economy would have a ripple effect that would be felt far away including on  oil prices  as China is the world’s largest importer.  The politics around Covid-19 Given the virus’s ‘global’ footprint  it may be impossible to contain it without support from different international parties. The World Health Organization has been heavily involved with the Chinese government to prevent further spread of the disease and to hunt for a potential cure.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conveyed solidarity with the Chinese President Xi in the form of a letter. In the same  he expressed appreciation for the measures taken by the Chinese government to restrict the spread of the virus. United States President Donald Trump has also congratulated President Xi on his efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trump claimed “...(that) during the month of April  the heat  generally speaking  kills this type of virus.” This remark has been condemned by Anthony Fauci  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The US State Department moved out almost 300 U.S. citizens  from Wuhan  on February 6st. However  Tedros Adhanom  head of WHO  has advised against the evacuation of foreigners.  Response by India and its neighbours  600 Indians were flown back to the country from Wuhan by the government on January 31th and February 1st. They were housed in two quarantine centres  one in Delhi and one in Manesar. According to Vikram Misri  Indian Ambassador to China  the whole evacuation process was a ‘strategic nightmare’. Passengers coming from China  Hong Kong  Singapore  Thailand  and Nepal into India are being screened at all major sea and land ports. There are now two positive novel coronavirus cases in India in the state of Kerala currently undergoing treatment. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticized the Centre for not giving the Covid-19 outbreak graver attention.  Bangladesh has decided not to fly back its 171 citizens due to internal issues.  Pakistan  a country that’d initially decided not to evacuate the 800 Pakistani students living in Wuhan  is now reconsidering its course of action after coming under pressure by quarantined students on social media. “The matter is being considered at the high level and best possible decision would be taken after considering all possible aspects.

14/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;australia;japan,IOC face ‘big communications job’ as virus jitters hit Tokyo Olympics,The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) coordination commission insisted there was no danger of Tokyo 2020 being cancelled or moved  despite fears over the fast-spreading virus which has killed nearly 1 400 and infected around 64 000 -- most of them in China.,Olympic chiefs admitted Friday they face a “very big communications job” to soothe concerns over the coronavirus epidemic in the run-up to this summer’s Tokyo Games. The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) coordination commission insisted there was no danger of Tokyo 2020 being cancelled or moved  despite fears over the fast-spreading virus which has killed nearly 1 400 and infected around 64 000 -- most of them in China. But he said the IOC will send out information packs to reassure athletes that it’s safe to come into contact with competitors from China. “The advice we have received from the World Health Organization (WHO) is that there is no case for a contingency plan to cancel or move the Games ” John Coates told reporters after a project review meeting. “Certainly it’s a very big communications job that needs to be undertaken ” he added  noting that China is set to send more than 600 athletes to Tokyo. “But we hear that most of the Chinese athletes are now out of China. I don’t know how many were to be involved in test events here  but I don’t see a problem if they’re coming from another country.” Coates promised lessons would be learned from Rio four years ago  when concerns over the mosquito-born Zika virus led to several top athletes pulling out of the Olympics  including golfers Jason Day and Rory McIlroy. “The WHO pointed out the likelihood of Zika being a problem at the time of the Games was very low ” he said. “But we did lose some athletes -- Jason Day’s wife was pregnant. We didn’t communicate the information well enough.” Tokyo organisers have slammed “fake news” and scare-mongering over the coronavirus outbreak for causing panic ahead of the Games  which open on July 24. More than 25 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like disease  which the WHO has declared a global health emergency. - ‘Tokyo 2020 on track’ -  Japan  which registered its first fatality on Thursday of someone who had tested positive for the virus  is one of the worst-hit countries outside of mainland China. There have been 33 cases on land and more than 200 positive tests of people quarantined on a cruise ship floating off Yokohama since last week. Coates conceded that there could be fear among athletes about facing competitors from China. “We did talk about that ” said the Australian. “The IOC is going to ensure (information) kits are sent to all national committees to explain what’s happening around the world where Chinese athletes are competing ” he added. “But I can confirm Tokyo 2020 remains on track ” insisted Coates  who revealed IOC president Thomas Bach will lay a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on the sidelines of the May 19-20 executive project review. The virus has already impacted sporting events in Asia  including Olympic qualifiers for boxing and basketball -- both in China. Formula One’s Shanghai Grand Prix  scheduled to take place in April  has been postponed with the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix also under threat. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has come under fire for its handling of the infection  especially quarantine measures seen as too lax in the early stages of the epidemic. “We don’t yet know who will be competing at test events so we can’t say anything for sure ” said Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto  when pressed to specify measures being taken to tackle the epidemic. “But we will have information from the qualifiers that are under way and take the necessary steps.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/ioc-face-big-communications-job-as-virus-jitters-hit-tokyo-olympics/story-3uxF3vbkbhkCvUFSTCG8YI.html

12/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,China’s F1 grand prix hangs in balance over virus fears,Formula One’s managing director Ross Brawn said last week that they will look to reschedule the Shanghai race if it does not go ahead in April.,The fate of the Chinese Grand Prix is expected to be announced on Thursday as reports said it will not take place as planned on April 19 because of the new coronavirus. Several British media outlets ran unsourced reports on Wednesday saying the Shanghai race  the fourth of the new season  will be either postponed or cancelled. It would be the latest -- but easily most high-profile -- sports event to fall victim to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1 100 people in China  where it emerged at the end of last year. AFP understands that an announcement about the race will be made on Thursday  but according to the BBC  it is “expected to be postponed”. It also throws into doubt the inaugural race in Vietnam  which takes place two weeks before Shanghai but where there have also been cases of the virus  officially named COVID-19. Formula One’s managing director Ross Brawn said last week that they will look to reschedule the Shanghai race if it does not go ahead in April. “We will leave open the opportunity to see if the race can run later in the year ” he said  according to the BBC. “China is an enthusiastic  growing market so we’d like to have a race in China.” China has been forced to cancel or put off a host of sporting events due to the coronavirus epidemic  from suspending all football in the country to postponing the first badminton tournament of the 2020 world tour season. The world’s most populous country has increasingly become a powerhouse in hosting international sport in recent years  but has had its sporting calendar thrown into chaos. Athletics’ World Indoor Championships  scheduled for Nanjing in March 13-15  have been postponed for a year. The Chinese Formula E Grand Prix  due to take place in Sanya on the southern island of Hainan on March 21  was called off “after close consultation” with government authorities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/china-s-f1-grand-prix-hangs-in-balance-over-virus-fears/story-muu9fT4gQpST7GlH6RscgP.html
12/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china,Coronavirus death toll climbs to 1 114 in China as WHO names it Covid-19,Wuhan city  and much of Hubei province  has been under an unprecedented lockdown January 23 onwards to contain the outbreak.,More than 90 people died from the coronavirus outbreak in China on Tuesday  pushing the death toll to 1 114 until midnight  Chinese health officials said on Wednesday. The total number of infections has risen to 44 742 with more than 33 300 cases reported from the worst-hit central Chinese province of Hubei  the officials added. The Geneva-based WHO has given a new name to the disease  Covid-19  which was announced late on Tuesday. The soaring numbers come in the backdrop of authorities ordering the sealing of residential buildings in Wuhan  the epicentre of the outbreak  from Tuesday to prevent human-to-human transmission. “All residential communities will be sealed off from Tuesday  in a bid to further strengthen the control of the epidemic and minimise the flow of personnel ” a government notice said adding that “…all building units with confirmed patients or suspected cases should be strictly closed and managed.” “Suspected cases with mild symptoms including patients who have a fever should be quarantined and treated at nearby designated medical institutions. They shall not seek medical treatment in other districts to curb the spread of the virus ” another notice  quoted by Chinese state media  said. The city  and much of Hubei province  has been under an unprecedented lockdown January 23 onwards to contain the outbreak. The Hubei housing authority has announced that all the residential areas in the province would restrict people from going in and out amid coronavirus outbreak  all people would have body temperature checked before entry  provincial media reported. “Wuhan  epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak  is still at very difficult moment  although 2019 n-CoV has lower death rate compared to SARS and MERS  the city has not completely solved the problem of people-to-people transmission ” Zhong Nanshan  the Chinese government top medical advisor on the epidemic said on Tuesday. The province reported 1 638 new cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia on February 11  with 94 new deaths and 417 cases of recovery. The total number of infections in the province climbed to 33 366  with 1 068 deaths and 2 639 cases of recovery. Hours earlier  the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had given a new name to the illness that has triggered an international public health emergency  infecting nearly 400 more people in 24 countries. The name “COVID-19” does not make any reference to a place or animal to avoid stigmatisation. “We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location  an animal  an individual or group of people  and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease ” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said while announcing it. “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks ” he added. The new name is taken from the words “corona”  “virus” and “disease”  with 2019 representing the year that it emerged. The outbreak emerged in Hubei’s capital city  Wuhan  in December and was reported to the WHO December 31. “COVID-19 (or Covid-19) stands for coronavirus disease in 2019 ” Soumya Swaminathan  WHO’s chief scientist said in Geneva at a press briefing. “The virus itself is named by international group of virologists who will look into the taxonomy ” she said  adding: “But it is important to have a name for this disease that everybody uses.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-climbs-to-1-114-in-china-as-who-names-it-covid-19/story-nWJtv1xdjXX4hmAUZ9doGP.html

An associate professor at the Wuhan Textile University  Ashish Kumar Yadav  35  stated that his wife Neha was advised rest after a minor surgery and thus they missed the earlier evacuation process. Neha Yadav is pursuing a PhD in computer science in Wuhan city.  Ashish and Neha  who were married in 2018  have been in touch with their families in UP by sending video messages almost daily. They are in panic as they are unable to move out of their building due to the lockdown in Wuhan. In a message to her family  Neha said: “We alerted the Indian Embassy about our situation. Before the January 22 lockdown of Wuhan  we were told that since the coronavirus incubation period is just 14 days  the situation will normalise by first week of February. But the situation has now become critical. “Two flights were arranged by the Indian government on January 31 and February 1 to evacuate Indians stranded in Wuhan after the outbreak of Novel Corona Virus. My wife had to undergo a minor surgery and was advised post-surgery rest. Thus we could not be evacuated by the Indian government ” said Ashish Yadav on phone from Wuhan city. “The situation here is frightening as we are not allowed to move out of the building where we reside. We have appealed to the Indian government to evacuate us and other Indians still stranded in Wuhan city ” stated Yadav. “We are ready to pay for our return journey and so are the others (about two dozen) who are waiting to return to India. Till now  no concrete help has come forth though local leaders in India have taken up our cause with the ministry in India ” added Yadav.

07/02/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;mali;united states,IVRI working on vaccine for bovine coronavirus,,BAREILLY After successfully developing a vaccine to control classical swine fever last week  scientists at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)  Bareilly are now working on a vaccine for bovine coronavirus. BCoV (bovine coronavirus) affects livestock and a vaccine for it  according to IVRI scientists  is available in the United States and some other countries but has to be imported and is very expensive. “We intend to develop our own cost-effective vaccine. It should be ready within a year ” said IVRI director RK Singh. BCoV is a major cause of calf scours and winter dysentery in adult cows. Research and improvements in diagnostic testing increasingly indicate BCoV also plays a role as a primary viral agent in a significant percentage of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases  according to IVRI scientists. The virus spreads in an animal after it drinks polluted water. Usually  the carriers of this virus are camels  cows  buffaloes and kittens. “It causes diarrhoea and could lead to death of the calves and impacts growth of cattle ” said Singh  adding that BCoV was prevalent across the country. Diarrohea weakens the immune system of the infected livestock and leads to death within a week. He said the disease was detected in cattle a couple of years ago and ever since research on the virus was going on. “As of now  we cannot say for sure whether the (corona) virus  which is spreading in humans  is the same virus which is found in animals or something else. If it is spreading from animals to humans  then we will have to find out from which animals this virus is spreading in humans ” said Singh. Conference on challenges A national conference on “Challenges and threats of microbes to animals and humans” was held at IVRI on Thursday. Commenting on the novel coronavirus (2019-NCoV) which has spread from China  Gurdial Singh  vice-chancellor  Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences  said  “Novel coronavirus may have spread after consumption of wild bats. Unlike India  people in China consume raw meat and do not cook it properly.” The conference was attended by more than 350 researchers from across the country involved in vaccine production.  In the inaugural session  many problems plaguing human and animal health were discussed with special emphasis on the spread of coronavirus. Speakers emphasized on the development of rapid onsite diagnostics and multivalent vaccines for various animal diseases.  Dr Rameshwar Singh  vice chancellor  Bihar Animal Sciences University  Patna was the guest of honor and in his address  he highlighted the impact of zoonotic infections on both human and animal health. Dr Nagendra Sharma  former vice-chancellor of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology  Jammu reminisced about the glorious contributions of IVRI in controlling various animal diseases at national and international level.  Dr. Rajkumar Singh  director cum vice-chancellor  IVRI  in his presidential address emphasized on development of vaccines for the emerging infectious diseases. He also advised house-to-work on probiotics and phage therapy to combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance.  During the inaugural session Dr Rameshwar Singh was honoured with lifetime achievement award. Dr Aniket Sanyal  joint director Bengaluru campus  IVRI  Dr V C Ingle  prof and Dr YPS Malik  national fellow  were bestowed with fellowship.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ivri-working-on-vaccine-for-bovine-coronavirus/story-TLlh1LPvJYCQdScMIQOdQJ.html
07/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india,Coronavirus: In God's Own Country  the biggest casualty is tourism,Hotels  travel companies in Kerala have lost businesses worth crores,Kerala  India's ground zero for the novel coronavirus  has been hit where it hurts the most - the state's tourism industry. Gifted with sweeping mountains  rolling tea estates  tranquil backwaters  and pristine beaches  Kerala’s tourism potential is recognised globally. It is a  Rs 35 000 crore cash cow  providing jobs to 1.5 million. Tourism accounts for 40% in revenues of the state’s services sector  the mainstay of the economy. Kerala saw 1.67 crore visitors last year  according to the latest economic survey  despite the double-whammy of the Nipah outbreak and the unprecedented floods in 2018 and 2019 that ravaged the state. Things are different this season. Chinese fishing nets against the Fort Kochi skyline no longer overlook luxury cruises  while beaches and bars are bereft of customers. Small ferries and houseboats in the famed backwaters of Kuttanad float at anchor  alongside the home-stays that employ them  and Kathakali dancers are jobless. The elephants are idle too. Among the biggest hotel chains in Kerala  one saw cancellations worth  Rs 2.5 crore on Wednesday  and another lost businesses worth  Rs 5 crore earlier in the week  according to a state government employee who is tasked with tabulating data from each district  requesting not to be named. “Until corona(virus)  we were actually seeing great numbers. The December-January peak season had bookings extended till March. But they are either getting postponed or simply cancelled now ” the person said. More than a month after it was first identified in Wuhan  China  in late December  the novel coronavirus continues to confound experts  with no clarity yet on the source of the virus. Lack of effective countermeasures and vaccines has not helped the matters.  Efforts are on to contain the spread of the virus and the World Health Organization has declared it a global public health emergency. But the virus has proved tricky - there are now 31 377 confirmed cases in 27 countries while the death toll has touched 638. In India  three cases have been confirmed  all in Kerala with no casualties so far.  And there lies the irony. The first outbreak of the deadly  brain-damaging Nipah virus in 2018 killed 17 people  the floods claimed hundreds.  The three who have tested positive for the virus remain in isolation  cut off from the rest of the world. Yet  for the international visitor  the state poses danger. Kerala declaring a “state calamity”  rattled by the virus  and tightening quarantine efforts  has done little to calm the fears. Doubling down on prevention was the sensible thing to do  but it has added to the fears of already squeamish travellers. Gopinath Parayil  founder of travel company Blue Yonder  said it has become harder for small and medium tour operators to manage. He lost a booking worth  Rs 4.5 lakh this week  and his agency now employs two people instead of 12 earlier. But  he believes  there is a way out. The state government's handling of the repeated crises have underscored Kerala's image of a responsible host but could do with better marketing  Payaril said. “The government is laying out a strong protocol as they did with Nipah. The way it's done is transparent and accountable. That's what makes us a responsible destination. Tour operators or travellers will prefer to go to a place that's acknowledging a problem and being proactive than to a place that's hiding information to save the temporary image " he said. “The positioning of Kerala should be based on its resilience. That's the future ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/coronavirus-in-god-s-own-country-the-biggest-casualty-is-tourism/story-z4SUUU1yFpG6Mh53SSzj3N.html
06/02/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,AFMC to host one of Defence ministry’s 10 new labs dedicated to virus research,,PUNE The Ministry of Defence has begun work on setting up 10 new laboratories across the country  primarily to conduct research on viruses.  “The labs  which were already in the pipeline  have recently been sanctioned ” said Lt General Anup Banerji  director-general  Armed Forces Medical Services  during a media interaction on Thursday at the 68th Armed Forces Medical Conference in Pune. Banerji said  “We are treating Corona virus as a national emergency and as part of the armed forces we are putting in all efforts to control it. We have also set up 60 centres in the Northeast to reach people in far flung areas and provide them medical services if required.” While the locations of the laboratories are yet to be decided  one of them will be located inside Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune  said a senior defence official  requesting anonymity  adding that the labs will work on research  diagnosis and treatment of new and existing viruses  accessing medical expertise from within the defence staff.  The official further clarified that these laboratories were already in the pipeline and are not being set up for the Coronavirus  but they will definitely help in tackling this national health issue. As per information released at the press meet  the 10 laboratories will be set by the Defence ministry in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).  The labs will exist in a three tier-structure - national  state and district level - and will work on virus detection and treatment on the lines of the National Institute of Virology (NIV).  Established in Pune in 1952  NIV  under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)  is involved in the research of arthropod borne viruses.

05/02/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china,Coronavirus: Chips  display panels could get more expensive,China  where the outbreak originated  is home to manufacturing facilities of many of South Korea’s major tech firms  including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc.,The spread of coronavirus in China is likely to push up prices of semiconductors and display panels  analysts said on Wednesday  amid possible supply chain disruptions of key industrial materials. China  where the outbreak originated  is home to manufacturing facilities of many of South Korea's major tech firms  including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc. The companies said they are trying to keep their plants in China running amid the spread of the deadly coronavirus  while setting up contingency plans to prepare for the worst situation  Yonhap news agency reported. So far  490 people have died of the coronavirus  with over 23 000 confirmed cases around the world. Industry observers said that chip production in China is expected to see a limited impact from the coronavirus as factories there are operating as usual. Samsung runs a NAND flash plant in Xian  800 km northwest of Wuhan  the central Chinese city where the outbreak started. SK hynix Inc. operates chip plants in Wuxi and Chongqing  both also roughly 800 km away from Wuhan. "Basically  chip production depends more on utilization of facilities rather than human labour " said Lee Seung-woo  an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co.. "Since they are far away from Wuhan  there will be no direct impact." ALSO READ: Coronavirus outbreak: LG  ZTE pull out of MWC 2020 Market research firm TrendForce also predicted recently that overall production of memory chips  such as DRAM and NAND flash  is likely to remain unaffected by the deadly virus in the short term  although it suggested that the companies need to monitor closely whether the potential spread of the virus can affect logistics and transportation systems in China and subsequently cause a nationwide material shortage. Industry insiders said that what's more concerning at this point is a slowdown in chip demand in China  the world's largest semiconductor market  as the virus will hurt consumer sentiment in the world's second-largest economy. "It's estimated that smartphone sales in China during the Lunar New Year holiday dropped more than 50 percent from a year ago " Lee said. "It's also important to monitor whether the Chinese government extends its national holiday period and affects the production schedules of handset makers." China's Lunar New Year holiday started on January 25 and usually lasts for a week  but Beijing recently decided to extend it until this week  with some cities considering further extension of the break. As uncertainties are growing on both the supply and demand sides of the market  analysts predicted that chip prices will go up this year.  "Demand for chips has not disappeared  but been delayed " said Lee Su-bin  an analyst at Daishin Securities Co. "Once demand recovers in the second half  prices of memory chips  particularly NAND flash  will sharply rise." ALSO READ: Coronavirus outbreak: Samsung to shut down its experience store in China Unlike chipmakers  South Korean display panel producers are likely to see some production disruption from the coronavirus outbreak since the industry requires more of human labour  analysts said. LG Display Co. said it has decided not to operate its display module plants in Yentai and Nanjing until Sunday  citing a labour shortage due to the Chinese government's Lunar New Year holiday extension. Samsung Display Co. runs a plant in Suzhou  but has lowered its utilisation rate  according to the company officials. Despite concerns of output cut  analysts  however  said the outbreak of the novel coronavirus could deliver a positive impact to display manufacturers since it can solve a supply glut in the LCD industry and push up product prices. China accounts for 55 per cent of global display panel production  according to market researcher IHS Markit  which also predicted that the utilisation rate for China's LCD factories could drop by as much as 20 per cent in February. "Even though their production volume could be reduced  it's likely that the coronavirus will deliver a negative impact on display makers' earnings since display panel prices could go up " said Chung Won-suk  an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities Co.. Local display makers have been trying to convert its LCD production facilities to OLED facilities in recent years as Chinese manufacturers started to dominate the LCD industry. Analysts predicted that LG Display's move to expand its OLED production could suffer since the company's plan to ramp up its Guangzhou could face delays due to the coronavirus outbreak. LG Display was expected to fully operate its Guangzhou OLED plant in the first quarter.  Follow HT Tech for the latest tech news and reviews  also keep up with us on Twitter  Facebook  and Instagram.

01/02/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;malaysia;philippines;singapore,Tokyo 2020: Shuttlers wary of virus threat,Though the epidemic has affected several sports with tournaments and leagues getting cancelled  shifted or postponed  badminton could be one of the worst affected in the time to come since the sport is dominated by Asians.,India’s top badminton doubles specialist Chirag Shetty has been closely following news of the novel coronavirus  because it can directly affect his playing plans over the next few months. Having already claimed at least 213 lives—all in China—the new virus has spread across the world with 24 countries reporting a total of over 9 900 confirmed cases  mostly in east and southeast Asia  the region that also happens to be epicentre for global badminton. Though the epidemic has affected several sports with tournaments and leagues getting cancelled  shifted or postponed  badminton could be one of the worst affected in the time to come since the sport is dominated by Asians. Eight of the top 10 ranked players in both men’s and women’s singles are Asians. In doubles  all the top 10 in all three categories—men’s  women’s and mixed—are also from Asia. China is also scheduled to host two tournaments in the upcoming months—the $90 000 China Masters (February) in Lingshui and Badminton Asia Championships (April) in the epicentre of the epidemic  Wuhan. Both are crucial ranking tournaments for players hoping to make the Olympic cut. The top 16 men’s and women’s singles players and the top 8 in the doubles categories in the Race to Tokyo rankings will qualify to play the Olympics. The Race to Tokyo rankings will be calculated on the basis of performances in tournaments from April 28 2019 to April 28 2020. “If it’s dangerous we will most probably not (travel to China) because we are a lot more comfortable in the standings ” said Shetty  who is currently ranked No.7 in the Race to Tokyo men’s doubles rankings with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and in all likelihood will qualify for the Games. “They (BWF) might take a step… most probably shift it. If the virus is still there it’s definitely not going to happen in Wuhan.” HT sent a list of questions to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) regarding the matter following which they issued a statement  saying that they are closely monitoring implications related to the coronavirus outbreak in “China and surrounding areas with all necessary health  safety and travel precautions currently being considered”. The world body also took note of several airlines suspending flights to and from China  “mindful of the complications this may have on the BWF World Tour”. “Currently  no decision has yet been made on any change in status to the China Masters scheduled to take place between February 25 to March 1 in Lingshui  but the BWF is working with local organisers and the Chinese Badminton Association to create greater clarity around any risks ” said the statement. Though China Masters is a small tournament (BWF Tour Super 100)  the Badminton Asia Championships—held every year in Wuhan since 2015—is a significant competition offering a combined prize purse of $400 000. More importantly  the tournament falls within the Tokyo 2020 qualification window and is one of the last opportunities for athletes to qualify for the Olympics. Unlike the highly ranked Shetty and Rankireddy who can afford to miss a tournament or two  mixed doubles exponents Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy do not have that luxury. At No.35 in the Race to Tokyo rankings  they will have to play as many tournaments to garner as many points to try and qualify for the Olympics. “We are not playing the China Masters but will definitely play the Badminton Asia Championships in Wuhan. We are just hoping Badminton Asia (BA) takes a call and changes the venue because this is a very important period ” said the seasoned Chopra  who is playing in the Premier Badminton League (PBL) for Mumbai Rockets. “We can just hope for the best as we don’t have an option. Tournaments are there and this is the Olympic qualification period. I don’t think anyone would want to miss out. We will see if the tournament still happens in Wuhan or not.” The BWF stated that it is in talks with the organisers but it is “too early” to take a final call. “The BWF can also confirm that Badminton Asia is reviewing its flagship event  the Badminton Asia Championships to be staged in Wuhan and the BWF will support Badminton Asia and the Chinese Badminton Association in this process ” added the statement. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) said they are in talks with the authorities regarding the matter. “I don’t think the tournament (Badminton Asia Championships) will go ahead. We are talking to the (sports) ministry and Sports Authority of India (SAI). After consultation  we will instruct the players ” said BAI general secretary Ajay Kumar Singhania. In Singapore  which has so far confirmed 16 cases  players are already taking precautions. “We check our temperature every day with a thermometer. Besides that we are also wearing masks ” said Singapore chief coach Mulyo Handoyo  who was also India foreign coach in 2017. Indian shuttlers too are worried. “My physiotherapist was telling me that we need to be careful and if someone is not well then better stay away ” said Chopra  who won the mixed team gold at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. “Even if we are not going to China we will still meet the players. I just hope the Chinese players are not affected. They stay and train there (Wuhan). The virus has already spread to other countries where we have tournaments lined up like Malaysia and Singapore. We will try and take all precautions  whichever possible.” The Indian badminton contingent’s next destination with Olympic qualification in mind is the Philippines  which confirmed its first coronavirus case on Thursday. Manila will host the Badminton Asia Team Championships from February 11-16. “I have had some discussions regarding this with Saina (Nehwal) and our parents about wearing a mask ” said 2014 Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap  who is also Nehwal’s husband and coach. Nehwal  currently ranked 22 in Race to Tokyo  is in a tough qualification fight.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/tokyo-2020-shuttlers-wary-of-virus-threat/story-BwvlDFyvcOb6RTe4IZpSIM.html

28/01/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;japan;nepal;singapore;thailand;united states,All you need to know about China’s spreading Coronavirus outbreak,Symptoms vary from mild symptoms like fever  cough and malaise to severe pneumonia  kidney failure and death. The disease seems to relatively mild but if the transmission capability of the virus is huge then given the size of the world population  it could have significant impact.,A new virus  by the name of Coronavirus has put the world and health agencies all around the globe on high alert. It all started on 31 December 2019  when the World Health Organisation  (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in China’s Wuhan City  in the Hubei Province. The virus did not match any other known virus. The new virus is a corona virus  which is a family of viruses that include the common cold  and viruses such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome). This new virus was temporarily named “2019-nCoV.” The virus is also known colloquially known as the “Wuhan coronavirus” after the city where it is believed to have originated. The disease is still very poorly understood  and seems to be changing rapidly. Updates from China  Thailand  Korea  and Japan indicate that the disease associated with 2019-nCoV appears to be relatively mild as compared with SARS and MERS. The symptoms vary from mild symptoms like fever  cough and malaise to severe pneumonia  kidney failure and death. The disease seems to relatively mild but if the transmission capability of the virus is huge then given the size of the world population  it could have significant national and international impact. The exact source of the virus is still unknown  but the first case most likely came from contact with a non-human animal host in Wuhan.  As of January 24  2020  at least 830 cases had been diagnosed in nine countries: China  Thailand  Japan  South Korea  Singapore  Vietnam  Taiwan  Nepal  and the United States. Twenty-six fatalities occurred  mainly in patients who had serious underlying illness. Not enough is known about the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV to draw definitive conclusions about the full clinical features of disease  the intensity of the human-to-human transmission  and the original source of the outbreak. New confirmed cases will continue to appear in other areas and countries. Just like the SARS outbreak in China back in 2003 which claimed around 800 lives  the Coronavirus Outbreak also began from a ‘wet’ seafood market (which sells both live and dead animals). The food market where China’s deadly coronavirus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets  a Chinese local media reported. It sold animal-based products including foxes  snakes  crocodiles  rats  peacocks. While the Coronavirus is said to have links from bats  it is likely that the host of the infection in Wuhan was snakes. Treatment and Prevention  Dr Sanjay Wazir  the Director of the Neonatal intensive care unit and a paediatrician at Cloudnine Group of Hospitals in Gurgaon  has given the following methods to help aid in trying to prevent from contracting the virus  and also possible treatments for the same.  Dr Wazir says that when it comes to cases of viral pneumonia  antibiotics do not work. He said  “There is no medicated treatment or drugs for the disease. The only treatment that can be given is putting the patient on a ventilator and ensuring enough oxygen supply reaches the lungs. The patient is also made to drink lots of fluids to push out the infection from the system. There is no need for any other medicine as the body can recuperate from the infection on its own.” While the government of India has instructed that all flight passengers arriving from China to the airports at Delhi  Mumbai  Kolkata  Chennai  Bengaluru  Hyderabad and Kochi airports should be screened regularly  it is always best to be safe than sorry and we must take necessary precautions ourselves. Talking about  WHO’s standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses  he elaborated on them saying safe practices include hand and respiratory hygiene  and safe food practices. Here are some tips shared by Dr Wazir.  •Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; •When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; •Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; •If you have fever  cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; •When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus  avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals. •The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat  milk or animal organs should be handled with care  to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods  as per good food safety practices.

28/01/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india;qatar,Centre puts entire stake of Air India on the block,The Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM)  headed by Union home minister Amit Shah  approved the release of the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) for inviting EOI for the disinvestment move.,The government on Monday announced a plan to sell its entire stake in Air India  renewing its attempt to sell the state-owned airline after a similar move in 2018 failed to attract any bidder. A document released by the government on Monday invited initial expressions of interest (EOI) in the airline and set March 17 as the deadline for the submissions. The Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM)  headed by Union home minister Amit Shah  approved the release of the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) for inviting EOI for the disinvestment move. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the airline was a “great asset” and its position was “fragile” due to heavy debt. He said Air India  as a brand  will continue to fly but it needs to be privatised. “Due to its accumulated debt of about ₹60 000 crore  its financial position is in a very fragile condition and Air India is currently under a debt trap. Any private investor can turn it around and make Air India a profitable venture by bringing operational as well as financial efficiencies. The government has limited financial resources whereas the private investor can bring the required capital to make it turnaround. We hope and wish that Air India remains a vibrant airline and fly forever ” Puri said. Monday’s announcement only marks the first of a multi-stage process. The government has given time till February 11 for the submission of written queries on PIM and the share purchase agreement (SPA) while the last date for submission of the expression of interest is March 17. It will announce the qualified bidders on March 31 following which the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued. The government has not yet announced the date for the RFP stage.  The move is also a politically contentious one. The Congress criticised the Centre over the move. “The sale of Air India has been going on for the last six years since 2014 when this government assumed office. A special group of ministers (GoM) was formed to look into it. Five ministers deliberated on it. If the government seriously wants to sell Air India  they should look for a real investor and have to go for a real strategic sale. The government has been misleading on the issue ” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said. CPI general secretary D Raja blamed the government’s “bad policies” and maintained that the national carrier has the potential to emerge as a powerhouse in the aviation sector. Experts also said the timing of the Centre’s move amid an economic slowdown could pose a challenge.  “While divestment is a positive step  it has to be when you have a strong platform  not with a wobbly economic base. After the first failed attempt  it makes sense for the government to divest and find a company that can help make the Maharaja stronger... And this should be done especially when we have a positive economic climate. At the moment  the investment sentiment with India is not conducive… There are several external risk factors also in aviation such as oil prices  the Iranian crisis and the corona virus outbreak  etc. ” said Mark Martin  founder and CEO of Martin Consulting  an aviation consultancy. As part of the strategic disinvestment  Air India plans to sell its entire stake in Air India Express and 50% shareholding in equal joint venture Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS). All the three will be sold together and management control of the national carrier will be transferred to the investor  the government said. The government previously offered only 76% of its stake for sale. In November  Puri told Parliament that the national carrier  which loses ₹26 crore a day  would have to shut down if it was not privatised. In 2018-19  Air India’s net loss was provisionally estimated at ₹8 556.35 crore. It has a debt of over ₹60 000 crore  half of which has already been taken out of the books and parked in a special purpose vehicle  Air India Assets Holding Ltd.  In its latest plan  the government will target selling its entire stake in the airline and 50% of a ground handling unit. The successful bidder will have to take only a debt of ₹23 286.5 crore (the 2018 offer required them to take on a little over ₹33 000 crore)   while the liabilities will be decided depending on current assets at the time of closing of the transaction  according to the PIM. The remaining amount of the total ₹60 074 crore debt  as on March 31  2019  will be transferred to the special purpose vehicle. The firm’s land and buildings at the Delhi and Mumbai airports and the corporate office  which are core assets for running the airline  will be given to the new investor on a right-to-use basis for a limited period  the document added. Puri said that after no bids were received for the national carrier in the first attempt made in 2018  the government learnt its “lessons and analysed critical areas to make the current disinvestment bid more attractive to the prospective Interested Bidders (IBs)”. The government in 2018 called bids for a 76% stake sale in Air India including 100% in subsidiary Air India Express and 50% holding in ground handling company AISATS but failed to get even a single bid amid reports of a consortium of Indigo (Interglobe Aviation) and Qatar Airways being interested. Air India and Air India Express had combined revenue of ₹30 632 crore in 2018-19  which is the highest among Indian carriers  Puri said. The government said it was committed to paying certain employee-related dues before the closing of transaction. The total employee strength of the two companies is 17 984  out of which 9 617 are permanent employees. About 36% of the permanent employees will be retiring in the next five years  Puri said. The government has relaxed the bidding norms wherein net worth for potential bidders is fixed at ₹3 500 crore and minimum stake for an individual consortium partner is lowered to 10%. The net worth criterion was ₹5 000 crore in the 2018 bid document.  Another key change is that an entity can put in a bid on the “strength of its parent”  which means that an entity floated by a big corporate can participate in the disinvestment process  a person aware of the PIM details told Press Trust of India.  Staff dues of about ₹1 383.70 crore on account of Justice Dharmadhikari Commission’s recommendation on past arrears will be paid by the government. As per the conditions decided by AISAM  the liabilities to be retained in Air India will be equal to certain current and non-current assets.

27/01/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;hong kong;india;mali,Fourth person quarantined at Mumbai for suspected coronavirus symptoms,The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation has formed an expert team who would help the doctors in case of emergency or outbreak of corona virus.,A 36-year-old resident of Tardeo  who had visited China recently  was quarantined at Mumbai’s Kasturba Gandhi Hospital on Sunday after he developed cold and fever  symptoms of the coronavirus. He is the fourth person in Mumbai to be quarantined in the hospital’s isolation ward.  The man had travelled to China on January 3  2020  and returned on January 11  2020 through Hong Kong. During his stay  he has visited Shanghai and Guangzhou which is almost 1 000 km away from Wuhan city  which has reported highest number of cases. Though he did not have any symptoms when he returned  he was observed by health workers through the telephone. On Sunday night  when he complained of fever  he was immediately rushed to the isolation ward at the hospital.  “The patient has fever for the last five days and on Sunday night  he also developed fever. So  we decided to keep him under observation as a precaution. But he hasn’t travelled to affected provinces so  we believe it’s just a case of viral fever ” said Dr Padmaja Keskar  executive health officer  BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).  His medical sample has been sent to National Institute of Virology for analysis. However  the report of the third suspected patient has come negative of the new strain of the coronavirus - nCOV. A 61-year-old resident of Nalasopara was the third patient to be quarantined at the hospital for observation. He returned from Hong Kong on January 9 and developed cold and fever. Even though  Hong Kong hasn’t reported any confirmed case of coronavirus  the health officials kept him under observation as a precautionary measure.  “We haven’t got the report in hand which requires a series formalities but the institute informed us on Sunday that the third report has also being found negative. These reports would also be submitted to the central health department for their observation ” said Dr Padmaja Keskar  executive health officer  BMC.  BMC has kept another three people on observation through telephonic follow up who landed in Mumbai on Sunday after visiting China. But as they didn’t exhibite any symptoms like the three suspected quatentined patients  they have been kept on telephonic observation.  “Our health officials would follow up with them to check if they develop any symptoms of coronavirus. This is done as a precautionary measures ” added Dr Keskar.  One of the two admitted on Thursday is a 31-year-old marketing professional from Nalasopara  who had complained of body ache and cold two days after returning to Mumbai from Foshan  China  on January 21. Although she did not have any symptoms when she landed  she was in touch with public health officials on the telephone. On January 23  when she developed symptoms  she was moved to the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital. The other patient at the facility was a 36-year-old man from Kalyan  an information technology professional  who had travelled to Guangzhou in China on January 16  when he already had cold and fever. He had been in contact with Indian public health officials over the phone. After taking medicines  his condition improved  but on January 22  when he landed in Mumbai  his body temperature was still high  so he was quarantined as a precaution.  However  as HT reported earlier  the three quatentined patients would be under observation at the hospital until the state health department formulates a discharge policy. “We are in talks with the experts from the central government in formulating a discharge policy for the suspected patients suffering from the new strain of coronavirus. Until then they would be kept under observation ” said Dr Archana Patil  Dr Archana Patil  additional director of health services  State Family Welfare Bureau. For those with a weakened immune system  the elderly and the very young  there’s a chance the virus could cause a lower  and much more serious  respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis. There are currently no vaccines available to protect one against human coronavirus infection or treatments for illnesses caused by it. On January 9  the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan city  China.  In the meantime  BMC has formed an expert team consisting of epidemiologists  microbiologists  medicine  chest specialists who would be stationed at Kasturba hospital to deal with emergency or outbreak of coronavirus.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fourth-person-quarantined-at-mumbai-for-suspected-coronavirus-symptoms/story-uzozeY3eDsN65164fR5LmK.html

25/01/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,nepal;china;india,Tackling corona virus - Set up check posts along Nepal border  screening at airports not enough: Doctor,,GORAKHPUR/VARANASI  “Checking persons at airports alone is not a foolproof measure to check entry of the deadly corona virus into the country. To be absolutely sure  it is essential to establish screening camps at the open Indo-Nepal border ” said city-based paediatrician RN Singh  who known for launching a campaign against encephalitis.  “It is well known that a large number of travellers  tourists and Lord Buddha followers visit India from Nepal. The risk is high as most of them come from affected countries like China. The health check posts along the porous border will screen them for infection and isolate or keep them under observation during their stay here in India. Till now  there is no such check on these entries. It can cause an epidemic if overlooked ” he said. Dr Singh said that in 2002-03 when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) broke out  authorities from the immigration department had set up health check posts at Sonauli-Bhairawa border  helping India stop spread of the disease on this side. Screening begins at Varanasi airport  VARANASI: An alert has been sounded at the Lal Bahadur Shashtri International Airport  Varanasi  on Saturday  in view of the viral outbreak in China. A team of doctors has been deployed at the airport for screening passengers coming from foreign countries  especially China  where cases and fatalities related to corona virus have been reported. LBS airport director Akashdeep Mathur said  “Preventive measures have been taken and passengers (coming from foreign countries) are being screened by a team of medical experts as a preventive measure.” He said that the medical team  made available by the health department  has set up an isolation chamber at the airport. The team is equipped with medicines  he added. In case  a person is found showing symptoms of corona virus  he/she will kept in the isolation chamber and will be treated.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tackling-corona-virus-set-up-check-posts-along-nepal-border-screening-at-airports-not-enough-doctor/story-la1oVz8CtUe2fhSDA16tIJ.html
24/01/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;japan;thailand,Coronavirus in city: Three Punekars back from China under telephonic medical supervision,All returned from Wuhan and flew in to Mumbai  says state health dept official,Three people from Pune who recently returned from China’s Wuhan have been kept under telephonic medical supervision by doctors from the state health ministry for possible Coronavirus infection. Although all three do not show any signs or symptoms’ of being infected through the virus  the state health ministry is keeping a check on them through telephonic supervision. State health director Archana Patil said  “All three have recently returned from Wuhan in China. This is the third day of their return from China and although they have not showed any symptoms of being affected by the virus  we are keeping a check on them through telephonic supervision. They have been sent to their homes from Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport when they returned from China.” Patil refused to disclose any information regarding the patients but confirmed that they were least possible to be infected by the virus. Since the outbreak of Corona virus  ministry of health and state government has issued strict guidelines and advisory to civic bodies and government hospitals. Wuhan was one of the first places to be hit by the new virus named Coronavirus. This respiratory disease spreads through air by exposure to cough droplets of the infected person. The symptoms include cold  cough  difficulty in breathing  and pneumonia. Till now China  Japan  South Korea  Thailand and America have reported corona virus infected patients. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official Sanjay Wavare from the health department said  “Since there are no direct flights from China to Pune  all the visitors and people returning from China are being screened at the Mumbai airport itself and accordingly being screened or sent to their native places. No case has been detected yet from Pune.”  Isolation wards prepped at Naidu  Sassoon hospitals  In view of the coronavirus scare  the civic-run Naidu hospital and the state government-run Sassoon general hospital will start isolation wards with infection prevention facilities.  The nursing staff in these hospitals has been trained for necessary precaution and safety procedure in case any infected patient or a suspected patient is admitted in these wards. Dr Sanjay Wavare  assistant health commissioner  said  “The isolation wards will have approximately six to seven cots and will be separate from the rest of the patients. The nursing staff will be trained to provide basic nursing care for these patients and so accordingly the facilities will be provided.” Wavare further added that the staff will also be issued guidelines as to identify symptoms and take necessary precaution while attending to these patients. He further said  “It is not quite likely that any infected person would come to the city as all visitors from China and infected countries are being screened at the Mumbai airport. Also  if anyone is suspected of being infected then they are being admitted to Mumbai’s Kasturba hospital for further treatment. So there is hardly any chance that the virus would enter the city.” Wavare further said that any suspected patients or person returning from China is kept under supervision for over 28 days and also it is not likely that the symptoms appear late.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-in-pune-under-telephonic-medical-supervision-for-corona-virus/story-bvCGSKz2uaNCgl0DLuK1PL.html
23/01/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india;china;philippines,Virus attack: Wuhan loses boxing Olympic qualifier,The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has thrown its hat in the ring  opening up the possibility of the qualifiers being shifted to India.,The Olympic qualifying event for boxing  scheduled from Feb 3-14 in Wuhan  has been cancelled following the coronavirus outbreak in China. The IOC’s boxing task force said in a statement that it had “noted the decision of the local organising committee to cancel the Asian/ Oceania Tokyo 2020 Tokyo boxing qualifying event amid growing concerns in relation with the corona virus outbreak reported in the city.” An alternative venue has not been announced. The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has thrown its hat in the ring  opening up the possibility of the qualifiers being shifted to India. “We had a long discussion with members of the (International Olympic Committee) taskforce on Tuesday over the issue and we have given them the option that Delhi can host it if the event is moved out of China ” Boxing Federation of India (BFI) executive director RK Sacheti  who is part of an expert group set up to advise the taskforce  said. The coronavirus outbreak originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan  and has left at least nine people dead and hundreds infected. WHO meeting It remains to be seen whether China would be looking to hold the qualifiers in another city. The women’s football qualifier for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was also scheduled in Wuhan from Feb 3-9  but was moved to Nanjing in a decision taken on Wednesday. Sacheti said the taskforce is looking at various options and will also keep an eye on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency meeting on the outbreak. Besides India  there are reports that the Philippines are also interested in hosting the qualifier. If the taskforce decides to shift it out of China and hold it in India  a team will visit to check the facilities before giving the go-ahead. It will require some effort from the BFI to organise it as time is short. “We know it will be a big task logistically and the event might have to be postponed ” Sancheti said. “We said we can hold it on the same dates  but then visa was an issue. We said we can give them e-visas  but even then the process will take some time. The taskforce team will come and see the venue. The equipment and all other paraphernalia will have to be brought in  so it might get postponed by 5-10 days.” If the qualifiers are shifted to Delhi  it will provide Indian boxers a great opportunity to compete on home turf and seal Olympic berths. The men will contest in eight weight classes and women in five. There will be a second qualification event after this one  a global competition in Paris from May 13-24.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/virus-attack-wuhan-loses-boxing-olympic-qualifier/story-VvKsjut571pEec1lnmqHpI.html
21/01/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;japan;thailand,Human transmission confirmed  arrivals from China under lens,In India  health ministry officials reached out to the embassy in China and to immigration officials for details of inbound travellers from the affected regions  including foreigners as well as Indian citizens.,Officials in China confirmed on Monday that humans can be infected by other humans with the new  fast-spreading virus that has triggered alarm bells across the world  including in India where officials have now begun a sweeping identification of people who are or may be flying in from any Chinese city.  According to officials in Beijing  14 medical staff have been infected by the previously unseen coronavirus  the number of patients has more than trebled  and new infections have been reported from more Chinese cities – confirming fears that the virus is highly contagious.  In India  health ministry officials reached out to the embassy in China and to immigration officials for details of inbound travellers from the affected regions  including foreigners as well as Indian citizens.  Among them are at least 500 Indians studying in medical colleges in Wuhan  the ground zero for the outbreak.  “There are apparently close to 500 students in different medical colleges; we have asked the officials there to send us the list. Immigration has also been alerted here; anyone coming from China will be screened irrespective of the reason of travel ” said a senior health ministry official  asking not to be named. According to the official  people arriving from China are being subjected to thermal screening at the seven international airports that have inbound connections to Chinese cities: Delhi  Mumbai  Kolkata  Chennai  Bengaluru  Hyderabad and Kochi. Screening at the first three have been on since Friday. Till now  the thermal screening has not led to any infection being detected  the official added. The department has also written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA) for details of all visas sought from Wuhan since December 31  2019  the official added. “As for e-Visas  the ministry of home affairs is being approached ” this person said. Representatives from the foreign ministry did not respond to requests for a comment. Adding to the difficulties of containing the virus  hundreds of millions will be travelling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week.  This is also the time when most foreign students travel back to their countries during this time of the year. The outbreak appeared to widen as officials in China said the virus has spread to more cities  including the capital Beijing and Shanghai  while the number of patients more than tripled and a third person died.  Zhong Nanshan  director of China’s State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease  said transmission between humans was behind at least one confirmed case in Wuhan – a city that was connected to at least 95% of the cases — and also infections in two families in south China’s Guangdong province. Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday the country will focus on curbing the spread  state television reported.  “People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed ” it quoted Xi as saying. The confirmation of person-to-person transmission is worrying because it could accelerate the spread of the virus  which  until now  was believed to be purely zoonotic (spreading from animals to humans).  The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that also started in China.  Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing  which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.  The WHO also said that the situation was still evolving  and preliminary investigations suggested link to a seafood market in Wuhan. “Coronaviruses are highly infectious and very prone to mutation; it’s difficult to predict their behaviour. Since it is an acute respiratory tract infection  its spread is easy and fast. However  India doesn’t need to panic as of now ” said Dr Ekta Gupta  senior microbiologist at a Delhi government-run hospital. With the infection spreading to other countries such as Japan and Thailand  India on Friday issued a travel advisory asking passengers to maintain personal hygiene such as hand washing  and follow respiratory etiquettes such as covering mouth when coughing or sneezing.  “…one should avoid contact with live animals and consumption of raw and undercooked meats. Also  as far as possible avoid travel to farms  live animal markets or where animals are slaughtered ” Indian authorities advised passengers travelling from the region. According to the health ministry official quoted above  hospitals attached to the seven airports that have incoming flights from Chinese cities has been reviewed for provisions of isolation and critical care facilities.  “Immigration officers manning the counters have been sensitised at these airports ” the official said. An official from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed there has been no sample lifted of any suspected case for testing so far. “There is no evidence of human to human transmission as of now. It appears to be a new zoonotic Corona virus  and the current pattern suggests that the new strain isn’t as virulent as H1N1 that broke out in 2009. However  we are prepared to investigate if necessary ” said the official.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-transmission-confirmed-arrivals-from-china-under-lens/story-5iytAQ8uCXeFtj3DXe8clK.html
13/01/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;hong kong;oman;thailand,First case of deadly SARS-like virus found outside China  says UN,The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome)  which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003.,A new virus from the same family as the deadly SARS disease has spread beyond China’s borders for the first time with a case emerging in Thailand  UN and Thai officials said on Monday. Thai doctors diagnosed a Chinese traveller with mild pneumonia on January 8 later confirmed to have been caused by the so-called novel coronavirus -- which has already given rise to 41 pneumonia-like cases and one death in China. The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome)  which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The UN health agency (WHO) confirmed that the outbreak in the city of Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of corona virus  a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. “Laboratory testing subsequently confirmed that the novel coronavirus was the cause ” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email  referring to the case in Thailand. WHO said it might soon host an emergency meeting on the spread of the new virus. Thai Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul stressed to reporters in Bangkok Monday that a 61-year-old Chinese woman who had travelled from Wuhan “was infected with the virus from outside Thailand”. Thai health officials said on Monday she was recovering. Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market in the city was the centre of the outbreak. It was closed on January 1. There is so far no indication of human-to-human transmission of the virus. - ‘Not unexpected’ - Scientists in Hong Kong’s Department of Health said on Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus from a Wuhan patient  published online by a Chinese expert  indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats. WHO said on Monday it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China. “The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected  and reinforces why WHO calls for ongoing active monitoring and preparedness in other countries ” it said in a statement. Thai authorities have been on high alert  with airport officials checking all passengers coming from Wuhan to the kingdom’s major airports. An official from the Public Health Emergency Operation Center told AFP the infected woman travelling from Wuhan had been intercepted on arrival in Thailand  after airport officials determined she had a fever.  WHO said it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people with the new virus and stressed that China’s decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients. WHO has not recommended any specific measures for travellers or restrictions on trade with China  but stressed on Monday it was taking the situation seriously. “Given developments  WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice ” it said in a statement. During such meetings  experts determine whether the UN health agency should declare an international health emergency -- a designation used only for the gravest epidemics.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-case-of-deadly-sars-like-virus-found-outside-china-says-un/story-g9dAYVu1ZapMC2kB57ijjI.html

The symptoms include with fever  cough and chest congestion and can lead to lung collapse and multi-organ failure in severe cases.,India is likely to start surveillance at major airports to track in-bound international passengers  especially those travelling from China  for symptoms of a new strain of pneumonia following an outbreak in the country’s Wuhan city.  On Saturday  China reported the first death from the outbreak. Tentative diagnosis showed 41 people suffering from the new strain of pneumonia  news agency PTI quoted the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission as saying in a statement. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO)  a new type of coronavirus is the cause of the outbreak in China. The symptoms include with fever  cough and chest congestion and can lead to lung collapse and multi-organ failure in severe cases.  The Union health ministry met representatives from the WHO on Wednesday to monitor the situation. “There was a meeting with officials from the WHO on the issue and the final details are being worked out on the kind of measures needed at this point in time ” a health ministry official said on condition of anonymity.  “As a precautionary measure the airport authorities are being briefed currently to step up vigil ” the official said.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). These viruses are also known to cause mild illnesses like the common cold. “Coronaviruses are highly infectious and very prone to mutation. It’s difficult to predict their behavior. Since it is an acute respiratory tract infection  its spread is easy and fast. However  India doesn’t need to panic as of now ” said Dr Ekta Gupta  senior microbiologist at a Delhi government-run hospital.  According to the outbreak protocol  all major international airports are directed to keep track of in-bound passengers suspected to have symptoms of the disease  especially flying in from the region of outbreak. “The details are yet to be finalized but airports are vulnerable because of the huge movement of international passengers on a daily basis  which is why airport authorities are being briefed ” the official said. An official from the Indian Council of Medical Research said  “There are no new cases in China. There is no evidence of human to human transmission. It appears to be a new zoonotic Corona virus.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-plans-surveillance-at-major-airports-following-pneumonia-outbreak-in-china/story-OyesVqHcGmnSu1HsZc4rJK.html
