05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,For Subhashini ‘Sharad Yadav’  protecting father’s turf  legacy uphill task on poll debut,Subhashini has chosen her father’s tested turf of Madhepura to jump into the rough and tumble of politics.   Sharad Yadav  a veteran socialist leader  has represented Madhepura in Parliament four times and has also lost from there many times  including in the last two Lok Sabha elections.,She jumped into the electoral battle to protect her father Sharad Yadav’s political legacy  but the journey to success in Bihariganj assembly seat is an arduous one for Subhashini Raj Rao  who as a Congress candidate is locked in a multi-corner contest in the constituency. A part of the Madhepura Lok Sabha seat  Bihariganj will go to polls in the third and last phase on November 7. Subhashini has chosen her father’s tested turf of Madhepura to jump into the rough and tumble of politics.   Sharad Yadav  a veteran socialist leader  has represented Madhepura in Parliament four times and has also lost from there many times  including in the last two Lok Sabha elections. Though a native of Madhya Pradesh  Yadav chose Madhepura Lok Sabha constituency to fight elections as a mark of respect to B P Mandal  the author of the Mandal Commission report who was born here. The Mandal Commission report  providing 27 per cent reservation in government jobs to Other Backward Classes  was implemented by the V P Singh government at the centre in which Yadav was a senior member. Yadav along with RJD president Lalu Prasad and incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had played an important role in the “Mandal movement” that paved the way for implementation of the jobs quota recommendations in 1990. The 73-year-old Yadav is admitted to a hospital in Delhi for past many days and hence his daughter has taken up the task to carry forward his political legacy. Her election posters in the constituency introduces her as Subhashini ‘Sharad Yadav’. “This has been my father Sharad Yadav’s karmabhoomi and the kind of support and love that you have given him over the past 25-30 years  I too can feel the same here today ” she told an election at Bihariganj on Wednesday. “I am your candidate  your daughter. I have come here to serve you  to fulfil the dreams of my father ” she told the crowd.    The rally was also addressed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who praised Sharad Yadav for his works  and asked the crowd to vote for her.   “I have not said this in any of my speeches in Bihar elections ” he told the crowd as he appealed them to vote for his “sister”. “I want a guarantee from you that you will make Sharad ji’s daughter win the election. I am not asking for myself  but for you and Sharad Yadav ji  who is your leader. ”  Married to a Congress family of Haryana  Subhashini Raj Rao joined the grand old party on the eve of Bihar polls and was fielded by the party from Bihariganj assembly seat. Though Madhepura seat would have been an ideal launchpad for her  the Congress had to settle for Bihariganj as in the seat-sharing arrangement Madhepura went to the RJD  which has re-nominated its old hand Chandrasekhar.   In her maiden electoral plunge  Subhashini is pitted against two time JD(U) MLA Niranjan Mehta  Lok Janshakti Party candidate Vijay Kumar Singh and Prabhash Kumar of Janadhikar Party (JAP)  which is headed by former Madhepura MP and a prominent Yadav caste politician Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav.    There are a total of 22 candidates on the seat and as per the voter list of 2019  there are 3 00 885 electorate in this constituency.   Dinesh Chandra Yadav of the (JD-U) had won from Madhepura seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election  defeating Sharad Yadav  who had contested from the RJD of Lalu Prasad. Though Yadavs form a bulk of the electors in the constituency  there is a significant presence of other backward castes such as Kushwahas and Extremely Backward Castes. Sitting MLA Niranjan Mehta  a Kushwaha by caste  could lose a section of votes to fellow casteman and LJP nominee Vijay Kumar Singh. Subhasini’s path also does not look very easy. JAP candidate Prabhash Kumar  a Yadav by caste who was once a favourite of Lalu Prasad and had served as the state general secretary of the RJD  left the party after the seat went to the Congress and joined Pappu Yadav-led outfit. As such  Subhasini might not get the full support of the dominant partner party  the RJD.   Sources in the political circles say that local Grand Alliance coalition leaders and workers are not happy over an “outsider” being fielded as a “parachute candidate”  The recent electoral history of the constituency is also not very encouraging for the grand old party. The Congress had not contested the last state polls since the seat had gone to the JD(U)  which was then its ally alongside the RJD  but in 2010 elections  Congress nominee Ranjeet Ranjan  the wife of Pappu Yadav  had stood third. The LJP candidate’s wife Renu Kushwaha had won the Bihariganj seat as a JD(U) candidate in 2010  bagging 79 062 votes while Ranjeet Ranjan had received 27 554. Prabhash Kumar  then in the RJD  had stood second with 29 065 cotes. Subhashini’s main JD(U) rival is relying on Nitish Kumar’s development mantra and also highlighting the “poor” governance and law and order situation in the state under the RJD’s 15-year rule. Nitish Kumar  while campaigning for his party nominee recently  refrained from speaking anything against Sharad Yadav  his former party colleague  and Subhashini. Locals are divided in their appraisals of the government and the opposition.   Tej Narain Yadav  Raj Kumar Yadav  Ram Chandra Sah and Sunil Kumar gave pass mark to the JD(U)  happy with the development work carried out by the Nitish Kuamr government.    However  others highlighted joblessness and what they perceived as corruption under the NDA government.

05/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Firecrackers banned during Diwali  Kali and Chhath Puja in Bengal: Court,While hardly any crackers are used during Durga Puja – the biggest festival in West Bengal - huge amount of crackers are used during the Kali Puja and Diwali every year leading to severe air pollution.,The Calcutta High Court on Thursday banned the use of fireworks during Kali Puja  Diwali and Chhath Puja in November to check the spread of coronavirus in Bengal. Earlier on October 19  the high court had banned the entry of visitors in Durga Puja pandals and mandated putting up of barricades  declaring them as no-entry zones. The result was that West Bengal witnessed a muted Durga Puja this year.  “The high court has extended the Durga Puja restrictions on Kali Puja. Entry of visitors has been banned while capping the number of puja committee members who can enter the pandal at a time ” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee  the lawyer who filed the PIL based on which the orders were passed. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said despite Durga Puja festivities there has been no alarming spike in Covid-19 cases. Earlier  doctors had warned there could be a three to four-fold rise in Covid-19 cases if restrictions were relaxed during the puja.  “I would thank the administration and the puja committees for maintaining peace and following Covid-19 restrictions. Next we have the Kali Puja  Jagadhatri Puja and Chhath Puja. We need to follow restrictions so that there is no further spread. There would be no immersion procession ” said Banerjee.  While hardly any crackers are used during Durga Puja – the biggest festival in West Bengal - huge amount of crackers are used during the Kali Puja and Diwali every year leading to severe air pollution. The Air Quality Index of Kolkata turned poor after Diwali in 2019.  Environment and health experts have warned that chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with severe infections and higher mortality. They feel that lungs compromised due to pollution could lead to complications like pneumonia during Covid-19. “The court has banned the sale and use of fireworks and crackers during Kali Puja  Diwali and Chhath Puja this year. There would be no immersion processions this year ” said Chatterjee.  In its preliminary observations  the bench also said that gathering of people at Rabindra Sarobar and Subhash Sarobar  two of the city’s largest lakes  should be avoided.  “It is a welcome order. This would help to bring down the pollution after Diwali which could have aggravated the Covid-19 situation ” said Subhas Dutta  environment lawyer.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firecrackers-banned-during-diwali-kali-and-chhath-puja-in-bengal-court/story-oyogJRkH35PxlSiVhLQwpM.html
05/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Air pollution increases risk of mortality from Covid-19  NGT informed,Senior advocate Raj Panjawani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh  who have been appointed by the tribunal as amicus curiae in a case related to ban on fire crackers  told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to Covid-19 mortality worldwide.,Air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from Covid-19 as per latest research  the National Green Tribunal was informed on Thursday. Senior advocate Raj Panjawani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh  who have been appointed by the tribunal as amicus curiae in a case related to ban on fire crackers  told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to Covid-19 mortality worldwide. “The latest research on exposure to air pollution and risk of death from Covid-19 infection suggests that ‘air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from Covid- 19’ ” they said.   “The study also states that this finding should provide ‘extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of Covid- 19’. The study estimates that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to Covid-19 mortality worldwide ” they added. The amicus curiae referred to a study by Andrea Pozzer and others -- ‘Regional and global contributions of air pollution to risk of death from Covid-19’ -- and sought suspension of all licences issued by any authority for sale of all kinds of firecrackers. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani  appearing for Indian Fireworks Manufacturers’ Association  opposed the submission of blanket ban on fire crackers and said there is no definite finding and the apex court is already seized of the matter. Advocate Balendu Shekhar  appearing for the Environment Ministry  told the NGT that there is no conclusive finding on relation of air pollution with Covid mortality and they have written to the ministry of health and the ministry of earth sciences seeking their opinion on the issue . The NGT reserved the order and said it will be uploaded on its website by November 9. The amicus referred to ‘State of Global Air 2020’ report released by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease Project  which estimates that India witnessed 980 000 deaths attributable to PM2.5.   The report also states that the long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many of the health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to Covid-19  such as diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and chronic obstructive lung disease  they said. The amicus told the tribunal that green crackers per se generate less pollution  nevertheless they are a major contributor towards pollution as reflected in the CPCB report. Consequently  the only alternative left under the circumstances is to take stern and surgical step to check the proliferation of all kinds of crackers in the interest of general public health and life particularly during this phase of severe Covid-19 pandemic  they said. The amicus sought suspension of all licences issued by any authority for sale of all kinds of firecrackers and if any person is found selling any kind of firecrackers would impliedly be an abettor to environmental pollution and liable for environmental damage of Rs 1 lakh. “In case of individuals found using or allowing the use of any kind of firecracker  the Hon’ble Tribunal may consider imposing a fine of not less than Rs 10 000 ” the amicus suggested. The NGT had on November 2 issued notice to Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and four State governments on whether use of fire crackers be banned from November 7 to 30 in the interest of public health and environment. The tribunal was hearing a plea by Indian Social Responsibility Network  filed through Santosh Gupta  seeking action against pollution by use of fire crackers in NCR during the time air quality is unsatisfactory with potential of severity of Covid-19 pandemic.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-increases-risk-of-mortality-from-covid-19-ngt-informed/story-MGFIcGiCCp2yXSAD7w7oqM.html

While commercial flights between India and China have not resumed  Air India has been operating special rescue flights under the VBM mission to different cities of China. Beijing made similar announcements to bar entry of non-Chinese visitors from Britain  Belgium and the Philippines and demanded travellers from the United States  France and Germany present results of additional health tests as it guards itself against a resurgence in coronavirus cases rising around the world. The new suspension order is a partial reversal of an easing on September 28  when Beijing allowed all foreigners with valid residence permits to enter. China had banned entry of foreigners in response to the epidemic at the end of March.  For India  it means the four VBM flights scheduled every week from November 13th onwards now would have to be rescheduled. Officials in Beijing say more than 1 500 Indians had registered to return to China; Beijing’s new announcement makes their return to China uncertain. The Chinese foreign ministry defended the decision  saying it was a “reasonable and fair” measure to tackle the pandemic.  “China is drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation ” ministry spokesperson  Wang Wenbin  said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday. The India-specific announcement said that neither the Chinese embassy in New Delhi nor consulates in Mumbai and Kolkata would stamp on health certificates furnished by normal passport holders. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic  it’s hereby announced that China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals in India holding valid Chinese visas or residence permits ” the Chinese government said in an announcement on Thursday. “The Chinese Embassy/ Consulates in India will not stamp the Health Declaration Forms for the holders of the above-mentioned categories of visa or residence permits ” the statement added. The Chinese statement clarified that foreigners holding “…Chinese diplomatic  service  courtesy and C visas are not affected.” “Foreigners with emergency or humanitarian needs to visit China can submit visa application to the Chinese Embassy/ Consulates in India. The entry into China with visas issued after November 3rd  2020 is not affected.” “The suspension is a temporary measurement that China has to adopt to deal with the current pandemic. China will make further adjustment and announcement in accordance with the ongoing pandemic situation in a timely manner ” the statement added. As many as 23 Covid-19 positive Indians among them 19 asymptomatic carriers of the infection were on board a VBM flight  which landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi last Friday. The flight had registered the highest number of infected persons on an Indian rescue flight to China so far. The large number of cases on the flight – and the high incidence of the disease in India – prompted the Chinese embassy in New Delhi to change pre-boarding Covid-19 testing rules for Indians coming to China on special flights  November 7 onwards.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-special-flights-from-india-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-oAhoXF3b1cZ4UeV89jf46M.html

05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,peru,No relief for TV anchor Arnab Goswami  high court to hear plea tomorrow,Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami was arrested by Alibag police on Wednesday morning and was remanded in judicial custody till November 18 by a chief judicial magistrate at Alibag,A division bench of the Bombay High Court on Thursday refused a plea by Arnab Goswami  editor-in-chief of Republic TV  to be released immediately and posted his petition challenging his arrest by Alibag police in a 2018 abetment to suicide case for further hearing on Friday afternoon.  Goswami was arrested by Alibag police on Wednesday morning and was remanded in judicial custody till November 18 by a chief judicial magistrate at Alibag. The TV anchor  who had filed for a bail before the magistrate  withdrew his bail plea on Thursday and had moved the high court seeking immediate release  contending his arrest and detention was completely illegal. His counsel  senior advocate Aabad Ponda  submitted that the case was closed by police in 2018 itself by filing an A-summary report (true but undetected) and it was not open to the police to reopen the case and start reinvestigation without a court order. “It (magisterial order accepting the summary report and closing the case) was a nail in the coffin ” Ponda said. Insisting that the case could not have been resurrected without a court order - order issued by the concerned magistrate or some higher court. The senior advocate also pointed out the Supreme Court rulings in support of his contention and submitted that the arrest of Goswami in “the dead case” was completely illegal. Ponda urged the court to release the Republic editor immediately  as according to him  detention of the journalist was not legally permissible at all. He said the high court had enough plenary powers and must come to the rescue of a citizen treated unfairly by the state. “This is a classic illustration of misuse of power by police and such arrest and detention cannot be tolerated even for a second ” he said  urging the court to release Goswami immediately on interim bail. But the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik refused to issue an order for immediate release stating that it “can’t pass an order without hearing the complainant and state”. The bench held this after senior advocate Amit Desai  representing the state government  requested for time to peruse the case papers. The bench  however  expressed inability to pass any interim order without granting the opportunity of hearing to the Maharashtra government  and the complainant  and posted the petition for further hearing on Friday on Desai’s request. The bench also issued notices to the state and also to the complainant Adnya Naik  daughter of Anvay Naik who had died by suicide in 2018. The bench felt it necessary to add the complainant as a party respondent to the petition  especially because she was not heard when the A-summary report was accepted and the case was closed by the judicial magistrate concerned. The bench said it did not want to make the same mistake in this proceeding and directed Goswami to add her as a party to the petition  so that she can put forth her side on Friday. The bench also posted for hearing a plea filed by Adnya Naik for the case to be reinvestigated.  Interior designer  Anvay Naik died by suicide in Alibaug  Raigad. He was 53. His mother Kumud Naik too was also found dead at their home. In his suicide note  Naik alleged he was being forced to take this step as he was not paid dues collectively amounting to Rs 5.40 crore by Goswami and two others. Naik was the managing director of Concorde Designs Private Limited  which rendered services for Republic TV. Along with Republic channel  Naik had dues with two other companies namely Smartworks and IcastX/Skimedia. After Naik’s suicide  his wife Akshata had lodged a complaint with Alibaug police against Arnab Goswami  Feroz Shaikh and Nitish Sarda for allegedly abetting their suicide. Shaikh is connected to IcastX/Skimedia while Sarda is connected to Smart Works. Naik had alleged that he owes Rs 83 lakh to Goswami  Rs 55 lakhs to Sarda and Rs 4 crore to Shaikh.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-relief-for-tv-anchor-arnab-goswami-high-court-to-hear-plea-tomorrow/story-WxYCFM7I189cSSl84nqZhN.html

Addressing an election rally here on the last of the campaign  he attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi  alleging that he never realises when he starts opposing India’s national interest in his quest for criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Flaying the Mahagathbandhan  he said the RJD and the Congress have joined hands with the CPI(ML)  whose very thought is “destructive”. He also alleged that the RJD spread anarchy in the state during its 15-year rule and it should apologise to the people of Bihar. “This is not an election just about voting for a candidate. It’s about the future of Bihar ” he said. “On one side  there are those who work for development and on the other  there are those who left no stone unturned in taking Bihar towards destruction ” he added  Nadda said Modi has “given such a mantra of development” that even the Mahagathbandhan is “forced” to talk about development. “Otherwise these are the people who would take Bihar toward destruction ” he alleged. He also mocked RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s promise of giving 10 lakh government jobs  saying he should first talk about the “25 lakh” people who were forced to migrate out of Bihar in the regime of his father -- Lalu Prasad. Nadda also talked about the local agricultural produces and the famous Mithila paintings. “Eighty per cent of the country’s makhana comes from Bihar and out of that  90 per cent from just six districts of Mithilanchal. We will set a factory here and brand it. Mithila will not ask for jobs after that  it will give jobs ” he said. He also reiterated that the Modi government at the Centre has given more money to Bihar than the Rs 1.25 lakh crore he had promised during the 2015 polls. He said that under the Ujala scheme  37 crore LED bulbs were distributed across the country  and out of that 1 crore 95 lakh were distributed in Bihar itself. “Modi-ji has taken Bihar from the lantern era to LED era ” he said.

The Covid-19 pandemic  which Shringla described as the “most catastrophic event after World War 2”  has “uncovered the vulnerabilities of nations” and led to the emergence of plurilateral platforms to cope with new challenges  he said while delivering a lecture at an online event marking the diamond jubilee of the National Defence College.  Speaking on the theme “Leveraging strategic autonomy in a turbulent world”  he said: “While there is a strong intent to cooperate  the need to retain strategic autonomy is even greater.”  Without naming China  whose aggressive actions have resulted in efforts for coordinated responses by countries in the Indo-Pacific region  Shringla referred to India’s upcoming two-year stint in the UN Security Council and said: “We remain committed to upholding a rules-based international order underpinned by the rule of law  transparency  freedom of navigation in the international seas  respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes.”  India’s objective will be advancing the security and economic interests of all countries against the backdrop of the Security Council’s dynamics having changed in the past decade. “As a rule-abiding democracy and positive contributor to the security of global commons  India aims to bring innovation and inclusive solutions to foster development. Reformed multilaterism is going to be a top priority for us ” he said.  In this context  Shringla pointed to India’s role in supporting a fair and inclusive WTO  World Bank and IMF and its role in digital taxation negotiations. He also said India had emerged as a net security provider in its extended neighbourhood by being at the forefront of humanitarian assistance operations and cooperating with Indo-Pacific countries on maritime security  anti-piracy and marine pollution.  However  Shringla cautioned that the global economic fallout of the pandemic will remain a challenge in the times to come  and require a carefully deliberate approach. “The breakdown of global supply chains has perhaps for the first time led us to think and explore alternative possibilities. India’s view has been to look at this challenge  not as a constraint  but as an opportunity for our economy as well as for rebalancing the international system ” he said.  “While keeping our strategic autonomy  we recognise the value of profitable economic convergence and the need to diversify as a need of the hour ” he said  noting that this was reflected in India’s virtual summits with Australia  the European Union (EU)  Denmark  and Sri Lanka  and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue consultations.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-committed-to-uphold-rules-based-international-order-foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla/story-edKstgDAZkxJyTdN30icGO.html

A district BJP leader who attended the closed-door meeting said Shah asked the district and state leaders to strengthen the organization right down to the polling booth level to ensure that the BJP wins more than 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. Shah reportedly told the leaders that they should be determined to achieve this target instead of making just an effort.  The minister surprised everyone by not wearing a mask although other BJP leaders around him followed the safety protocol.  Halfway through the meeting  Shah took a break and went to Chaturdihi village with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh  national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya  national secretary Arvind Menon  national vice-president Mukul Roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda  a member of the local tribal community. Shah sat on the floor with others and had rice  chapati  dal and curry cooked in earthenware. He had all the items but stayed away from rosogolla  the traditional Bengali sweet  saying he had stopped taking sweet dishes.  Significantly  former national secretary Rahul Sinha  who distanced himself from the party for more than two weeks after being dropped from the national committee  also attended the organisational meeting.  About three hours before he had lunch at the tribal village  Shah said that the death knell of the Mamata Banerjee government has been sounded and the BJP will come to power with a two-third majority in the coming elections.  “The manner in which the Mamata Banerjee government has neglected the poor  the farmers  the backward classes and the tribal people and have oppressed people  especially BJP workers  I can clearly see that its death knell has been sounded. In the coming days  the BJP will come to power with two-third majority and form the government ” Shah told the media shortly after garlanding the statue of Birsa Munda  the leader of the freedom movement carried out by tribal people in the region against the British Raj.  “I appeal to the people to overthrow this government and give the BJP the opportunity to build sonar Bangla (a golden Bengal) ” said Shah.  Chief minister Mamata Banerjee reacted to this while addressing an administrative meeting at the state secretariat in Kolkata around the same time when Shah was having lunch more than 200 km away.  “We will not tolerate the politics of threat. People should stay within their limits. People of Bengal will not accept outsiders ” Banerjee said without naming Shah.  Without naming the BJP  she said  “A party is spreading the pandemic while common people are following Covid-19 health restrictions.”  Shah arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night. He flew to Bankura in a chopper a little before noon on Thursday.  “You (Mamata Banerjee) are wrong if you think that you can stop the BJP by stopping Central schemes in West Bengal. If you let people enjoy the benefits of these schemes they may at least spare some thoughts for you ” said Shah after the short garlanding ceremony of the Birsa Munda statue organised by the BJP.  The BJP showed its best performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bankura district. It won two seats and stayed ahead of the TMC in almost all the assembly segments.  “Amit Shah’s ambition of winning 200 assembly seats will remain a dream.

05/11/2020,government;coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Centre set for record paddy buying this year to blunt farmers’ agitation,The ministry’s official projections show the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes  up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20  an increase of 18%,The Union government is on course to buy a record quantity of paddy this year with a sharply higher share of Punjab to blunt a politically-challenging farmers’ agitation against a set of laws enacted to liberalise the farm sector  projections of the food ministry show. Paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of cultivators in states such as Punjab. The ministry’s official projections show the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes  up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20  an increase of 18%. To be sure  production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne  slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20  according to an official forecast. Also read | ‘Officers will visit villages to buy entire paddy’: KCR messages farmers The ministry has expanded its procurement operations  which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at assured prices  for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers  against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres  which now stand at 39 122  up from 30 709 last year  official figures show. According to the ministry’s data  the government has bought  till November 4  over 22.4 million tonne of paddy  which is already 20.18% higher than the 18.6 million tonne procured during the corresponding period last year. Of the total purchases  Punjab’s share so far has been the highest at 15.8 million tonne  which is 70.52% of the total quantity procured. Farmers in Punjab are protesting against the reforms that allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce  permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. A crucial change is that traders  agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market  rather than only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate. The government enacted three laws on September 24 to usher in these changes. The laws have angered farmers  particularly in Punjab  who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system  which offers growers an assured price  leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said  on several occasions  that the three laws have no bearing on the current system of procurement at assured prices  which will continue. To placate farmers  the government’s food buying agencies have launched large buying operations in Punjab  Haryana  Uttar Pradesh  Uttarakhand  Tamil Nadu  Chandigarh  Jammu & Kashmir  Kerala  Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Year-on-year comparisons show higher purchases. For instance  the government  till November 1  purchased 12.9 million tonne paddy in Punjab  which is 37% higher than the quantity procured during the corresponding period last year (9.4 million tonne). In Uttar Pradesh  paddy procurement till November 1  was higher by 413% at 390 920 tonne  against 76 254 tonne during the same period last year.  The food ministry has also started procuring rice for the first time from Uttarakhand and so far  405 174 tonne have been purchased. Till November 4  the paddy purchases have benefited nearly 1.8 million farmers  who have been paid MSP of Rs42 422.49 crore since procurement of crops began on September 27. “The higher procurement will likely overshoot the government’s storage capacity and make managing stocks difficult unless the government offloads more as food aid to the poor ” said analyst Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade  a commodities trading firm. From April to November 2020  the government has made an additional offering of free food under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY)  launched due to Covid-19. This has freed up storage capacities of bulging state-held granaries and made way for higher paddy procurement.  The total allocation under the PMGKY is 32.1 million tonne. This included 21.4 million tonne of rice and 10.6 million tonne of wheat. As on September 1  total federally held food stocks stood at 77.3 million tonne  up from 71.2 million tonnes on the same date last year. The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety paddy at Rs1 868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at Rs1 888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country for the 2020-21 kharif season.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-for-record-paddy-buying-this-year-to-blunt-farmers-agitation/story-AC6eOaxvicSwvRoLddp4AL.html

Bharat Biotech  a private company that is developing COVAXIN with the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)  had earlier hoped to launch it only in the second quarter of next year. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “The vaccine has shown good efficacy ” senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant  who is also a member of its Covid-19 task-force  said at the research body’s New Delhi headquarters on Thursday. “It is expected that by the beginning of next year  February or March  something would be available.” Bharat Biotech could not immediately be contacted. A launch in February would make COVAXIN the first India-made vaccine to be rolled out. India’s cases of coronavirus infections rose by 50 201 cases on Thursday to 8.36 million  second only to the United States. Deaths rose by 704  with the total now at 124 315. The daily rise in infections and deaths has slowed since a peak in mid-September. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage  Kant  who is the head of ICMR’s research management  policy  planning and coordination cell  said it was up to the health ministry to decide if COVAXIN shots can be given to people even before the third-stage trials are over. “It has shown safety and efficacy in the phase 1 and 2 trials and in the animal studies - so it is safe but you can’t be 100% sure unless the phase 3 trials are over ” Kant said. “There may be some risk  if you are ready to take the risk  you can take the vaccine. If necessary  the government can think of giving the vaccine in an emergency situation.” Health minister Harsh Vardhan said in September the government was considering granting an emergency authorisation for a Covid-19 vaccine  particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces. Several leading vaccine candidates are already in final-stage testing. An experimental vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca is among the most advanced ones  and Britain expects to roll it out in late December or early 2021. AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world  including with the Serum Institute of India.

In the coming days the BJP will come to power with two-third majority and form the government ” Shah told the media shortly after garlanding the statue of Birsa Munda  the leader of the Independence movement carried out by tribal people in the region against the British Raj.  “I appeal to the people to overthrow this government and give the BJP the opportunity to build sonar Bangla (a golden Bengal) ” said Shah.  Shah surprised everyone by not wearing a mask although other BJP leaders around him followed the safety protocol.  Assembly elections will be held in West Bengal in about six months.  Shah arrived at Kolkata on Wednesday night. He flew to Bankura in a chopper a little before noon on Thursday. He began his programme by garlanding the statue of Birsa Munda who is worshipped by tribal people.  After the short garlanding ceremony  Shah went to Bankura town to address BJP leaders from 13 districts in an internal meeting to outline the strategy of the coming polls.  “I started my two-day journey by garlanding the statue of Bhagwan (God) Birsa Munda. Since my arrival last night I have witnessed public outrage against the Mamata Banerjee government and people’s increasing faith in the Narendra Modi government. They know that only the social welfare projects started by the Modi government can change their lives ” said Shah.  “The tribal people of Bengal are not getting the housing schemes started by the Centre. The poor are not getting healthcare facilities. The farmers are not getting the annual aid of Rs 6 000 ” said Shah.  “You (Mamata Banerjee) are wrong if you think that you can stop the BJP by stopping Central schemes in West Bengal. If you let people enjoy the benefits of these schemes they may at least spare some thoughts for you ” said Shah.  The Union home minister was also scheduled to have lunch with a tribal family. The BJP showed its best performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bankura district. It won two seats and stayed ahead of the TMC in almost all the assembly segments.  “Amit Shah is day dreaming ” TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said in Kolkata  reacting to Shah’s statement on the BJP coming to power. “If BJP is capable of building a golden Bengal why doesn’t it build a golden Uttar Pradesh? The BJP is a party of rich people. Having lunch at the home of a tribal family is just a drama. People of Bengal will never bring the BJP to power ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-knell-of-mamata-banerjee-govt-has-been-sounded-amit-shah-in-bengal/story-CVJMURgHBOeMCDfpYoBTqN.html

There were no casualties nor were there any injuries to any workers. According to unconfirmed reports  some employees said there was a huge loss to the machinery in the power plant running into a few crore rupees.  According to D Durgaprasad  assistant general manager and an official spokesman of the VSP  fire was reported in the power plant-2 of the steel plant at around 4.45 am  apparently due to leakage of oil from the lubrication system.  “Fire services from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) were called and fire was brought under control immediately. The damage is being assessed to bring back the PP-2 at the earliest ” he said.  The spokesman said there were no injuries to any person in the mishap and steel plant’s production was also not affected.  There are two captive thermal power plants near the main entrance of the steel plant – one generating 243 MW and another 120 MW. “The fire mishap occurred in the 120 MW power plant due to leakage of lubricant in the oil pump  resulting in burning of the entire power generating turbine ” an official of the VSP said on condition of anonymity.  While there is no immediate threat to the steel plant due to the functioning of the power plant-1  the authorities have to purchase power from outside till the burnt power plant is restored in order to see that the production in the steel plant is not affected.  “The cables connecting the affected power plant with the main grid have been segregated  so that the power supply from the other plant continues uninterruptedly ” the official said. He also said that an internal probe has started to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.

The BJP had proposed to embark on the yatra from November 6 to December 6 across Tamil Nadu (starting from Thirutani and concluding in Thiruchendur) to celebrate Tamil deity Lord Murugan in its attempt to consolidate the Hindu vote bank.  The Madras HC disposed of two public interest litigations filed on the yatra with liberty to the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit to challenge the government’s rejection. Advocate General Vijay Narayan citied a government order that prohibits religious  political and social gatherings until November 15.  K S Narendran  BJP’s general secretary who planned the route map for the yatra had earlier told HT that the yatra would be a “turning point for BJP in Tamil Nadu”. Opposition parties had demanded that the yatra be banned because  it could lead to religious tensions in the state. Ravikumar  an MP from the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK)  a DMK ally  tweeted that it was a victory for secularism following the order. The VCK had written to the Tamil Nadu police to deny permission for the yatra  as it could create communal unrest. They also questioned the timing of the yatra  which is slated to end on December 6 – the 28th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.  Despite being an ally of the BJP  the All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government denied permission to the BJP for its yatra. The AIADMK had earlier criticised the BJP for using the ruling party’s founder MG Ramachandran’s photograph in its promotional campaign for the yatra.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-govt-shows-covid-19-protocol-to-bjp-denies-permission-for-yatra/story-IK0BMizWcmD4vBuj1GO0pO.html

Naravane reached Kathmandu on Wednesday on a three-day visit that is expected to smoothen bilateral ties with Nepal after a bitter border row.  “Additional ventilators were also gifted to assist Nepali Army in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic. This follows an earlier army-to-army provision of ventilators in July this year ” the statement said. On Thursday  Naravane laid a wreath and paid homage at Bir Smarak (Martyr’s Memorial) at the Army Pavilion in Tundikhel  Kathmandu. He was later accorded a ceremonial Guard of Honour at the Nepali Army Headquarters where he held talks with his counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa.  Both sides discussed army-to-army relations and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation  the statement said.  Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari will also confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army on Naravane at an investiture ceremony.  The army chief’s visit comes months after bilateral ties were hit in May after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region  which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani  Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura  all controlled by India  as part of Nepalese territory  exacerbating the row. Naravane’s visit is expected to lay the ground work for much anticipated talks between the two sides on the border issue.  His Nepal tour comes days after Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel made a low-key visit to Kathmandu during which he met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.  The army chief is expected to interact with Indian Army pensioners in Nepal during the visit --- there are 136 000 pensioners in that country and form part of the strong links between the two sides. This is Naravane’s second visit with diplomatic overtones  after last month’s tour of Myanmar  where he accompanied foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and was part of crucial talks on security cooperation and developmental issues.  Sameer Patil  fellow for international security studies at Gateway House  said it is crucial for India to maintain momentum in its ties with Nepal at a time when Beijing is trying to expand its influence in Kathmandu amid the India-China border standoff.  “There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work by both armies to mend the relationship and this is a good sign. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said we can’t choose our neighbours and Nepal is a neighbour we have to work with. The Chinese are pushing for greater proximity with Nepal  and one of the ways of doing that is sowing distrust between India and Nepal ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-general-naravane-presents-medical-gear-to-nepali-army/story-cUGJf7kBomGlX0lE8WBhbJ.html

05/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;pakistan,India to Pakistan: Reverse decision on handing over Kartarpur gurdwara to non-Sikh body,According to a notification issued on November 3  Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry handed over the management of Durbar Sahib gurdwara to a “project management unit”,India on Thursday asked Pakistan to reverse its “arbitrary decision” to hand over the management of Durbar Sahib gurdwara  built at the site in Kartarpur where Guru Nanak spent the last years of his life  to a body without any Sikh representatives.  According to a notification issued on November 3  Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry handed over the management of Durbar Sahib gurdwara to a “project management unit” under the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB)  a government department that oversees the shrines of the country’s minorities. The gurdwara was earlier under the management of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC).  This is believed to be the first time that PSGPC has been shut out of the management of a gurdwara in Pakistan. There are no Sikhs among the officials and staff appointed by the ETPB for the Darbar Sahib gurdwara  people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.  Also read | Decision to re-open Kartarpur Corridor will be as per Covid-19 protocol: MEA The external affairs ministry said in a statement that Pakistan had transferred the management and maintenance of the gurdwara at Kartarpur from the PSGPC  “a body run by the minority Sikh community  to the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board  a non-Sikh body”.  “Pakistan is called upon to reverse its arbitrary decision to deprive the Sikh minority community its right to manage affairs of the Holy Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib ” the statement said.  “This unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor as also the religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large ” it added.  The ministry said it had received representations from the Sikh community “expressing grave concern at this decision by Pakistan targeting the rights of the minority Sikh community”. It added: “Such actions only expose the reality of the Pakistani government and its leadership’s tall claims of preserving and protecting the rights and welfare of the religious minority communities.”  In November last year  India and Pakistan opened a 4.7-km cross-border corridor connecting Dera Baba Nanak in India’s Gurdaspur district with Durbar Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan’s Kartarpur to allow Indian pilgrims to visit the shrine without visas.  India is yet to decide on reopening its part of the Kartarpur Corridor  which was shut in March as part of Covid-19-related travel restrictions  following Pakistan’s recent decision to open its side.  New Delhi has called on Islamabad to construct required infrastructure  including a bridge at Budhi Ravi channel  for the safe movement of pilgrims over a stretch that gets waterlogged during the rainy season.  The gurdwara stands on the site where Guru Nanak  the founder of the Sikh religion  spent the last years of his life.  India went ahead with the opening of the corridor to respect the sentiments of the Sikh community despite strong misgivings about several steps taken by the Pakistani side  including the imposition of a service fee of $20 on every pilgrim  and security concerns.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-pakistan-to-reverse-decision-on-handing-over-kartarpur-gurdwara-to-non-sikh-body/story-kKzt2mJ0AMKpalTK9cnnbJ.html

His comments come on the eve of the eight round of military talks between the two countries to reduce friction in the sensitive eastern Ladakh theatre.  Singh said India is a peace-loving country but has been facing challenges on its borders.

We attach importance to the peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue. We respect various agreements and protocols that India has entered into for peace and tranquility on our borders ” Singh said  during a speech to mark the diamond jubilee of the National Defence College.  The next round of corps-commander-level talks will be held along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chushul sector on Friday. Indian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12 in an attempt to defuse border tensions.  The Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre. The eight round of talks will be led for the first time by the new commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps  Lieutenant General PGK Menon.  Both armies are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are likely to hold forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months.  The latest round of military talks comes at a time when China is closely tracking the Malabar exercise  kicked off by the navies of India  United States  Japan and Australia in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday amid Chinese sabre-rattling in the Indo-Pacific region.  The 24th edition of the Malabar exercise is being held in two phases -- the first phase in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and the second phase in the Arabian Sea in mid-November.  China has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India  the US  Australia and Japan  and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.  On Pakistan  the defence minister said the neighbour remains adamant in the use of terrorism as state policy. “However  we have achieved substantial success in working with progressive and like-minded countries to not only expose Pakistan’s regressive policies but also make it increasingly difficult to continue with its previous business as usual approach ” Singh said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-determined-to-protect-its-sovereignty-amid-aggression-says-rajnath/story-YIzY0qTaW1llmUY1vp9wyL.html

05/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india;italy,Kanpur doctors studying Italian model to check possible second wave of Covid-19,As many as 740 people have died in Kanpur due to Covid-19 and related complications in the last four months.,Amid the fear of a second wave of Covid-infection in the winter  experts at the Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College in Kanpur are studying the Italian model and speaking to experts in that country to prepare better for any eventuality on the coronavirus front. The focus is on containing the mortality rate that Italy largely checked when the second wave hit Europe. As many as 740 people have died in Kanpur due to Covid-19 and related complications in the last four months. Dr Saurabh Agarwal  associate professor in the medicine department  said certain changes were being made in managing the crisis and treatment protocol. “We have consulted experts in Italy and studied how they are handling the second wave ” he said. Dr Aggarwal also said that doctors at the facility would continue to follow ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines but certain changes would be made with regard to taking care of patients. Based on the Italian model  a team consisting of a physician  pulmonary expert  neurologist and a cardiologist would keep monitoring the patients remotely through Zoom and change the treatment plan accordingly. “Use of technology will help in augmenting the watch over the patients. Physical rounds of wards can be (taken) once or more than once. But with technology  we can take Zoom rounds several times in a day ” he said. “We are following ICMR guidelines religiously  yet we will be incorporating our efforts in the treatment plan ” he said.  In Kanpur  the maximum number of deaths  569  has taken place at the government-run Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital which is meant for critical cases.  Hence  keeping the mortality rate under control during the possible second wave is a priority. “The Zoom rounds have started from October 30 in the wards. The team of experts gathers the details of patients from doctors in the wards. They do micro level discussion among themselves and plan the treatment ” he said. Apart from this  some changes in treatment have helped in saving the lives of patients. The experiments done with anti-viral dosage and steroids have helped patients with co-morbidities.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-doctors-studying-italian-model-to-check-possible-second-wave-of-covid-19/story-e3NRGgIOCkqtRV6mPvYq3L.html

05/11/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,Delhi wakes up to severe air pollution  AQI at 452,Such high AQI can impact healthy people and seriously affect those with existing health conditions  according to the Central Pollution Control Board,Delhi’s air quality has rapidly worsened to “severe” on the air quality index (AQI) on Thursday morning  as residents woke up to an AQI of 452. AQI between 401 and 500 is considered to be severe  which can impact healthy people and seriously affect those with existing health conditions  according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI was in the “very poor” – between 301 and 400 -- category till Wednesday afternoon  but worsened rapidly to “severe” due to a shift in meteorological conditions.  Wind speed gradually reduced and became calm  which left no room for dispersal of pollutants at night. Also read | Change in wind pattern covers Delhi in a thick blanket of smoke India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said a layer of smoke and pollution had settled closer to the surface on Wednesday  which blocked sunlight and reduced visibility through the day. The weather condition led to a dip in the maximum temperature to 28 degrees Celsius (C) -- 2 degrees C below normal – on Wednesday. “Smog-like conditions have developed because of air pollution  low wind speed and subsidence of cold air over this region. Air is subsiding over the northern plains  particularly Delhi-national capital region (NCR). As a result  dispersal of pollutants is not possible ” said Vijay Soni  scientist  air quality division  IMD. The Air Quality Early Warning System under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) had said air quality has started worsening significantly after 10:00 am on Wednesday due to strong subsidence and accumulation of pollutants.  The AQI may reach the higher end of the very poor to severe category before improvement starts on Thursday  it has forecast. “We are expecting wind speed to be low for the next couple of days. I don’t see these conditions improving immediately ” said Kuldeep Shrivastava  head  regional weather forecasting centre. The minimum temperature on Thursday increased to 12.1 degrees C  as compared to 10.6 degrees C on the previous day. “There is shallow fog on Thursday. The minimum temperature has increased because of the layer of pollution  which doesn’t allow the surface heat to radiate back at night ” Shrivastava added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-severe-air-pollution-aqi-at-452/story-GxcGL4woxwqd0H6LQgYVdL.html
05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,SIT report points to nexus between slain gangster Vikas Dubey and cops,Officials said the SIT findings further confirmed that some police personnel had leaked information of the police department to Vikas Dubey  who was eventually gunned down by UP Special Task Force on July 10.,The report of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on the ambush of policemen in Kanpur case pointed to a nexus between slain gangster Vikas Dubey and some police personnel as well as other government servants  Uttar Pradesh home department officials familiar with the development said. The report was submitted to the state government on Wednesday  they said. Eight police personnel were killed in the ambush during a raid on Dubey’s house at Bikru village in Kanpur district on July 3. The officials said the SIT findings further confirmed that some police personnel had leaked information of the police department to Vikas Dubey  who was eventually gunned down by UP Special Task Force (STF) on July 10 when he allegedly tried to escape from custody after a road accident. The three-member SIT was headed by senior IAS officer Sanjay Bhoosreddy and its two other members were additional director general of police Hari Ram Sharma and deputy inspector general of police J Ravinder Goud. The state government formed the SIT on July 11 to probe the ambush case and initially gave it three weeks to wrap up the investigation. The deadline was extended later. A senior official privy to the investigation said SIT submitted its findings related to nine aspects of the ambush case. He said the report mainly contained findings about the background of the incident  negligence in criminal cases against Dubey and his gang members in the past few years. He said it also included the findings related to the alleged links of policemen as well as other government servants with Dubey  besides intelligence failure about the firepower possessed by his gang. “The other aspects included police failure in getting Dubey and his men convicted in court  negligence of police personnel posted at Kanpur’s Chaubeypur police station and supervisory police officers in relation to complaints against Dubey and his gang members ” he said. “The SIT analysed Dubey’s cell phone records of the last 12 months to find out which policemen were in regular touch with him  and it has recommended action against them ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-report-points-to-nexus-between-slain-gangster-vikas-dubey-and-cops/story-ePfq7lyEbBNOXzXUgazO4I.html
05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Supreme Court refuses to restrain 12 Madhya Pradesh rebel Congress MLAs from ministership,Twenty-two Congress MLAs who switched sides to join the BJP led to the downfall of the Kamal Nath government in the state in March.,A Madhya Pradesh Congress legislator’s plea in the Supreme Court to restrain 12 defected Congress lawmakers to continue as ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government was rendered infructuous on Wednesday  after the recent by-elections to 28 seats allowed these MLAs to contest afresh on BJP ticket. A three-judge bench led by CJI SA Bobde dismissed the petition filed by Vinay Saxena  an MLA of the Indian National Congress (INC) from Jabalpur (North) constituency. The petition was filed in March  at a time when the disqualification petitions against 22 rebel Congress MLAs (including the 12 legislators in question) was pending action with the Speaker of the Madhya Pradesh assembly. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal  who appeared for Saxena  informed the court that it was unfortunate that despite the petition being filed in March  delay in hearing rendered it infructuous. “Those who ought to have been disqualified  no action has been taken even as matters are languishing in courts against their disqualification ” Sibal said. This was not the lone case  he added  pointing to similar pleas languishing in the apex court against defected legislators in Goa  Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Twenty-two Congress MLAs who switched sides to join the BJP led to the downfall of the Kamal Nath government in the state in March.  “Time is sought by both sides. Even you ask for adjournment ” CJI Bobde remarked  pointing to Sibal.

05/11/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,,Supreme Court lays down maintenance rules,A bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and R Subhash Reddy said directions are required to be passed to overcome the issue of overlapping jurisdiction and avoid conflicting orders.,The Supreme Court in a judgment on Wednesday  ruled that wives and minor children will now be able to receive maintenance from the date of filing an application for maintenance  ensuring  uniformity of grant of maintenance available under various legislations as well as filling a lacunae that existed in the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) as well as Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA) which did not specify when maintenance order would be enforceable. A bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and R Subhash Reddy said directions are required to be passed to overcome the issue of overlapping jurisdiction and avoid conflicting orders.  The need for uniformity in this aspect was noted by the SC to help serve the interests of women fighting protracted legal battles for divorce  custody and maintenance with no financial means to secure their litigation expenses. To ensure such a situation does not play to the disadvantage of women  the  bench said  “Financial constraints of a dependant spouse hampers their capacity to be effectively represented before the Court. In order to prevent a dependant from being reduced to destitution  it is necessary that maintenance is awarded from the date on which the application for maintenance is filed before the concerned Court.” The Court directed a copy of its judgment to be communicated to all High Courts and District Courts.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-lays-down-maintenance-rules/story-I8GaXEYYzFv5SOHXFSPcIN.html

Under the deal signed in January 2005  Antrix had agreed to build  launch and operate two satellites and to provide 70 MHz of S-band spectrum to Devas by which the private company would offer hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication services throughout India. Antrix terminated the deal in February 2011. The dispute between Antrix and Devas has been pending consideration before the SC since 2018. Attorney general KK Venugopal  appearing for Antrix Corporation  and solicitor general Tushar Mehta  for the Centre  moved separate applications in the top court to keep the award in abeyance.  Venugopal said: “This stay is still in operation and it ties my hands. Till the matter is settled between the parties on whether the proceeding under Section 34 of Arbitration Act will lie in Delhi or Bengaluru  Devas has invoked the jurisdiction of the US court to enforce the award. We have to obtain a stay against the said award.”   A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said:  “It is highly iniquitous to execute the award without objections under Section 34 to the award are dealt with.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dvas-antrix-case-supreme-court-stay-on-us-court-order-of-1-2-billion-payoff/story-AwWmazryAt6NDwkGFQ0ErN.html

Having said that there is still some time before the total impact could be seen related to disease transmission during Navratri  Puja and Dussehra. The government is closely watching the situation as it takes 10 to 14 days for the cases to get reported ” said Paul. The festive season has not ended yet and more festivals such as Diwali  Christmas etc. are coming up; which is why it is important not to drop our guard and adhere more strictly to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour ” he added. Experts say mask provides the ultimate protection  and wearing a mask must be strictly adhered to. “Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is most cost-effective. The cost of a mask is miniscule; same goes for washing hands and maintaining physical distance  which is also the most cost-effective measure ” said Dr Balram Bhargava  director general  ICMR.  Doctors treating Covid-19 patients also echoed similar views. “These three— winters  pollution and ongoing festivities  together is a killer combination for the spread of Covid-19.

05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Kerala govt withdraws general consent to CBI,The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Kerala on Wednesday revoked the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases on the state’s territory  following the example of five other non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-governed states.,The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Kerala on Wednesday revoked the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases on the state’s territory  following the example of five other non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-governed states. The move means the CBI will now require permission of the Kerala government to conduct any future investigation in the state. Last month  the Maharashtra government withdrew general consent to the agency.  After consent given under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act is withdrawn  the CBI can’t file fresh first information reports (FIRs) related to entities in the states  but it will not affect ongoing investigations  according to legal experts. Andhra Pradesh  West Bengal  Chattisgarh and Rajasthan have also red-flagged the CBI  which the parties that rule these states allege is being used by the BJP-led government at the Centre to hound their administrations.  In Kerala  the move comes in the backdrop of central agencies making visits to the state in connection with a gold smuggling case and a drug haul in Bengaluru. But the immediate trigger was the way the central agency registered a case of alleged financial irregularities in the state’s project to build free houses for the homeless  called Life Mission  without informing the Kerala government.   “We will not allow a free run of central agencies. Many states have already complained that the CBI was interfering in issues where it has no jurisdiction. It also started questioning policy decisions of the government. We will not allow this to happen ” said state law minister AK Balan.  Last month  the government was forced to rush to the high court to quash a CBI probe of Life Mission and secured a two-month stay.  The Congress and BJP criticised the state’s decision  saying the government was scared and wanted to save people who may have received kickbacks in the Life Mission project.  CBI officials refused to comment on the matter.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-withdraws-general-consent-to-cbi/story-wmHEoPIC87dBjUMqLjZ1sM.html
05/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,germany;india;new zealand,Covid-19: What you need to know today,Photographs of crowded election rallies in Bihar (the last stage of polling is on Saturday) have caused concern in some quarters about a spike in coronavirus disease cases in the state.,Photographs of crowded election rallies in Bihar (the last stage of polling is on Saturday) have caused concern in some quarters about a spike in coronavirus disease cases in the state. Such concern is misplaced. According to the HT dashboard  Bihar had a mere 7 001 active cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday night. On Tuesday  the state registered just 846 cases from the 143 642 tests it carried out. That translates to a positivity rate of 0.6%. The cumulative positivity rate of the state is 1.9% (it carried out 11.33 million tests till Tuesday evening and registered 218 964 cases). And it has a case fatality rate of 0.5%. These are numbers of which Germany  a country widely acknowledged with managing the pandemic well — largely on the strength of aggressive testing and its legacy investments in hospital infrastructure — would be proud (Bihar’s numbers are a lot better than Germany’s  you see). Bihar’s population  at 125 million  is around 50% higher than Germany’s 83 million. It is also 25 times New Zealand’s population. That island country’s cumulative positivity rate is 0.17%. I’ve written previously about the mystery of Uttar Pradesh’s numbers  and how this is similar to the mystery of Africa’s (which has also seen disproportionately few cases and fewer deaths than most parts of the world). It’s a mystery that’s led to some interesting hypotheses  such as this: “The mortality due to Covid-19 in different nations is associated with the demographic character of nations and the prevalence of autoimmunity.” That’s a paper by Bithika Chatterjee  Rajeeva Laxman Karandikar and Shekhar C Mande  published on the pre-print server medRxiv. The authors are from CSIR  National Centre for Cell Sciences  and Chennai Mathematical Institute. The paper  published in mid-October and not peer reviewed yet  suggests that the reason for this mystery could be the so-called “hygiene hypothesis”. “The hypothesis postulates that exposure to pathogens early in life protects people from allergic diseases later in their lives. Moreover  improvement in hygiene practices such as better sanitation  availability of safe drinking water  hand washing facilities etc. reduces the impact of communicable diseases. On the contrary  such a reduction to the exposure to infectious agents might be related to higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders ” the authors write.  They picked “GDP  HDI  prevalence of various diseases  demographic parameters  various sanitation parameters”  demographic data  the administration of the BCG vaccine  and measured the correlation between these and the case fatality rate to prove their hypothesis. With the old caveat that correlation doesn’t mean causation  I believe this is an interesting study that merits further exploration  including field studies (the authors based their paper on secondary research using published data). It is surprising that India’s federal health ministry or the Indian Council of Medical Research have not thought the achievements of Bihar and UP in managing the pandemic worthy of closer study. After all  why look to Germany or New Zealand as benchmarks when you have local ones (that you can be vocal about). Both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh predominantly use rapid antigen tests  which are unreliable. A New York Times report said on November 2 that one popular rapid antigen test (Sofia  made by Quidel) identified only “32% of positive cases identified by the” more accurate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR test). Other studies have shown that rapid antigen tests miss around half the positive cases (although some companies  including Abbott Laboratories  have launched what they claim are accurate rapid antigen tests). But the numbers in these states are far too low  even if one were to account for the use of such tests.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-i35lRUbtaTqNRX5d3SEjWK.html
05/11/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,australia,10k genetic markers key to a person’s height,Approximately 10 000 genetic markers may together hold the key to why some people are tall and others aren’t  according to the study of genomic data of over 4 million people by a team of researchers in Australia.,Approximately 10 000 genetic markers may together hold the key to why some people are tall and others aren’t  according to the study of genomic data of over 4 million people by a team of researchers in Australia.  The study says it has found markers that could explain close to 80% of variations in height  the most that can be attributed yet. This is in line with studies among identical twins that previously have projected that up to 80% of variation behind a person’s height could just be genes. “This is a genuine landmark ” Daniel MacArthur of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia told Science Mag  which first reported about the study. The report adds that the findings could open the door to new understanding that could eventually lead to personalised medicines. The analysis is based on a genomic study of 4.1 million individuals of European ancestries. Selecting a particular geographic ancestry enables the researchers to rule out the influence of nutrition and other environmental factors (such as exposure to different diseases) that may also play a role.  Such study  termed a genomewide association study (GWAS)  involves the mapping of genetic markers with different traits and diseases  and ultimately helps scientists zero in on sets of genes or genetic markers that could explain why some people have certain attributes or may be susceptible to certain diseases. The study by the Australian researchers  led by Loïc Yengo and Peter Visscher  is based on research spread over multiple years  the report adds. Over these years  this work has identified 9 900 genetic markers which may be a common factor.  What this essentially means is that someone with sets of these genetic markers common with another person is equally likely to be as tall or as short as them. The report  however  adds that “few of the height-linked DNA markers have been tied to specific genes that clearly alter the trait”. “It’s mostly all still ‘missing’ in a biological sense ” the Science report quoted David Goldstein of Columbia University as saying. But  largely  the findings raise the chances of researchers being able to whittle down these common genetic markers soon. Instead of being scattered randomly across the entire genome  which would make it challenging to ever get a handle on the specific genes and their roles  the 9 900 or so markers are confined to only about 30% of the genome  the report quoted Yengo as saying.  “And many cluster in areas known to contain genes involved in growth ” the study added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10k-genetic-markers-key-to-a-person-s-height/story-c0v2S9Dwv9tohK6XYJlxtO.html
05/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,RSS push for law on interfaith marriage,After four BJP-ruled states declared their intent to frame laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion or deception in marriage  the party’s ideological  mentor  the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)   is exerting pressure on other states to bar the practice they have dubbed “love jihad”.,After four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states declared their intent to frame laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion or deception in marriage  the party’s ideological  mentor  the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)   is exerting pressure on other states to bar the practice they have dubbed “love jihad”.  To be sure  religious conversion is protected by law and is a state subject. While a bunch of states already have laws in place that make conversion through inducement  coercion or deception an offence that invites  a jail term as well as a fine  the Sangh wants states to frame laws that specifically deal with conversion through interfaithmarriage.  Alok Kumar  the international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  an affiliate of the RSS  said the announcements by Uttar Pradesh  Assam  Madhya Pradesh and Haryana that they will explore legal options to prevent marriage for religious conversion are an outcome of the VHP’s longstanding demand.  “There is an urgent need to take steps. We have made this demand based on the ground situation. There are so many cases where Muslims enticed girls by posing as Hindus and revealed their identity only after marriage. Conversion through inducement and deception is not acceptable. These are demographic aggressors and it is a planned effort ” he said.  The VHP has petitioned all state governments to frame laws to regulate inter-faith marriages. “We have demanded there should be safeguards against such marriages and to make it mandatory for families on both sides to be given a month’s notice ahead of any interfaith marriage. And if marriage has been fraudulently conducted there should be deterrent punishment. We have asked all state governments  irrespective of which party is in power  to frame such laws. And we feel some [non-BJP] governments are also sensitized about this issue. In the past  when the laws against forceful conversion were drafted  it was during the Congress rule in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha ” Kumar said.  The VHP has also demanded that all interfaith marriages should be  registered and in case of complaints of a crime  an investigation should be completed within 30 days. “There should be fast-track courts to deal with such cases and the government should request the court to carry out the hearing on a day-to-day basis ” Kumar said.  Last week  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath referred to an order by the Allahabad high court  which said religious conversion is not necessary for marriage  to support his decision to enact a new law. “I warn those who conceal identity and play with the respect of our sisters. If you don’t mend your ways  your Ram Naam Satya journey will begin ” he said last week  referring to the slogan that Hindus chant while carrying the dead to the cremation site.  In Assam   health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said that if the BJP returns to power in 2021  it will start a “strict fight” against “love jihad” and there would be severe punishment for those who hide their religious identity in marriage.  In Haryana  chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also said his government was taking the love jihad issue very seriously as did Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan.  BJP leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said love jihad  based on complaints  needs to be addressed. “There are laws against forced conversion; interfaith marriages are conducted through the Special Marriage Act so there are safeguards in place. What else can be done to prevent deception will have to be legally weighed in ” said a senior party functionary.  The Congress has pronounced that such declaration would be unconstitutional. Former minister and Lok Sabha MP  Manish Tewari  said: “It is unconstitutional because the state has no right to interfere in the lives of two consenting adults. The state cannot transgress into peoples’ bedrooms; it is a violation of the fundamental right to privacy. The faith I profess is also guaranteed under the Constitution.”  His view was echoed by senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde  who said the state’s intervention in marriages between consenting adults will be a violation of rights. “I know there is love and I know there is the concept of jihad  but I don’t think there is something called love jihad. There are people who seem to have love for fights based on religion. Any law that prevents an adult from marrying any other adult of their choice will be unconstitutional on more grounds than one. It will be violation of privacy  it will be violation of the freedom of religion and will be manifest arbitrarily ” Hegde said.  The demand for more stringent checks against religious conversions is not new and has been raised in Parliament as well. As a member of the Lok Sabha in 2015  Yogi Adityanath had moved a private member’s bill seeking a ban on religious conversion. He had sought the insertion of a new article  25 (a)  in Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2015 that would ban forcible religious conversions. In 2015  Shiv Sena MP Sadashiv Lokhande introduced the Prohibition on Religious Conversion (by Inducement or Force) Bill 2015 in the Lok Sabha. The bill proposed a jail term of up to 10 years for those guilty of forced conversions and a fine of Rs.1 lakh.  Masoom Moradabadi  editor of Jadid Khabar and a former member of the All India Muslims Personal Law Board said instances such as the recent killing of a girl in Haryana’s Ballabgarh that are being cited as an evidence of love jihad should not been seen from a religious point of view.  “These are crimes that should be condemned. These are not acts based on religion. Such crimes can be carried out by people of any faith.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-push-for-law-on-interfaith-marriage/story-1wyUJxubzMhUqxvkF4wi6J.html

Senior counsel and Arnab Goswami’s lawyer Abad Ponda  said that they have moved a bail application  which is likely to be heard on Thursday.  Goswami was arrested from his residence in Mumbai’s Lower Parel this morning in connection with the death of an interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud Naik in 2018.  The 53-year-old interior designer had in his suicide note alleged that he and his mother were forced to ends their lives because he was not paid his dues worth to Rs 5.40 crore by Goswami and two others identified as Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda owners of two different firms  police said.  The designer and his mother were found dead at their farmhouse in Kavir village of Alibaug Taluka in May 2018. The case  which was closed by Raigad Police in 2019  was reopened when Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh ordered a re-investigation on the basis of a fresh complaint by Naik’s daughter  Adnya. Goswami was taken to Alibaug near Mumbai in Maharashtra’s Raigad district  where he was later produced before a local court. The news anchor told the court that he was assaulted by the police personnel who came to arrest him following which he was taken back to the police station where a civil surgeon was asked to verify the claims. The court later rejected Goswami’s allegations. The officer  who had earlier investigated abetment to suicide case was also arrested by the police on Wednesday. He will face inquiry  police was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The investigating officer had filed a closure report  saying there was no evidence  PTI added. A fresh first information report (FIR) was also filed against the Republic TV editor  his wife and two others by the Mumbai Police on Wednesday evening for resisting police officials who came to arrest him in the morning. While the Maharashtra government and Opposition parties are at loggerheads over Goswami’s arrest  the interior designer’s family has hailed the move with his daughter saying “We can’t forget the year 2018. We want to thank Maharashtra Police for standing by a daughter of Maharashtra.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-2-others-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-in-2018-suicide-abetment-case/story-U4xzxPeVfKfIb5IDhzy6iM.html

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Nitish Kumar clears air on citizenship law  rubbishes talk of evicting citizens out of country,“Who is spreading misinformation through such ‘phaalatoo baat’ (rubbish talk). Nobody has the courage to evict any citizen out of the country ” Kumar said while addressing public rallies in Kishanganj and Araria districts which comprise a significant number of those belonging to the minority communities.,On Wednesday  Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar during his rallies before the third and final phase of assembly election in the state dismissed concerns among a section of society that some people might be deported out of the country in the event of Centre’s implementation of new citizenship laws. He said  that such concerns are a ‘rubbish talk’ by those who are trying to “divide” the society. “Who is spreading misinformation through such ‘phaalatoo baat’ (rubbish talk). Nobody has the courage to evict any citizen out of the country ” Kumar said while addressing public rallies in Kishanganj and Araria districts which comprise a significant number of those belonging to the minority communities.  Amid the nationwide protests earlier this year and in 2019 over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and an all India National Register of Citizens (NRC)  the chief minister asserted that a nationwide implementation of NRC was needless and had no justification. Earlier  while peaking in the Bihar legislative assembly in January  Kumar said that NRC was an exercise confined to Assam as part of the accord signed by the Rajiv Gandhi government.  “A nationwide NRC would be needless and has no justification. We do not think any such thing is going to take place. I think the Prime Minister  too  has spoken clearly on this ” he said in January.  Meanwhile  targeting the opposition parties indirectly during his rallies  Kumar said some people want to promote fight between castes and religious groups and added his government has always worked for all sections of society and promoted communal harmony in Bihar.  Bihar witnessed polling in 94 constituencies across 17 districts in second phase on Tuesday. Data by the Election Commission of India (ECI) showed a voter turnout of over 53%.  Polling for the third and final phase will happen on November 7 in 78 constituencies. Counting of votes and declaration of results for all three phases will be on November 10.

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,ED summons Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s additional private secretary,The summons came on the day the state government revoked the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation to file cases in the state.,The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday summoned Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s additional private secretary CM Raveendran in connection with certain appointments in the information technology ministry. A political appointee  considered close to the CM  he was asked to appear in the ED office in Kochi on Friday. The summons came on the day the state government revoked the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation to file cases in the state. The CM’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar  a senior IAS officer  is in the custody of the ED in connection with the gold smuggling case.  While investigating the gold smuggling case  probe agencies came across alleged irregularities and commissions in some other projects also. According to officials who are part of the multi-agency probe  Raveendran was summoned on the basis of the statement of Sivasankar. A party leader from Kannur (north Kerala)  Raveendran had served under many ministers earlier. He was the secretary of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan when he was the home minister in the VS Achuthanandan government. When Sivasankar was arrested on October 28  the government quickly distanced itself from him but in Raveendran’s case it will be difficult for the party to drop him. Besides the government  the party (CPI(M) is also in big trouble after the arrest of secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with the Bengaluru drugs case.  Kodiyeri courted trouble after the Bengaluru drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad gave a statement to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in which he mentioned his name. He said Bineesh Kodiyeri  second son of Balakrishnan  had helped him a lot in his “business venture.” His name also figured prominently in the call list of Mohammad. In the remand report  the ED said he pumped in at least Rs 5 crore in drug business which began in 2015.  Kodiyeri’s arrest has landed the ruling party in big embarrassment and there are reports his father expressed desire to quit but central leaders prevailed over him  saying it will give an impression that charges were right and the party knew about his shoddy deals. The ED had raided his house and seven other establishments close to him on Wednesday.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-s-additional-private-secretary/story-fRQSixO0ioNE5urbQzpaHL.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,,Maoist in jail for 6 years gets bail from Orissa High Court after SC nudge,Nachika Linga is likely to be released once the trial court executes the order.,A key Maoist leader  who has been in jail for six years  in Odisha was on Wednesday granted bail by the Orissa High Court  a week after the Supreme Court asked it to dispose of his bail petition expeditiously. The single judge bench of justice AK Mishra  granted bail to 47-year-old Nachika Linga’s lawyer Prashant Jena said the court did not set any conditions for his bail and left it to the trial court in Koraput for the same. Linga is likely to be released once the trial court executes the order. Linga  who headed the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh  an overground organisation of CPI-Maoists in Narayanpatna and Bandhugaon blocks of Odisha’s Koraput district  had surrendered before the Odisha police in October 2014 near his village Podapadar. The Maoists  who had joined hands with Linga  had accused him of weakening the tribal agitation by joining hands with the BJD. A bonded labourer in Narayanpatna  Linga shot to prominence in 2006 when he formed the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh that captured some 50 acres of non-tribal land in the Podapadar gram panchayat of Narayanpatna block of Koraput district. He was swiftly arrested and charged with several cases  including one of being a Maoist. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008. In 2008  he  along with some CMAS members  formed another outfit called Ghenua Bahini whose members wore red shirts and were armed with traditional tribal weapons like bows and arrows. His group forcibly encroached lands of non-tribals  snatched their valuables and left many of them homeless. In 2009  he became the most wanted man for the Odisha police when he launched an armed attack on Narayanpatna police station leading to police firing that resulted in death of two tribals and injury to the inspector of the police station.  With the help of Maoists  he had almost become successful in turning Narayanpatna into a Maoist fortress till Odisha police struck back and took control of the area after three years. Of the 45 cases pending against him  Linga had been acquitted in 44 cases. The trial in the 2009 Narayanpatna police station attack is still going on. Linga’s lawyer Prashant Jena said he had first moved for bail petition before the Orissa HC in 2018 and then moved the SC in 2019 after his bail petition was rejected.  The apex court in March this year had asked the trial court in Koraput to finish trial in the Narayanpatna case within six weeks or give him bail if the same could not be done in time.  When the trial could not be finished within six weeks  Linga moved the trial court in Koraput seeking bail in April. However  the same was rejected amid Covid-19 lockdown.  The case finally went up to SC which on October 28 ordered Orissa High Court to conduct the bail hearing as it concerned the liberty of a person.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-in-jail-for-6-years-gets-bail-from-orissa-high-court/story-TbKt9Utt1Kw7qJALMWZpmK.html
05/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,china;peru,Proposal to raise retirement age  slash pensions in armed forces,The proposed cuts in pensions range from 25% to 50% of the entitled pension depending on an officer’s length of service at the time of leaving the job.,The department of military affairs (DMA) - headed by the chief of defence staff - has proposed to increase the retirement age of officers by one to three years  with a service extension of up to 17 years for the non-officer cadre from select branches  and is also considering a plan to cut pensions of officers opting for premature release from service in an attempt to retain skilled manpower  according to an official communication reviewed by Hindustan Times.  The increased retirement age of officers will allow colonels  brigadiers and major generals to serve longer  with jawans and junior commissioned officers from some non-combat branches also getting service extension that will see them retire at the age of 57 instead of around 40 to 52.  The proposed cuts in pensions range from 25% to 50% of the entitled pension depending on an officer’s length of service at the time of leaving the job.  While the proposal for service extension has been hailed in military circles as a welcome step  the plan to review pensions has invited criticism from many in the serving and retired community.  The letter  dated October 29  has proposed that colonels would serve till the age of 57 (instead of the current 54)  brigadiers up to 58 (up from 56) and major generals till 59 as against the current 58. No change has been proposed in the retirement age of lieutenant generals  it stays at 60.  This applies to equivalent ranks in the air force and the navy but does not cover officers from the medical and nursing wings.  Junior commissioned officers and other ranks from logistics  technical and medical branches will retire at the age of 57 instead of 40 to 52 (depending on the rank).  The proposed pension review is the most significant move under consideration  officials familiar with developments said. Officers who seek premature release after 20-25 years of service will get only 50% of the entitled pension  those leaving after 26 to 30 years will get 60% and officers quitting after 31 to 35 years of service will draw 75% of the entitled pension  according to the letter. Only those with 35-plus years of service will get full pension.  The letter states there are several specialists/super specialists who are trained for highly skilled jobs in the services but quit to work in other sectors. “Such loss of high skilled manpower results in a void in the services skill matrix and is counter-productive to the armed forces. In view of this  it has been decided to review the pension entitlements ” the letter adds.  The communication has set November 10 as the deadline for preparing a draft government sanction letter on increasing retirement age and reviewing pensions for perusal by CDS General Bipin Rawat.  Extension of service is a good step  both for the organisation in retaining quality and trained manpower as also in congruence with individual aspirations  said military affairs expert Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd).  “The pension slabs could be an incentive for deadwood to continue which is neither good for the organisation nor does it optimise financial resources. The key issue is that on account of Covid-19 and China’s aggressive behaviour along the Line of Actual Control  the armed forces will be required to do more and more with less and less. There is no choice but to ensure optimal utilisation of the financial resources ” said Bhatia.  The DMA’s proposals will benefit the organisation and meet individual aspirations  said military officials asking not to be identified.  “Almost all colonels and most brigadiers seek re-employment on retirement. On grant of re-employment  highly qualified officers and experts in particular domains are employed in appointments held by captains and majors. This adversely impacts both the organisation and the officer himself whose job satisfaction takes a hit ” the officials said  commenting on the service extension being proposed for officers in these ranks.  On the proposal regarding service extension for the non-officer cadre from non-combat arms  the officials said the military invests time and resources on training technicians to make them capable of undertaking specialised tasks but they come up for retirement when their professional skill is at its peak.  On the cut in pensions  the officials said  “Only officers taking premature release will be affected. Individuals who complete their pensionable age as per terms of engagement are not affected.”  They explained  “If someone becomes an officer at the age of 25 or even more (jawans can become officers even in their late 20s if they clear certain exams and an interview)  it doesn’t mean they have to complete 35 years of service for full pension. The cuts will only be applicable to officers to seek early release.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proposal-to-raise-retirement-age-slash-pensions-across-armed-forces/story-R6upqug8UiYYrSUv2vcIkJ.html

Second batch of IAF #Rafale aircraft arrived in India at 8:14 pm on 04 Nov 20 after flying non-stop from France. An official had earlier said  “The three jets will not have a stopover on their way. They will be refueled by French and Indian tankers during the journey. The jets are expected to reach Ambala after a one-day break at Jamnagar ” the officials said. The first batch of five Rafale jets of the 36 ordered by the IAF had reached the Ambala airbase on July 29 after a stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi  although a formal induction ceremony took place later on September 10. An Indian Air Force team  led by a two-star officer  reviewed the progress of the Rafale project in France last month ahead of the arrival of the second batch of fighters  as reported by Hindustan Times on October 16.  The arrival of more fighters will further boost the IAF’s capability to rapidly deploy the advanced jets amid tensions with neighbouring China and Pakistan  officials had earlier said.

They have significantly enhanced the offensive capabilities of the IAF. Rafale fighter jets are currently being operated in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert to deal with any provocation by China amid the border standoff.  The jets were ordered from France in September 2016 under a government-to-government deal worth Rs59 000 crore.

The railways said it has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 1 200 crore due to the protests.,Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda has written a letter to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh about the ongoing protests in the state against the farm last passed by Parliament. In the letter  Nadda has held Amarinder government for the situation in the case and claimed it is not doing anything to control the protests. “You and your party started opposing these acts crossing all limits of decency and propriety. You and your party openly encouraged agitations against these acts in the state of Punjab  participated in dharnas and rallies and openly issued very provocative statements encouraging agitations against these acts ” Nadda said in the letter. “Your government added fuel to the fire by openly declaring that you will not lodge any FIR against the agitators  even if they indulge in road dharnas  Railway Tracks blocking etc ” he added. My response to open letter of Punjab CM @capt_amarinder  that he had written to me on 1st November 2020  as per media reports  although till this moment I have not received any such letter from his side  still I am replying to his letter received by me through this media.

This has been reiterated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2009 ” he said in the letter. “However  I am pained to say that you  your party and your government in Punjab have shown little respect and regard for the directions of the Supreme Court and openly encouraged blockade of roads  railway tracks and railway stations ” the BJP chief added.

But Nadda said that the BJP govermment at the Centre respects the farmers. “The farmers of Punjab have always been a pride of the nation and it is for this reason that the central government accords the highest priority in matters of MSP procurement to the state ” said Nadda.

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,Man’s body in mortuary for 18 days as BJP and Trinamool slug it out in court,The BJP said the man  Madan Ghorui  was a party supporter and alleged that he died because of torture in judicial custody. This triggered a legal battle at the Calcutta High Court and Ghorui’s body was sent back to the morgue hours after it was handed over to his family following post mortem examination.,The body of Madan Ghorui  a villager from Patashpur in East Midnapore district  is lying in a morgue since October 16 because of a legal battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government.  The BJP said Ghorui was a party supporter and alleged that he died because of torture in judicial custody. This triggered a legal battle at the Calcutta High Court and Ghorui’s body was sent back to the morgue hours after it was handed over to his family following post mortem examination. On Tuesday  the court ordered that a second post mortem examination be done by Thursday to ascertain the cause of death.  Ghorui was arrested on September 27 in connection with an alleged kidnapping of a minor girl in which one of his relatives was the accused. He died of illness at SSKM hospital in Kolkata on October 13  said the police. The body was handed over to Ghorui’s family on the morning of October 16 after a post mortem examination.  Lok Sabha MP Locket Chatterjee staged a demonstration near the party’s state headquarters on Central Avenue with the body kept in a hearse. She demanded an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).  Within hours  a legal battle started with the Calcutta High Court issuing back-to-back orders on separate petitions moved by the BJP and the state government. “We have not witnessed something like this in recent history ” said one of the public prosecutors who did not wish to be quoted.  After hearing a plea moved by the brother of the deceased  who demanded investigation into the alleged custodial death  the single bench of justice Rajasekhar Mantha on October 16 ordered a second post mortem examination. The government told the judge that Ghorui fell ill in judicial custody in East Midnapore district and was taken to a local hospital and later shifted to SSKM Hospital.  Challenging the single-bench ruling  the state government moved the division bench of justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee on the evening of October 16. The division bench ordered a stay on the second post mortem examination and referred the case back to the single bench. It said the government should be given time to prepare its reply and in the meantime the body must be preserved.  During the next hearing on October 20  Swapan Ghorui  the brother of the deceased and the one who signed the petition  demanded an investigation and alleged foul play by the administration. The single-bench once again ordered a second post mortem examination. The government challenged this and moved the division bench. On Tuesday  the division bench upheld the order of the single-bench.  The single-judge bench had ruled that the second post mortem examination should be done at Kolkata’s R G Kar Hospital under the supervision of the department’s head and the entire process must be recorded on video.  The division bench on Tuesday said that two members from Ghorui‘s family can be present during the examination which has to be conducted by a committee of experts from R G Kar Hospital.  The two-judge bench also said that the post mortem examination report as well as all documents relating to Ghorui’s treatment at SSKM Hospital and Contai hospital  where he was admitted first  have to be submitted before the bench on November 10.  “The police could not find the accused and arrested my brother. We were not informed that he had fallen ill. All we want now is to take the body home and perform the last rites.

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Rs 1 200 crore losses amid protest along tracks in Punjab  says railways,Protests along railway tracks in Punjab are currently still underway in 32 places due to which train movement remains suspended  said the railway ministry on Wednesday.,Amid tussle between the Centre and the Punjab state government over allowing the passage of trains in the state  the Indian Railways has claimed losses of nearly Rs 1 200 crore in freight revenue with more than 2 225 goods trains suspended and 1 350 passenger trains cancelled and diverted. Trains have been suspended in the state for over a month from September 25 due to the agitation over farm bills  cleared by the Centre during the monsoon session of Parliament. According to railways’ data  nearly 70 trains are affected per day  in total 1 373 passenger trains have had to be cancelled and diverted leading to losses of Rs 45 crore due to cancellation of the passenger trains. Protests along railway tracks in Punjab are currently still underway in 32 places due to which train movement remains suspended  said the railway ministry on Wednesday. “Agitators have continued dharna at platforms/near railway tracks. Train movement again suspended due to operational and safety considerations as agitators have suddenly stopped some train movements and sporadic blockade continued at various places like especially around Jandiala  Nabha  Talwandi Sabo and Bathinda ” a railway ministry spokesperson said. “All passenger trains passing through the state of Punjab have been adversely impacted too. Till date more than 1 350 passenger trains have been cancelled  diverted or short terminated. This has caused tremendous inconvenience to travellers in Covid times ” he added. According to the Centre  all inward and outward goods transportation  including essential commodities  has adversely been affected in the northern states and Punjab  Jammu & Kashmir  Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh According to the railway ministry  a number of freight trains  including loaded good trains  remain stuck due to the suspension for nearly 15-20 days. “Many freight customers  after having suffered business losses  are getting diverted to other modes of transportation. Outward loading too has been affected from the Punjab area. Movement of foodgrain  container  automobile  cement  pet coke  fertilizer  etc has taken a hit; average loss of loading per day in Punjab is 40 rakes per day ” the ministry spokesperson said. “Inward traffic to Punjab has been affected (Outward from other than Punjab Area) and now container  cement  gypsum  fertilizer  POL  etc  are not being able to reach key locations in Punjab. Over all  the average loss per day is about 30 rakes per day ” he added. The Centre’s statement also comes on the day the Punjab CM led a relay dharna of MLAs at Delhi’s Rajghat after the President declined to give time for a meeting. The CM claimed to have sought time “to highlight the state’s power crisis and critical essential supplies situation” amid tussle with the Centre over resumption of trains. Railway minister Piyush Goyal on October 26  had written to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh  seeking Punjab government’s assurance of the safety of trains and their crew members to restore freight services  hours after the CM asked him to intervene in resuming the same. Goyal  in his letter  had alleged sporadic obstruction of tracks was still continuing at many places  especially around Amritsar and outside the power plants at Naba and Talwandi Saboo  and also outside the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) silo at Moga. HT has reviewed the letter. Goyal also said some of the freight trains and empty coaching rakes were obstructed again on October 23 after which railway drivers and guards refused to operate trains in Punjab unless they are assured that trains will not be obstructed. The Punjab chief minister on Monday also wrote an open letter to BJP president JP Nadda  seeking intervention to stop the suspension of goods trains by the railways. “What is needed at this critical moment is for all of us to put aside any temptations we may be harbouring to promote our political interests ” the Punjab CM wrote. Earlier in October  CM Singh had appealed to farmers to relax their ongoing ‘Rail Roko’ protest to allow goods trains to pass-through. He had  however  reiterated his government’s support to the farmers in their fight against the farm reform laws.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-1-200-crore-losses-amid-protest-along-tracks-in-punjab-says-railways/story-ACRiJ4fEasaTZB1VQJzWEK.html
04/11/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;india;pakistan,India test-fires long range Pinaka rocket system  will be deployed to counter China,Pinaka rockets are part of the multi-barrel rocket launcher systems which are already being used by the Army and have been successfully deployed in operations in both China and Pakistan.,India on Wednesday successfully flight-tested the enhanced version of Pinaka multi-barrel rocket system (MRLS). Indigenously developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)  the enhanced Pinaka along with guidance Pinaka will cover the range between 60 to 90 kilometres and will be deployed by the Indian Army. The test-flight was carried out from Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur  off the coast of Odisha. The DRDO said that this new rocket system has a longer range with reduced length compared to the earlier variant (Mk-1)  which will now be phased out. The design and development has been carried out by Pune-based laboratories of DRDO  Armament Research & Development Establishment (ARDE) and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL). Watch: DRDO successfully test-fires advanced version of Pinaka rockets “A total of six rockets were launched in quick succession and the tests met complete mission objectives ” the DRDO said after the test-fire. All the flight articles were tracked by range instruments such as telemetry  radar and Electro Optical Tracking Systems (EOTS) which confirmed the flight performance  it further said. The enhanced version of the Pinaka rocket would replace the existing Pinaka Mk-1 rockets. While Mk-1 had a range of 36 km  this enhanced variant can hit a target 45 to 60 km away and has been developed as per requirements of the Indian Army.  The DRDO had last year tested guided Pinaka rocket system which has a range of 70-90 km  but this improved version of Mk-1  which was test-fired today  can fill a critical gap of hitting targets that are not so far away. The guided Pinaka is more of a missile that can be pin-pointed on the target.  “The enhanced Pinaka has been developed to counter the People’s Liberation Army threat in East Ladakh with the Chinese deploying large number of rocket regiments in support of artillery guns. The rocket regiments are central to Chinese war fighting for saturation bombardment of the targets. The enhanced Pinaka and guided Pinaka have both been cleared for deployment on the borders ”said a senior DRDO official.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-enhanced-version-of-pinaka-rocket-system/story-waLts08Nqlq01cwHhACqjN.html

The central agencies were given the Central Reserve Police Force protection.,The house of Bineesh Kodiyeri - son of the state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  Kodiyeri Balakrishnan - and seven other spots in Thiruvananthapuram were raided on Wednesday by the Enforcement Directorate probing the money laundering case related to Bengaluru drug haul even as the state government withdrew general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation.  A joint team of ED and Income Tax searched the house of Kodiyeri and business establishments of his friends and partners simultaneously. The central agencies were given the Central Reserve Police Force protection. There were intelligence reports that left youth outfits may protest against the raid.  Arrested on October 29  Kodiyeri is under the ED custody in Bengaluru. He landed in trouble after the Bengaluru drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad gave a statement to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)  saying that Kodiyeri had helped him a lot in his “business venture”. Later his name also figured in the call list of Mohammad. He was arraigned as the sixth accused in the money laundering case connected to drug haul.  During investigation in the gold smuggling case  multiple agencies also found that drug and smuggling cases were interconnected. One of the accused in gold smuggling KT Ramees and alleged drug peddler Mohammad were thick friends. They also found that Ramees had made several trips to Bengaluru before his arrest. The ED suspects that huge properties owned by Kodiyeri in Kerala and Karnataka might have been bought with the proceeds of narcotics and gold smuggling. Meanwhile  the government has decided to withdraw the general consent given to the CBI to investigate cases in the state like four other opposition-ruled states. “We will not allow free run of central agencies in the state. They are in a race to portray the state government in bad light ” said state law minister AK Balan. Last month  the state government had to rush to the High Court to quash the CBI probe into the Life Mission project. The court stayed it for two months. It is a scheme to build free dwelling units for the homeless  but irregularities came to light when central agencies were probing the gold smuggling case.  When lockers of the main accused in the smuggling case  Swapna Suresh  were opened they got Rs one crore cash and two kg gold. Later she reportedly told agencies that this was the commission she received for clinching a deal with an international aid agency ‘Red Crescent’  which funded the Life Mission project in Vadakkanchery in the Thrissur district.  The anti-corruption unit of the CBI later registered a case under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). But the state government maintained that it will not come under the purview of the FCRA and moved the court.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bineesh-kodiyeri-s-residence-many-locations-in-kerala-raided-in-drug-case/story-Wlrl3AAoA9rvkLrqtqUSdM.html

It is not. We are there to preserve the peace of the country. We have given blood many times in the past and we will never shy away from doing so in future ’ Singh said.  He made the remark while addressing a gathering at a protest launched by lawmakers from Punjab against the Centre’s recently-enacted farm laws at Jantar Mantar in the national capital. Also read | Chhattisgarh passes amendment bill to counter Centre’s farm bills The protests was organised after President Ram Nath Kovind reportedly refused to meet a delegation from the state  led by CM Singh  on three farm bills passed by the state assembly in October.  Earlier on Wednesday morning  Singh along with some Congress Members of Parliament (MPs) and legislators from Punjab paid tributes to Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi at Raj Ghat in the national capital.  “Never think that Punjab will do anything anti-national. We have Pakistan as our neighbour  which is continuously trying to provoke us by sending up to three drones daily to drop arms and ammunition. These weapons are likely to go into the hands of criminals and anti-nationals. We have shared our inputs and apprehensions with the Central government. We don’t want trouble in Punjab because it is a border state. If law and order situation worsens in Punjab  then it will impact the country’s security ” Singh added.  Former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu also joined the protest  indicating a thaw in his ties with the CM at the intervention of the Congress leadership.  Lok Insaaf Party legislator Simranjit Singh Bains  Punjabi Ekta Party lawmaker Sukhpal Khaira and Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) legislator Parminder Singh Dhindsa were also present on the occasion.  The Congress  many other opposition parties and several farmers’ organisations have been protesting against the recent farm legislations  alleging that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporate entities. The claim has been denied by the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.  The Centre has asserted that these new laws would be beneficial for farmers and would also increase their income.  The three farm bills -- the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill  2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill  2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill  2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September.  In October  the Punjab assembly adopted a resolution  rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws and passed three bills to counter the contentious legislation enacted by Parliament.  Singh urged President Kovind to give his assent to the farm bills submitted to Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore on October 20.  The CM invoked former Union minister Arun Jaitley and said the late Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader had asked the BJP-ruled states in 2016 to make their own laws on Concurrent List of Business in line with the provisions in the Constitution to override the land acquisition law passed by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2013.  “The bills are with the Raj Bhavan. I don’t know why the Governor is holding back these bills. He has no role to play. A Governor is only a post box and it is his duty to forward any such bill to the President. He doesn’t have to give any comments ” the CM said.  “I wanted to meet President Kovind because he is the head of our country and it is my duty to brief him on both law and order and food security situation in my state. It is for him to take a call. We hope that he will give his assent to the bills ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-at-jantar-mantar-protest-punjab-cm-flays-those-calling-his-state-anti-national/story-YseTCYzFzLjxnoZ4dWzfxL.html

We do believe that we have forged a relationship that today has withstood the test of time  is very comprehensive and multi-faceted ” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ties with Trump “have been special”  he said  noting that Modi’s “relationship with [former president Barack] Obama was also very special”.  Asked about the border standoff with China in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC)  Shringla replied  “Clearly there we believe that the situation has involved some level of deterioration...it has contributed to deterioration in terms of the ties between our two countries because of the unusual step of China to seek to unilaterally alter the status quo.”  Shringla responded to questions on whether China had occupied territory on the Indian side of the LAC by saying  “You have to keep in mind that there is no common perception of the border  but yet if you seek to change where the current line where troops are  then of course it does impact on the larger relationship.  “We are concerned that China has taken this step. We are very  very clear that we will stand firm and resolute in our resolve not to allow our territorial integrity or sovereignty to be compromised.”  Responding to a question on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad grouping that comprises India  Australia  Japan and the US  Shringla said  “The Quad is a grouping of countries which have the same vision of a free  open and transparent Indo-Pacific region  an international rules-based order  international freedom of navigation in global commons and also issues such as open connectivity [and] respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.”  The members of the Quad are “working to bolster the capacities and abilities of countries in the Indo-Pacific  with Asean as its centrality  in a manner that is both constructive and cooperative”.  Shringla was scathing in his response to a question about Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan describing the government of India as “fascist”  and said  “That is ripe coming from the prime minister of a country that does not recognise the state of Israel  that till now does not acknowledge that the Holocaust took place  that has provided a safe sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar of the Taliban years after 9/11  a country that today has a debt higher than its GDP  a country that has enormous socio-economic problems and political problems now with an entire coalition of all the opposition parties seeking to unseat Prime Minister Imran Khan and those who back him from the deep state.”  He said the remarks were “an attempt to distract international attention and domestic attention” from Khan’s problems. “Considering his situation and Pakistan’s own approach towards radicalism  terrorism and issues that are important to the international community  he really shouldn’t be making such irresponsible statements ” he added.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/us-presidential-election/us-election-2020-outcome-unlikely-to-impact-ties-between-two-countries-says-foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla/story-aZ6w1DW8qTePtmc62HZEjK.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india;united states,India’s services activity grew in October for first time in 8 months  survey shows,The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) climbed to 54.1 in October  the highest since February. The PMI was 49.8 in September.,Activity in India’s dominant services industry  expanded for the first time in eight months in October as demand surged  but pandemic hit firms continued to cut jobs  a private survey showed on Wednesday. The findings  coupled with a similar survey on Monday which found Indian manufacturing growth expanded at its fastest pace in over a decade  suggest a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy is under way. The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index(PMI) climbed to 54.1 in October from September’s 49.8. It was the highest reading since February and comfortably above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. “It’s encouraging to see the Indian service sector joining its manufacturing counterpart and posting a recovery in economic conditions from the steep deteriorations caused by the Covid-19 pandemic earlier in the year ” Pollyanna De Lima  economics associate director at IHS Markit  said in a release. “Service providers signalled solid expansions in new work and business activity during October. They were also more upbeat about the outlook  though hopes of output growth in the year ahead were pinned on a Covid-19 vaccine.” A sub-index tracking overall demand showed it expanded for the first time since February but new export business remained firmly in contraction territory as restrictions imposed across the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic hammered foreign demand. That led firms to cut jobs for the eight straight month  the longest streak on record. “Survey participants indicated that workers on leave had not returned and that a widespread fear of Covid-19 contamination continued to restrict staff supply ” De Lima added. The composite PMI  which includes both manufacturing and services  rose to 58.0 last month  its highest since January 2012  from September’s 54.6. Although service providers remained optimistic about the year ahead  optimism strengthened to a seven-month high last month  the expectations index remained well below the long-term average. Input costs increased at the quickest pace since February but firms absorbed much of the jump to win business amid growing concerns that rising coronavirus infections could halt the nascent recovery in the services industry  which contributes over 60% to the country’s gross domestic product. India has the world’s second-highest coronavirus caseload at well over 8 million  behind only the United States. New daily cases in India have been falling since September  but experts warn infections could rise again during the festival season.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/india-s-services-activity-grew-in-october-for-first-time-in-8-months-survey-shows/story-8gzPjAqctOfT8Nom0sBv3L.html

The decision  which was on the table for quite some time  was finalised in the Cabinet meeting. From now on  the probe agency will have to seek prior permission from the state government before registering a case in the state. Recently  Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi government decided to block the CBI in the stats. The decision saw an uproar as the decision was announced a day after CBI decided to investigate the TRP scam in Maharashtra. The state government is at a critical juncture where it is raging several wars against the Centre. Blocking CBI in the state  therefore  was seen as a salvo against the Centre which raised doubt over Mumbai Police’s investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.  Also Read: Maharashtra withdraws consent to CBI for probes in state CBI comes under the DSPE Act and it requires states to give the agency a general consent to act against central government employees within a state as public order and police come under the state governments  which routinely renew this permission. In late 2018  West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh withdrew the general consent to CBI for investigations  alleging that the Centre was misusing the agency to harass opponents. However  the government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy  which came into power in Andhra 2019  reversed the decision. Chhattisgarh  ruled by the Congress  withdrew the general consent to CBI in January 2019. And in July 2020  the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan followed suit. The Kerala government and the CBI are at odds owing to the latter’s ongoing probe into Life Mission  a state housing project for the homeless. The CBI was probing alleged irregularities in this project. In October  the Kerala high court stayed CBI investigation considering a plea by the state government.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-withdraws-consent-to-cbi-for-probes-in-state/story-P5e1yvYPMcggE1Gs7nnybP.html

The Republic Television editor  who is at loggerheads with the Maharashtra state government over a slew of recent incidents including Sushant Singh Rajput death investigation  TRP scam etc  was detained by Alibaugh Police on Wednesday morning.

Several Union ministers including Prakash Javadekar  Ravi Shankar Prasad  Smriti Irani denounced the attack on press freedom. BJP chief JP Nadda too termed the arrest as ‘shameful’.  Congress and its allies have shamed democracy once again.Blatant misuse of state power against Republic TV & Arnab Goswami is an attack on individual freedom and the 4th pillar of democracy.It reminds us of the Emergency.

Blaming the Congress and allies for “shaming democracy”  Amit Shah said the incident is a “blatant misuse of state power” against Republic TV and Arnab Goswami. “It reminds us of the Emergency. This attack on free press must be and WILL BE OPPOSED ” the Union minister tweeted. The Republic Television has issued a statement and said all allegations against Arnab Goswami are unfounded.  A 53-year-old interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud Naik died by suicide in Alibaug in May 2018. A suicide note purportedly written by Anvay was found in which he said that Goswami and two others — Feroz Shaikh and Niteish Sarda —had not paid him Rs 5.40 crore which led to his financial constraints. “ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd has paid over 90 per cent of the amounts due to deceased Anvay Naik’s company Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd as per the terms of the work orders issued  over two years ago.

The journalist was first detained from his Mumbai residence and then arrested. BJP president JP Nadda took to Twitter and denounced the arrest without mincing ay word.

Union ministers Prakash Javadekar  Smriti Irani too condemned the arrest and blamed the Congress for the arrest. “Emergency came to an end in 1977 but the tendency of imposing it still persists. After Shiv Sena  which stood by the emergency and Congress  the party which imposed it joined hands in the state  the tendency has surfaced. Such attempts of suppressing the voice against government is detrimental to democracy. Country has always stood against such attempts ” former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted in Marathi. Though there has been no statement from the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on this arrest so far  Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut quashed all these “vendetta” allegations and said that whatever has been done has followed due course of law. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant termed the arrest as a tribute to late Anway Naik. “Anway Naik and his mother were compelled to commit suicide after Arnab’s channel failed to pay his dues worth Rs 80 lakh. The Fadnavis government failed to investigate the case and do justice with the family of the deceased. There was a lot of political pressure on the then Fadnavis government to hush up the case for the obvious reasons. The Modi government was protecting Arnab just because his channel was taking their agenda forward. Instead of condemning the action against the culprit  the BJP should feel ashamed for their failure to accord justice to Naik family. We welcome the action taken by the MVA government ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-arrested-shameful-says-bjp-chief-jp-nadda-who-speaks-if-you-are-next-asks-smriti-irani/story-GrIKydNoV1sGVvgDXFKbzH.html

The WHO had declared India polio-free in 2014  following a  sustained aggressive  programme of administering polio vaccine to newborns across the country by the Central government.  However  in West Singhbhum district  where every second child is malnourished  samples of 64 children since 2014 have been sent to IIS for polio tests. Polio virus was not found in any of these samples tested till date. Polio is mostly prevalent among children under 15 years of age.  “This is the first suspected case of polio from Manoharpur-Anandpur block in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. We have sent the stool sample of the 6-year-old boy to IIS-Kolkata for testing. The report will come in 15 days from IIS which will conclusively tell us if this is the first confirmed case of polio. If the presence of polio virus is not detected  we will further try to diagnose the reasons for the boy’s problems ” Dr Suman  WHO coordinator for Chaibasa  said. She said they would have to go for differential diagnosis to find out the exact reason for the weak and flabby muscles of the boy – acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) – if polio virus is not found in the testing. “Apart from polio  guillain barre syndrome (GBS)  transverse myelitis  traumatic neuritis  transient paralysis  facial palsy and paresis too may lead to AFP. There is no reason to panic as of now because samples of 64 suspected cases of polio were sent to IIS from Chaibasa during the past three years and none have tested positive so far ” Dr Suman said. In 2018  13 samples for suspected cases of polio 32 samples in 2019 from West Singhbhum were sent for testing to IIS-Kolkata. This year  19 samples have been sent for testing so far. None of the samples since 2018 have tested positive. West Singhbhum district civil surgeon Dr OP Gupta said the doctors in Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela suspected that the boy had polio after testing there and sent their report to the Chaibasa Sadar Hospital (CSH). “We immediately decided to get tests done at IIS and informed the district WHO coordinator ” Dr Gupta said. The boy had been suffering from high fever for almost three weeks when he was admitted in Manoharpur CHC on October 16.

BJP’s national general secretary in-charge of South India  CT Ravi said Tuesday that the state government would bring a law to ban religious conversion for the sake of marriage. He also said that anyone involved in conversion activity shall face swift and severe punishment. Ravi recently resigned as the tourism minister of the state after being elevated as the national general secretary in the new team of BJP chief JP Nadda but the resignation is yet to be accepted formally by the Governor.  “On lines of Allahabad High Court’s order  Karnataka will enact a law banning religious conversions for the sake of marriage. We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of Our Sisters. Any one involved in the act of conversion shall face severe & swift punishment ” he said in a tweet. On Monday  deputy CM Ashwath Narayan had also said that the state would examine similar legislation being proposed in Uttar Pradesh before taking any concrete decision on religious conversion. Last month  the Allahabad High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by a married couple seeking police protection. The high court noted the woman was a Muslim and converted to Hinduism just a month before she got married.  Interfaith relationships  euphemistically called love jihad by Hindu activists  have become a controversial issue  in several states where Hindu right wingers allege that Muslim men “lure” gullible women for conversion.  Many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February  the Union home ministry told Parliament that there was no definition of the term love jihad and no such cases were reported by agencies.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-enact-law-against-religious-conversion-for-marriage-bjp-gen-secy/story-wmV323mgUCN4hTKoSMyDUP.html

If you see the robust studies  it raises questions about the utility of these drugs. ...even without antivirals and other experimental drugs patients recovered on their own with supportive treatment. So  there has to be a judicious use and doctors have to consider when not to use these medicines ” said AIIMS director Randeep Guleria at a virtual interactive session of doctors from across the country to discuss trends in Covid-19 treatment. Doctors cited data and said 300 patients with moderate to severe symptoms were given steroids – the only medicine to have shown benefits in reducing mortality. Only about one-third were given the antiviral drug Remdesivir. Also read | Active Covid-19 cases declining  but surge in four states: Govt “The medicine was roughly given to one-third of the patients in moderate as well as severe categories. It was given only to those who presented within one week of symptoms and might benefit from it ” said Dr Sujay HS  a resident doctor from the department of medicine  AIIMS. Dr Manish Soneja  an additional professor from the same department  while presenting the evidence on some of the experimental therapies being used in India  said that randomised control trials did not show benefits of anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine  Remdesivir  or convalescent plasma therapy. Nonetheless  Remdesivir has since received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Dr Soneja said well-designed randomised control trials were needed to prove the efficacy of antiviral medicine Favipiravir and anti-parasitic Ivermectin. “A laboratory study had shown that Ivermectin reduces the viral load by 5 000 times in 48 hours. However  the doses needed for that is 35 times what is usually prescribed and may be toxic. Whether it is effective at the current dosage  we do not know. We will need randomised control trial to see. As for Tocilizumab  a cohort study has shown 10% lower mortality in ICU [intensive care unit] patients if given within two days of admission. However  two randomised control trials from France and Italy did not show any major benefits ” said Dr Soneja. The doctors have also reviewed the status of vaccine development. “Currently  there are 193 vaccine candidates across the world in different stages of development. Of these  42 are in clinical phases [meaning they are being trialed on humans]. Ten vaccines are in the advanced phase III trial needed before approval. And two Russian vaccines have been approved without phase III trial ” said Dr Sanjay Rai  head of the department of community medicine  AIIMS. He is leading a trial on Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at AIIMS  Delhi. As per data  33% of all the vaccines under development are subunit vaccines wherein the viral protein is injected to generate an immune response. This is followed by 12% vaccines using a non-replicating viral vector that uses another virus without its ability to cause disease to deliver the antigen of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. The doctors said Hydroxychloroquine has failed as an experimental treatment since it did not show any impact in three randomised control trials  which are the gold standard for evaluating new therapies. India still recommends the use of the medicine for the treatment of mild Covid-19 patients as well as a prophylaxis to prevent the infection.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-do-not-overuse-experimental-therapies-warn-aiims-doctors/story-WN9GiN6GDrwrFXiuxzT03O.html

The senior bureaucrat held out hope for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-battered economy  which he said was recovering fast and an imminent third stimulus would further accelerate its growth. The PM will preside over the Virtual Global Investor Roundtable-20 (VGIR-20) on Thursday (November 5). It would focus on discussions around India’s economic and investment outlook  structural reforms and the government’s vision for the path to a $5 trillion economy  Bajaj said. The roundtable would be attended by the world’s 20 largest pension and sovereign wealth funds  who have around $6 trillion assets under their management  he said.  These global institutional investors represent key regions including the United States of America (USA)  Europe  Canada  Korea  Japan  the Middle East  Australia  and Singapore  he added. Bajaj said some of them are looking at India as an investment destination for the first time. Some of the prominent funds that would be participating in the event are Australian Super  British Columbia Investment Management Corporation  Future Fund  GIC  Japan Post Bank  Japan Bank for International Cooperation  Korean Investment Corporation  Mubadala  Nippon Life  Pension Denmark  Qatar Investment Authority and US International Development Finance Corporation.  “We also have major Indian industrialists  six of them who will also participate in this conference to share their experience... They are Mr Deepak Parekh  Mr Dilip Sanghvi  Mr Mukesh Ambani  Mr Nandan Nilekani  Mr Ratan Tata and Mr Uday Kotak ” he said. The PM would hold a one-to-one virtual interaction with each investor over the next two weeks  he added. Bajaj said the Indian economy was showing strong signs of recovery as this was the opportune moment for the government to engage with global investors  who are looking for an alternative market to China.  In September  Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing was highest in a decade at 56.8.  The PMI  which had plunged below 40 in the first four months of the current financial year  was at 49.8 in September  and close to the benchmark of 50.  An index of over 50 in PMI indicates expansion. Bajaj said the PMI services data in October  which is expected soon  might also indicate an expansion. He said several other indicators such as a 10% growth in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in October indicate that the economy was fast emerging out of the adverse impact due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. India  which is Asia’s third-largest economy after China and Japan  had seen a record 23.9% contraction in the first quarter of the current financial year because of the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions since March 25.  The lockdown had stopped production activities at most factories  closed business establishments  triggered a massive exodus of migrant workers from cities back to their native places in rural India and confined the public indoors in urban and semi-urban spaces. Bajaj said the government started consultations with stakeholders before announcing a third stimulus to provide additional impetus to the economy soon. “We are discussing those lines. It is difficult for me to commit a date. But we have received a lot of requests and comments from various sectors and we are looking into them ” he said.  Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would unveil a third stimulus soon  he added. Sitharaman had said on October 19 that the government  which has started a mid-year review of the economy  is open to offering another stimulus package. She had announced two packages to revive the economy from the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Between March 26 and May 17  the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government unveiled Rs.20.97 trillion of stimulus-cum-relief measures.  A demand stimulus package consisting of Rs 730 000 million in public expenditure was announced on October 12. Divakar Vijayasarathy  founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP  said  “Global corporate heads meeting the highest level of policymakers will facilitate hearing directly from the horses’ mouth. In times of uncertainty such as the Covid-19 pandemic  such a clear policy communication is essential.” He said: “The timing also coincided well with the recent announcement of GST collections crossing Rs. 1 trillion after nearly eight months  manufacturing PMI rebounding and with the announcement that the government is considering one more stimulus package. This will definitely generate interest among the investors. Besides  the government in its recent budget also has given 100% exemptions of passive income of the sovereign wealth funds from investments in infrastructure and specified sectors.  If this meeting translates into investments  it will augur well for the infrastructure sector in specific and the economy as a whole.”  Vijayasarathy added: “Better times appear to be round the corner because of the resumption of economic activities and Covid-19 vaccine trials moving into a third phase.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/pm-modi-to-preside-over-virtual-global-investor-roundtable-on-nov-5/story-oixhqIpkyOV8iG5EW1hjvJ.html

In a circular released on November 1  BCI has stated that its original decision was passed believing that Covid-19 pandemic will subside soon. “However  the pandemic still persists and therefore  the council has resolved that examinations of all intermediary along with final year exams maybe held online if universities/colleges are able to do so ” it stated. It added that in case of students who cannot appear or pass the exam due to any problem  they be given a chance to do so within a month of the physical reopening of colleges. In May and June  BCI had released a circular stating that second and fourth semester students pursuing the three-year LLB course should be promoted based on a physical examination conducted within a month of the colleges reopening. However  all Maharashtra state universities have already promoted all students  except final year students  based on their previous semester performance.  “The circular BCI released in May had clear directions that examinations of all students  except final year students  should be conducted within one month of reopening of colleges. Despite such clear directions  universities across Maharashtra decided to declare results of second and fourth year students without conducting physical exams ” said a statement released by Student Law Council  a state-based student group. “Our concern was whether the promotion certificates approved by the state universities will be accepted and considered valid by the BCI in the future. This new circular has brought clarity and now the state universities need to accept the same ” said Sachin Pawar  president of the group.

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,Mizoram hands over body of Assam resident  national highway blockade continues,The national highway has been blocked by Assam residents since October 28 demanding withdrawal of Mizoram security personnel from the border areas.,Amid continued tension along border areas between the two states  the Mizoram government on Tuesday handed over the body of an Assam resident who had died in police custody in the neighbouring state a day earlier.  A large posse of Mizoram security personnel accompanied the body of Intazul Laskar and handed it over to senior district and police officials of Cachar district in Assam at Lailapur on the border between the two states. Laskar’s brother was also present during the handing over.  The Assam government maintains the 45-year-ol Laskar was abducted from its territory on Sunday while Mizoram claims he was a drug dealer and had entered the state to smuggle in narcotics. “Nearly 250-300 security personnel from Mizoram accompanied the body of the deceased and handed it over to us at 10:30 am. We are conducting a magisterial inquest and post-mortem to ascertain the exact cause of death ” Dilip Kumar Dey  deputy inspector general of police  (Southern Range)  Assam Police  said.  The body was handed over to the deceased’s family on Tuesday evening for the last rites.  The Assam Police have registered a case of abduction at Dholai police station and are conducting an investigation.  “The situation on the border areas is tense but under control. Blockade of NH 306 connecting Mizoram by residents of Lailapur continues. Residents on the Assam side are very angry at Laskar’s death ” Dey said.  The national highway has been blocked by Assam residents since October 28 demanding withdrawal of Mizoram security personnel from the border areas.  A case of unnatural death has also been lodged by Mizoram Police and a magisterial inquiry ordered in connection with Laskar’s death.  “On November 1  Intyaz Ali aka Intazul Laskar was apprehended by volunteers of the Young Mizo Association while he was trying to sell drugs. While attempting to flee  he suffered injuries on his ankles. Later  excise officials seized 420 mg from him and arrested him ” ANI quoted Mizoram’s inspector general of police (IGP) John Neihlaia as saying..  “As this is death in custody  post mortem was done as per NHRC guidelines. A case of unnatural death has been registered and a magisterial inquiry also being held. The body was handed over to his (Laskar’s brother) ” he added.  The Mizoram police official maintained that Laskar was weak and died at Vairengte community health centre on November 2.  On Tuesday  newly appointed Assam chief secretary Jishnu Barua and Assam’s director general of police (DGP) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta visited the border areas to take stock of the situation. They also met Laskar’s family and handed over a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as ex-gratia.  “We will take all measures needed to protect our residents and ensure Assam’s territory is not encroached upon. Talks are on at the highest level to resolve the issue. Unlike Mizoram  we don’t want to indulge in uncivil behaviour  but will not tolerate injustice ” Mahanta told journalists.  While Assam maintains that troops from Mizoram have encroached parts of its territory  the Mizoram side claims the areas belong to them and have refused to call back its troops till normalcy returns.  Last month  several people on both sides of the border between two states were injured in clashes after some miscreants from Mizoram allegedly burnt down some huts at Lailapur.  Assam and Mizoram share a 165 km boundary. There have been skirmishes on both sides earlier as well as both sides claiming portions of land along the boundary as theirs.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-hands-over-body-of-assam-resident-national-highway-blockade-continues/story-OppI0pg5ZxKbzcCfiMPZ7K.html

Protesters associated with the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti -- which began the movement for reservation in Bayana on Sunday saying the community comes under the Most Backward Class (MBC) -- blocked the Delhi-Mumbai rail route  leading to several trains being diverted. The Kota rail division officials said 17 passenger trains and 25 goods trains were diverted. On Monday  internet services were suspended across Bharatpur and Karauli district  and in nine tehsils of Jaipur districts.  Gurjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla said the agitation will continue until their demands are met. Speaking to news agency ANI  Bainsla said  “The government should accept our demands as early as possible.” On Tuesday evening  senior IAS officer Niraj K Pavan reached Bayana to hold talks with Bainsla.   Vijay Bainsla  Kirori Singh Bainsla’s son  said they are ready to hold talks with any government authority. “However  the talks will take place only on the railway tracks and not in any room ” he said.  Meanwhile  additional director general of police (law and order) Saurabh Srivastava said additional forces have been deployed in Kota Rural  Tonk  Bundi and Jhalawar where members of the Gurjar community attempted to block roads.

04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,,Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to lead protest at Rajghat,Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh announced a relay protest of Congress lawmakers at Rajghat on Wednesday after President Ram Nath Kovind refused to meet a delegation led by him over the Centre’s controversial new farm laws and the northern state’s rapidly worsening power crisis.,Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh announced a relay protest of Congress lawmakers at Rajghat on Wednesday after President Ram Nath Kovind refused to meet a delegation led by him over the Centre’s controversial new farm laws and the northern state’s rapidly worsening power crisis.   The chief minister’s office (CMO) on October 21 sought an appointment with the President on November 4 to urge him to grant his assent to Punjab’s farm bills passed last month by the state assembly in a bid to bypass the Centre’s new laws that ushered in reform in the agricultural sector but also sparked widespread protests in the state. But Rashtrapati Bhavan declined the appointment on Monday  pointing out that the state farm bills were still pending with the governor. The CMO sent another request the same day  but the President’s office declined this as well  saying it “cannot be accepted at this juncture for reasons cited earlier”. In response  Singh announced on Tuesday that  he will lead a dharna to highlight the “power crisis and critical essential supplies situation”. The CM said as section 144 of the CrPC -- which prohibits assembly of people -- is in force in the Capital  MLAs will go from Delhi’s Punjab Bhawan to Mahatma Gandhi’s  final resting place in Rajghat  in groups of four to hold a relay protest. Singh will lead the first batch at 10.30 am. Singh also asked legislators of other parties to join the dharna in the interest of the state.  The CM said the protest in Delhi will also highlight the power crisis and scarcity of essential supplies in the state due to the suspension of goods trains by the Centre. The Railways stopped running trains to Punjab from October 1  saying farmers protesting against the farm laws blocked tracks and attacked trains  leading to losses. But the state government says it has eased the blockade and allowed goods trains to run. “GVK has announced it will close down operations at 3pm on Tuesday since coal stocks have completely run out. The public and private power plants in the state have already shut down ” the CM said in a statement. On October 20  Punjab’s assembly unanimously passed four bills and a resolution to counter the three agriculture marketing laws enacted by the Centre in September  and pledged to safeguard the interests of the state’s farmers  who are concerned that the central legislation would deprive them of government-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs) for their produce and put them at the mercy of big agribusinesses. Because the state laws are in conflict with the central laws  which have been signed by Kovind  they require presidential assent to be enacted. Some farmers organisations say the bills offer nothing substantial. BJP’s state general secretary Subhash Sharma said Singh should stop political maneuvering. “The railways have requ-ested the Punjab government to get the train tracks vacated and he should ensure this as law and order is his responsibility. Who will be responsible if some mishap occurs?

The agriculture ministry is also undertaking a massive drive to publicise the three controversial laws that have led to protests by farmers groups in some states. “Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has written to over 200 000 sarpanches (village heads) in multiple languages to spell out the various provisions of the laws and the benefits to farmers from the reforms ” the official cited above said.  The agriculture ministry has marshalled over 100 resource persons from central and state governments to educate farmers on the three Acts that bring the full force of liberalisation to the agriculture sector. These resource persons attended a training session last month  the official said.  He added that the price information and market intelligence system will be a web-based platform and will collate real-time data of production  arrivals of farm produce in markets  and demand and supply  to provide a profitable indicative price to farmers. The system will also have a mechanism to easily disseminate the price information to growers to help them negotiate better returns  possibly delivered on mobile handsets.  “For farmers  price has always been the real issue. Regardless of whatever system one has  the government will ultimately have to intervene to make good losses through procurement whenever there is a price crash ” said RK Mani  an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The NDA government on September 24 passed three bills -- the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill  2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance  Farm Services Bill  2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 – despite protests by farmers’ outfits and opposition leaders.  The reforms allow agribusiness to freely trade farm produce  permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. A crucial change is that traders  agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market  rather than buy only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate.  These rules have angered farmers  particularly in Punjab  who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system  which offers growers an assured price  leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.  PM Narendra Modi has said  on several occasions  that the three laws have no bearing on the current system of assured prices  which will continue. But the Opposition has questioned why this has not been made explicit in the new laws. Three Congress-ruled states -- Punjab  Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan -- have passed their own farm laws to override the Central provisions. These  however  may yet be open to legal  interpretation,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-price-info-system-for-farmers/story-82KncexBluzC9Hb0NdVdXN.html
04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,States granted Rs 2 200 crore to fight air pollution,The Union government approved the release of ₹2 200 crore to fight air pollution to 42 cities with a population in excess of a million -- money that will be used under the National Clean Air Programme to improve air quality in these cities.,The Union government approved the release of ₹2 200 crore to fight air pollution to 42 cities with a population in excess of a million -- money that will be used under the National Clean Air Programme to improve air quality in these cities. The money (transferred through states) will go towards  capacity building of the local urban bodies and  state pollution control boards. Delhi  with the worst air in the country   is not among  the cities that will receive funds under this grant. While Delhi is among the 102 cities covered by NCAP  it has not received any funding under NCAP.  Greater Mumbai has received  the highest share of funds   ₹244 crore followed by Kolkata (₹192 crores)  Bengaluru (₹139.5 crore) and Chennai (₹90 crore).  A  November 2 communication from the Finance Commission Division to the accounts officer at the Chief Controller of Accounts in the department of expenditure  ministry of finance details the allocation. The 2020-21 report of the finance commission had recommended the grant of ₹4 400 crore to NCAP. The programme  launched in January last year  aims to reduce by 20-30%  the  PM 2.5 (respirable  pollution particles) concentrations  in over a hundred cities compared to 2017 levels. The report released last November also explained Delhi’s exclusion. “We are also deeply concerned with the issue of  ‘ease of breathing’ in the National Capital Region (NCR)  especially the extremely hazardous levels of pollution in October-November of each year. One of the main reasons for this is the burning of crop residue in the surrounding states of Haryana  Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. We are unable to make an allocation to address this as Delhi is not a state. Besides  the pollution hazard in the NCR is very unique as the air-shed contributing to pollution extends to three neighbouring states ” the Commission noted in the report  adding that  it is “ therefore recommended that the Union Government constitute a high power committee  consisting of the ministries of Finance  Environment  Forest and Climate Change and Agriculture and Farmer Welfare  the Governments of Haryana  Punjab and Uttar Pradesh  to devise  implement and monitor a time-bound action plan for pollution mitigation under the National Clean Air Programme.” The state governments are supposed to directly transfer the grants to city administrations within 10 days of receipt. Any delay would mean that state will have to release the funds with interest. Finance Minister  Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted on  Tuesday:  “The government  based on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission has released ₹2 200 crores as the first instalments to 15 states for the improvement of air quality measures in their million plus cities. ”  The 15th Finance Commission report specifies that the environment ministry in consultation with states will develop a city-wise and year wise targets for ambient air quality based on annual average concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 ; and  monitor and evaluate improvement and recommend disbursal of grants accordingly to cities. “The second instalment shall be disbursed against the stipulated performance-based outcomes in terms of year-on-year improvement in air quality in January 2021 ” the report states. But MoEFCC is yet to come out with benchmarks for monitoring of use of funds and improvement in air quality; the deadline for this was April. “MoEFCC is in the final stages of formulating a framework for monitoring the use of funds. In fact  Central Pollution Control Board is developing the framework with the state governments. The Finance Commission report is very clear that the second instalment of the funds will be performance based. Delhi is not included in the list because it is a union territory. Finance Commission doesn’t provide these funds to UTs ” a senior environment ministry official said. Experts are concerned about how these substantial grants will be utilised. “The Finance Commission grants represent an important step forward. The allocations are substantial... ” said Santosh Harish  fellow at Centre for Policy Research.  “There will be some challenges this year... Unfortunately  except for a few cities like Patna  most city action plans don’t yet lend themselves well for this effort. Some grantee cities like Chennai are not part of NCAP and therefore may be less prepared. There are some other sources of uncertainty as well. To what extent can polluting activities outside the direct jurisdiction of the urban local bodies be targeted through these grants?”. A Delhi government spokesperson said  “Centre’s decision to not give any funds to Delhi from ₹2 200 Cr... shows its pettiness and complete lack of political will when it comes to the problem of pollution in Delhi. Pollution is a health emergency for the entire of north India and it knows no boundaries.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-granted-rs-2-200-cr-to-fight-air-pollution/story-IcYI7rJHGinV9OzW5Nt70N.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,,PIL in medical bribery scam: NGO pays Rs 25 lakh fine asked by Supreme Court,The NGO while depositing the demand draft of Rs 25 lakh said that it wanted the money to be utilized by the Supreme Court Bar Association Welfare Fund to help lawyers affected by the pandemic.,After being slapped with a hefty fine of Rs 25 lakh in December 2017 by the top court for filing a PIL demanding judicial probe into a medical college bribery scam involving a sitting Orissa high court judge  the NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform (CJAR) deposited the amount with the court making a parallel request to recall the order imposing cost. The application moved by CJAR will come up before a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar on Wednesday. The NGO while depositing the demand draft of Rs 25 lakh said that it wanted the money to be utilized by the Supreme Court Bar Association Welfare Fund to help lawyers affected by the pandemic.  At the same time  it pointed out that the December 1  2017 order dismissing the PIL filed by the NGO as “frivolous” proved to be wrong subsequently. Explaining the delay to deposit the amount  the NGO said that the working committee (of CJAR) felt that despite lack of funds  the SC Bar Association Welfare Fund was currently in need of funds to help advocates who have suffered due to lack of work during the pandemic and hence decided to deposit the cost “despite the unfairness of it”.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-in-medical-bribery-scam-ngo-pays-rs-25-lakh-fine-asked-by-supreme-court/story-oW58YmHKd4YmIagEa0UlmN.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,,Job woes abound in migrant hub,As part of the Union government’s relief programme  every migrant worker’s family gets 5 kg free foodgrain per head and maximum of 25 kg per family besides they got Rs 1000 under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana.,“We have to deliver every day unlike those who are in government jobs”  Chandan Paswan  30   waiting  for someone to hire him for a day said. A resident of Dilarpur village in Katihar  Chandan returned from Delhi  (in May) by a special train after the national lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease was enforced in late March. Madho Rishi  50  of Nakkipur village  came back from Ludhiana by special train . “I am waiting for someone to hire me” he said   looking at this scribe with hope. “Yes  I can do all kinds of manual work” Yogi Mandal  55 of Kolasi said  requesting  just one chance. “Give me just one chance  I can assure you that I will never disappoint you.” All three  and many like them are at Katihar’s Mirchaibaribari Chowk also known as Labour Chowk on the Katihar-Purnia Road. Some walk to the spot; others cycle. “Our morning starts at 4 am every day and we reach here latest by 7 am covering 25 by cycle for a daylong job” said one of the workers. “Many  days we have to return without a job.” Mostly unskilled  the workers charge anything between rs 250 and Rs 400 a day.  There are at least 12 such points in Katihar town areas  but the Mirchaibari labour Chowk  is the oldest  and also the most popular. Around 200-300 workers gather here everyday.  “We hardly get work for 10 to 15 days in a month” now  said Anil Oraon  32  from  Modhra village  adding that this is probably because of the ongoing pandemic. He is happy that the state is proving them with free rations though. “We are alive because we get free ration” he said.  As part of the Union government’s relief programme  every migrant worker’s family gets 5 kg free foodgrain per head and maximum of 25 kg per family besides they got Rs 1000 under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana. Besides  government also launched a job programme  Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan for migrants to offer them works under 25 schemes worth Rs 50 000 crore.  The scheme was originally launched for three months and then extended till November. Gulab Chandra Chouhan  45  a resident of Para village says free rations can’t help them lead a dignified life. He wants work  but thinks the pandemic   not the government  is to blame.  Md Ibrahim  50  adds:  “Elections can’t solve our problem; what can solve our problem is work.” Katihar has the maximum number of migrant workers who returned from other regions during the  national lockdown.  About 4 00 000 migrant workers returned to the region by trains and other means of transport; many have since returned to the big cities  bused away by contractors over the past few months.  All told  around 2.5 million migrant workers returned to Bihar in the wake of the pandemic.  Naresh Kumar Srivasatava  a political worker and a professor at Purnia University  said  that “nobody can rule out the fact that the Central government has done a lot during the pandemic.” Katihar will go to the polls on November 7.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/job-woes-abound-in-migrant-hub/story-eHcYwkydEOBJaN3HmBhmTK.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Rahul Gandhi targets PM Modi  Bihar CM Nitish Kumar over ‘poor development’ in state,Rahul Gandhi blamed PM Modi and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for growing unemployment in Bihar  saying workers who returned to the state in distress during the Covid-19 lockdown wouldn’t have had to go outside the state to earn a living in the first place had the two leaders kept their promise to create jobs.,Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for growing unemployment in Bihar  saying workers who returned to the state in distress during the Covid-19 lockdown wouldn’t have had to go outside the state to earn a living in the first place had the two leaders kept their promise to create jobs. At an election meeting at Korha in Katihar ahead of the third phase of polling in the Bihar assembly elections on November 7  Gandhi pledged that the state government would work for a permanent solution to recurring floods in Bihar and facilitate the setting up of food processing units in the region  considered the maize bowl of Bihar  if the Grand Alliance of the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal is voted to power. Farmers and labourers of this region  which accounts for  20% of maize production in the country  had been forced to migrate for jobs because the state and  the central governments had failed to ensure that farm produce received profitable returns  Gandhi said. At Kishanganj  the Congress leader took a potshot over the Bihar CM’s act to intimidate the youngsters asking for jobs at his rallies and said that Nitish Kumar should not rebuke them. “They (youngsters) are asking genuine question. He (CM) should acknowledge that he had lied to them. The biggest question India is grappling with is how to provide jobs to the youth ” asked Rahul Gandhi. JDU spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi’s attack on the government for unemployment basically was a reflection of the GA’s desperation. “No one takes the Congress leader seriously after the 58-years of misrule by the Congress and later by RJD  which pushed Bihar in the distress.”  State BJP general secretary Devesh Kumar said  “People in the state are scared at the hint of jungle raj regime and unfeasible promises would anyway help the GA to get better this time.”,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-targets-pm-modi-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-over-poor-development-in-state/story-C5oEh15mNI3McqA9BdNRnN.html
04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india;united states,CBI asks US for info on convicted NRIs,The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has asked the US department of justice (DOJ) to provide information and documentation on Indians who commit crimes on American soil and are prosecuted there  particularly those who plead guilty in economic and cyber crimes.,New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has asked United States’ Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide information and documents on Indian nationals  who commit crime on American soil and are prosecuted there  particularly the ones who plead guilty in economic and cyber crimes  so that their Indian links can be explored by law enforcement agencies in India  people familiar with the development said.  Cases of Indian nationals being involved in duping American citizens  or running unfair online practices being probed by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or local authorities in the US have come to notice lately which are being closely watched by Indian agencies.  Indictment of six persons including an Indian national – Nishad Kunju (31) from Hyderabad by a US grand jury in September this year for conspiring to pay over $100 000 in commercial bribes to employees and contractors of Amazon is the latest instance where CBI and other agencies want to explore the Indian aspect.  Another Indian national – Chirag Sachdeva pleaded guilty last month to the charges of participating in a telemarketing scheme to try to embezzle about $600 000 from seven elderly people in America. He was arrested by the FBI in February. In similar case  one Sudhish Kasaba Ramesh from India pleaded guilty earlier this year in the federal court in San Jose  California for intentionally accessing the protected computer of an information technology firm.  Indian agencies feel there are many more such cases of online frauds or cyber crimes where Indian citizens  based in the US  are involved and there is possibility they park their illegal money in India  or have associates here  which needs further scrutiny  people cited above said.  A senior DOJ official last week attended the three-day national conference on vigilance and corruption organized by the CBI  where the issue was taken up  said an officer who didn’t want to be named.  “We have asked DOJ to provide the all the relevant documents on Indians arrested/convicted there ” said second officer.  Lately  there has been enhanced cooperation between CBI and the DOJ. In fact  DOJ praised the premier anti-corruption probe agency earlier this month for conducting raids on six companies here in India as part of a parallel investigation in a technical support fraud scam masterminded by an American citizen working with various call centres here.  Both the authorities are also informally collaborating on matters like investigation against Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya  who have investments in the US.  Sherbir Panag  Partner at Panag and Babu and international legal expert on white collar crimes  said – “Indian authorities understand that the only way they are likely to receive cooperation from their foreign counterparts  is being proactive themselves to enforcement and information requests. With the Internet fraud too has become globalised - one such example being the call centre’s in Mumbai/Ahmedabad that were defrauding US companies and authorities by impersonation. It is a step in the right direction for Indian authorities to investigate the use of Indian soil for misdeeds outside the country.”  During the three-day conference  attended by over 600 officers from all the states and union territories  the agencies and senior government representatives also discussed the increasing role of informal channel like direct cooperation between police and agencies of various countries in gathering information; and the role of Interpol.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-asks-us-for-info-on-convicted-nris/story-MsX6GVsEVbTvVJyJtQbzTM.html

The 89th General Assembly of all 194-member countries of Interpol was to discuss cooperation in tackling terrorism  organised crime and criminal networks  among other aspects of policing. Interpol’s executive committee concluded that it is inadvisable and materially impossible to hold the GA anywhere in the world this year. “Due to legal  technical and logistical reasons  there is currently also no viable option for a virtual GA ” Interpol said in a statement. Interpol secretary general Jürgen Stock said: “The UAE authorities worked extremely hard to identify solutions to the problems presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. However  unfortunately it is not possible for the GA to go ahead as planned”.  New dates for GA have not yet been announced. India is due to host the 91st GA of Interpol in 2022.  It is yet to be ascertained if the postponement of this year’s GA will affect future annual meetings.  The postponement implies that besides the budget  which exceptionally can be approved by the executive committee  all other statutory items would remain pending until the next session of GA  Interpol said.  This includes elections to the executive committee and  Commission for the Control (CCC) of Interpol’s files. The CCC decides cases of red notices after analysing presentations made by fugitives.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interpol-defers-its-general-assembly/story-YyxHIWsZ3ZhkocnwC3YB5O.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Active Covid-19 cases declining  but surge in four states: Govt,Even as active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are declining in the country  at least four states -- Manipur  Delhi  Kerala  and West Bengal -- are reporting a surge in the viral infection  the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.,Even as active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are declining in the country  at least four states -- Manipur  Delhi  Kerala  and West Bengal -- are reporting a surge in the viral infection  the Union health ministry said on Tuesday. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan  citing data from the ministry  said that in Manipur  the number of active cases has gone up to 3 500 from 2 000 cases reported earlier  while Delhi saw a jump from 26 000 to 53 000 cases. “Kerala had reported 77 000 active cases earlier  which now stands at 86 000  and West Bengal saw an increase from 26 000 to 36 000 in the past week ” said Bhushan during a press conference. The health ministry is in constant touch with these states to ensure improved implementation of Covid-19 containment measures  he said. “It doesn’t matter whether numbers are going up or coming down  the strategy of test  track  trace and treat has to be universally followed. This strategy will not go out of fashion  and our primary focus should be to increase and enhance this  at least till the time we achieve case positivity rate of 5% or below ” said Bhushan  also cautioning that with more festivals coming up in the next few weeks  states should avoid a surge in infections during the festive season. According to the health ministry data  India has 541 000 active cases of Covid-19  which is about 6.8% of the total cases of the disease reported in the country. A major reason for active Covid-19 cases decreasing significantly was due to increased recoveries in the past five months  ministry officials said. The data shows that there were about 95 000 recoveries reported in June  which has now gone up to 7.6 million. “These figures are important as these show that our health care infrastructure is not overburdened due to Covid-19 because these active cases either land up at hospitals or spend time in home isolation. Medical monitoring is needed even for those under home isolation ” said Bhushan. When there were around a million active cases in mid-September  there was extra load on health care delivery system in the country.  Some of the major states that have reported a significant decline in active cases in the month of November  as compared to October  are Maharashtra with 119 000 active cases this month from October’s 261 000. Karnataka has also seen great improvements too  with the 112 000 active cases reported in October declining to 44 000 in November. Andhra Pradesh saw a drop from 56 000 to 22 000 active cases  as did Tamil Nadu that saw a decline from 46 000 to 19 000 cases. In Uttar Pradesh  there were 49 000 active cases last month that has now come down to 23 000.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-covid-19-cases-declining-but-surge-in-four-states-govt/story-mNRkhiV1sclcVeC0ctSVKL.html
04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,france;india;china;pakistan,Three new Rafale jets to arrive today,The second batch of the Indian Air Force’s three Rafale fighter jets will arrive at the Jamnagar airbase in Gujarat directly from France on Wednesday as the air force prepares to form its first Rafale squadron at Ambala  officials familiar with the developments said.,The second batch of the Indian Air Force’s three Rafale fighter jets will arrive at the Jamnagar airbase in Gujarat directly from France on Wednesday as the air force prepares to form its first Rafale squadron at Ambala  officials familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.  The first batch of five Rafale jets of the 36 ordered by the IAF reached the Ambala airbase on July 29 after a stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi  although a formal induction ceremony took place later on September 10.  “The three jets will not have a stopover on their way. They will be refueled by French and Indian tankers during the journey. The jets are expected to reach Ambala after a one-day break at Jamnagar ” the officials said.  An Indian Air Force team  led by a two-star officer  was in France last month to review the progress of the Rafale project ahead of the arrival of the second batch of fighters  as reported by Hindustan Times on October 16. The arrival of more fighters will further boost the IAF’s capability to rapidly deploy the advanced jets amid tensions with neighbouring China and Pakistan  the officials said.  The IAF is expecting three to four Rafale jets being delivered every two months  with all the 36 planes likely to join the air force’s combat fleet by the year-end.  The Rafale fighters — the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997 — have significantly enhanced the offensive capabilities of the IAF.  The IAF is operating the Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert to deal with any provocation by China at a time when talks have failed to reduce friction in the sensitive theatre.  IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria last month said the integration of Rafale fighter jets brought in a platform armed with advanced weapons  sensors and technologies that gave the IAF an operational and technological edge.  The jets were ordered from France in September 2016 under a government-to-government deal worth ₹59 000 crore. India-specific enhancements on the Rafales include a helmet-mounted sight  radar warning receivers  flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data  infrared search and track systems  jammers  cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.  The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack  air defence and air superiority  reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-new-rafale-jets-to-arrive-today/story-8orXQXOXMaYAdm7LsOaZjJ.html
04/11/2020,government,Hindustan Times,India,india,Vista revamp will preserve heritage buildings: Centre tells SC,The Centre on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that the Central Vista Redevelopment Project  which involves construction of a new Parliament building and a Central Secretariat housing all government offices  will “protect and preserve” heritage buildings while keeping with the laws and environmental safeguards.,The Centre on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that the Central Vista Redevelopment Project  which involves construction of a new Parliament building and a Central Secretariat housing all government offices  will “protect and preserve” heritage buildings while keeping with the laws and environmental safeguards. Making opening arguments on a batch of public interest litigations (PIL) challenging clearances related to the project  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought to put at rest apprehensions that the project will destroy heritage buildings and alter the landscape of the area. Appearing for the Centre  Mehta said  “The petitioner’s arguments on heritage structure proceeds on a deliberately misunderstood factual position that heritage buildings are being demolished and a new project as “greenfield project” is coming up...The petitioner has purposefully misunderstood the ambit and scope of consultancy contract and presented a false picture that the respondents (Centre and statutory agencies) have abdicated its functioning to a private consultant.” “Heritage buildings will not be destroyed. The stress on them will be reduced by shifting out government offices from them into the newly planned Central Secretariat building ” he said. Mehta said the Parliament and common Central Secretariat projects are not integrated but mutually exclusive. “The construction of one does not depend on the other. The year 2022 coincides with the 75th year of India’s Independence by when the new Parliament building is sought to be completed. This was the urgency for beginning with the Parliament project.” The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar  Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjeev Khanna said  “The petitioners have argued that these plans that you prepared were not in public domain. The whole argument is built on the ground that nothing about the project is available in public domain.”  Mehta said much of the information that he has shared with the court was available on government websites. The bench asked Mehta to give a list of such information available for public consumption on government websites. The bench asked Mehta about the need for undertaking a study  assessing the option of building a new Parliament as against refurbishing the existing Parliament.  Mehta replied  “For us to decide that a new Parliament building is needed  we do not need a separate study.” He compared it by saying  “If feel the house I am living in is not acceptable  do I really need an expert to determine that?”  On the allegation that the project will be a drain on public exchequer  the Centre said the government was paying a huge rent to maintain its offices in different buildings. In most buildings  office space was lying unused and commuting between these was proving to be a costly and time-consuming affair.  The rent saved will work out to be roughly ₹1 000 crore annually  Mehta said  adding  “This will be a cost-saving project.”  The petitions challenging the project have been filed by one Rajeev Suri and former Armyman Anuj Srivastava and others.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vista-revamp-will-preserve-heritage-buildings-centre-tells-sc/story-CB2jmlRmKREAR9tFigiX5J.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus,Hindustan Times,India,india,Supreme Court panel to set virtual hearing benchmarks,The Supreme Court’s e-committee has set up a panel that will focus on setting benchmarks and standards for digitising courts and providing virtual interface to litigants through videoconferencing and live streaming  its (the e-committee’s) chairman justice DY Chandrachud said.,The Supreme Court’s e-committee has set up a panel that will focus on setting benchmarks and standards for digitising courts and providing virtual interface to litigants through videoconferencing and live streaming  its (the e-committee’s) chairman justice DY Chandrachud said.  This panel will recommend rules  requirement of digital infrastructure  and budgetary allocation for implementing the projects  he added. As a first step  the panel  with the help of experts  has framed Model Rules for Videoconferencing for the benefit of high courts that are yet to frame Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to conduct courts through videoconferencing. At present  most high courts function through videoconferencing on a host of videoconferencing apps available in the public domain. The Supreme Court itself uses Vidyo while high courts prefer Zoom  Cisco Webex  Google Meet  or Jitsi  besides Vidyo. Justice Chandrachud  the chairman of the Supreme Court e-committee  said: “I have formed a broad-based committee that has already framed model rules for videoconferencing. The committee is also looking into live streaming and digitization and to have a National Best Practices Standards in this regard for the entire judiciary.” He added that while this committee has not reached the stage of framing rules for live streaming  where the Gujarat high court has taken the lead.  “What the Gujarat High Court has done is to put its content on YouTube. That is an option which is available but the committee is looking at storing the data. It will be systematically done and not as an ad hoc approach.” The panel he has set up will be exploring the infrastructure required for live streaming and storage of data  technical standards  cost involved and other requirements. “The exercise is going on and there is no time frame fixed. How the data is to be stored and who should access it are questions that need to be gone into ” justice Chandrachud said.  The composition of the broad-based committee is not known  but it includes domain experts. On October 26  during suo moto proceedings on framing of guidelines for the courts during Covid-19  Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde sounded a note of caution on live streaming. “In principle  I agree that there should be live streaming but in practice  there can be negative use or abuse of live streaming ” he said. The CJI referred to a host of complaints he has to routinely deal with on virtual court proceedings held through videoconferencing. The seeds for live streaming were planted by the Supreme Court itself in a landmark judgment in September 2018 where the Court gave the necessary go-ahead for it in matters of national and constitutional importance that impact the public at large. This was the first step towards opening up courts as the three-judge bench in that decision (justice Chandrachud was a member) held: “Sunlight is the best disinfectant”. Attorney General KK Venugopal on October 26 suggested to a bench headed by CJI SA Bobde that the Supreme Court should follow the example of the Gujarat high court. He also referred to the 2018 judgement.  In September this year  a Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted a report suggesting permanent virtual proceedings not only for courts but for tribunals in certain category of cases. Coining the benefits of digital justice as “cheaper and faster”  the Rajya Sabha panel chaired by BJP lawmaker Bhupendra Yadav said in its interim report: “This (virtual courts) will cut down the cost and increase efficiency in disposal of cases without unnecessarily being adjourned. Virtual courts can deliver faster results with fewer resources. They can also reduce commute time to courts and waiting time.” The Supreme Court has been conducting court hearings through videoconferencing since March. Though demands to resume physical court hearings have been raised by lawyer bodies  this has not been considered feasible in view of the growing number of coronavirus disease cases.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-panel-to-set-virtual-hearing-benchmarks/story-iTT98hnrjkPVwjJXrmKEFP.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;government,Hindustan Times,India,australia;france;india;new zealand,Covid-19: What you need to know today,By the end of October  we were supposed to have at least some data from the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine’s Phase 3 trials.,By the end of October  we were supposed to have at least some data from the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine’s Phase 3 trials. That’s been delayed (not by much  according to some reports) even as it is increasingly becoming clear that the timelines most of us (and this includes executives in Big Pharma  government officials  health care experts  analysts  and journalists) have in mind for the availability of the first Covid-19 vaccines are far too aggressive  perhaps even impossible.  It could well turn out that I am wrong – it’s happened before – but many experts agree that a mid-2021 timeline for the vaccine is more realistic. Then there is the question of capacity and availability  and the challenges of distributing a vaccine. And at least for the first vaccines that will be available  there’s a very high likelihood that people who are fortunate enough to get a shot early will need a second shot before everyone in the world has had their first. Which brings us to the question I have been leading up to: What’s Plan B? Last Wednesday (October 28)  provided one answer (actually  to my mind  the only one). That day  the Australian city of Melbourne emerged from a lockdown that lasted 112 days. It was a lockdown that involved shelter-in-place rules; closure of most stores  restaurants  and gyms; bar on social gatherings  indoor and outdoor  including weddings; and out-of-city travel restrictions (people couldn’t travel beyond 5km of their homes).  Other parts of the state of Victoria also saw lockdowns  but none as stringent as Melbourne. The city’s hard lockdown (which was progressively eased) was controversial   but  imposed in the wake of a second wave of cases in Melbourne and Victoria  it was successful  with the number of cases going down to zero by last week. It isn’t just Australia which has depended on lockdowns to crush the virus; its neighbour New Zealand has  too  in what its recently re-elected Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern terms the country’s “go hard  go early” strategy. With most European nations now imposing stringent lockdowns – France’s is near total – to cope with a near-debilitating second wave of the pandemic  more people are beginning to look to the Australian and New Zealand approach (sure  it helps that both are relatively remote  sparsely populated  and islands). Not too long ago  many of these leaders wouldn’t even consider a second lockdown. The UK’s Boris Johnson  for instance  said a second lockdown in the country would be “disastrous”  especially in terms of its impact on the economy; over the weekend  he announced a stringent four-week one as it became clear that the country’s health system was within weeks of being drowned in cases. Interestingly  schools  even in France and the UK – both countries are seeing far more cases in the second round than they did in the first; the seven-day average of new cases in France is 43 000  around 10 times what it was during the peak of the first wave; in the UK  it is 22 000  around four times -- will remain open during the lockdown. And when Melbourne started easing restrictions  schools were among the first things it opened. Research conducted in several countries shows that in regions where there is no community transmission (or limited community transmission  a term preferred by India’s health ministry)  it is alright to open schools  especially for young children (this would mean primary and middle school) because they are unlikely to spread the virus. It is older children who are more vulnerable  and could also end up transmitting the virus more. But I digress; the debate over whether or not schools are safe could fill an entire edition of Hindustan Times. The only viable Plan B  the only way to manage a sharp spike in cases that comes with a new wave of the pandemic  is a lockdown. No one likes lockdowns  but they seem to work.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-i9U72m4wdHGyD9qosNAHgL.html
04/11/2020,coronavirus;technology,Hindustan Times,India,india,India gets through biggest poll day in Covid-19 shadow,Roughly 15 million people voted in 94 constituencies across 17 districts of Bihar in the biggest phase of the assembly elections on Tuesday with a provisional turnout of 54.44%  marking a tough day for election officials who worked round-the-clock to ward off the Covid-19 threat.,Roughly 15 million people voted in 94 constituencies across 17 districts of Bihar in the biggest phase of the assembly elections on Tuesday with a provisional turnout of 54.44%  marking a tough day for election officials who worked round-the-clock to ward off the Covid-19 threat. Assembly bypolls for 54 seats in 10 seats also passed off peacefully  and the voting percentage ranged from a low of 53% in Uttar Pradesh to a high of 87%in Nagaland. The most crucial among the bypolls is in Madhya Pradesh  where 28 seats are up for grabs in the 230-member assembly. In Bihar  the provisional turnout was 1.73 percentage points less than the 2015 assembly polls (56.17%) in these constituencies. It was also lower than the first phase (55.69%) in 71 constituencies on October 28.  To be sure  polling numbers are usually revised upwards the day after polling  and Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) HR Srinivasa said he expected the final voter count to go up by Wednesday because the final vote count in 13 constituencies was yet to come. “The electoral exercise going on in the country is by far the largest exercise in the world amid the pandemic...the voter turnout in the first phase has been exceptionally good. The voter turnout has further continued and the confidence level has been much more in this phase ” Election Commission (EC) secretary general Umesh Sinha said. State capital Patna recorded the lowest voter turnout at 48.23%. Patna’s Digha constituency  the largest assembly segment in terms of electorate (450 000)  recorded the lowest voter turnout at 34.5%  followed by Bankipur at 35.9% and Kumhrar at 36.4%. Muzaffarpur district topped with the highest provisional turnout of 59.98%  followed by West Champaran at 59.69%  and Begusarai at 58.82%  according to information shared by the chief electoral officer.  The polls sealed the fate of top Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders  Tejashwi Yadav and his brother Tej Pratap Yadav  as well as four sitting ministers. In all  1 463 candidates were in the fray. Voting was largely peaceful  barring isolated instances of stone-pelting and clashes in Saran and Muzaffarpur. An electronic voting machine (EVM) was broken by a young manin Saran. Police detained as many as 62 people across the state and seized 726 illegal firearms.  Srinivasa said 152 control units  219 ballot units and 540 VVPAT (voter verification audit trail) were changed following snags. A total 50 115 control units  73 210 ballot units and 53 853 VVPAT were used during the second phase  he added. Polling began at 7am  but the time for conclusion was extended by one hour till 6pm to facilitate Covid-19 patients and those with symptoms to exercise their franchise during the final hour. The process concluded early in Maoist-hit areas. The third and final phase of Bihar polls  for 78 seats  is on November 7.  Stakes were also high in Madhya Pradesh  which saw roughly 70% voting with sporadic incidents of violence reported from some areas in the Gwalior-Chambal region  resulting in bullet injuries to four persons. In the 2018 assembly elections  73.39% polling was reported from these constituencies.  “The polling was peaceful. The incidents of violence mainly took place away from the polling centres. The voter turnout was good in view of Covid situation. During polling 44 ballot units  37 control units and 155 VVPAT machines had to be replaced ” said additional chief electoral officer  Madhya Pradesh  Arun Kumar Tomar.  The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) needs eight seats to maintain its majority in the assembly.  The commission said Chhattisgarh recorded 71.99% turnout  Gujarat 58.58%  Haryana 68% and Jharkhand 62.51%. Polling in Odisha stood at 68.08%  Nagaland at 83.69%  and Telangana at 83%. Eight assembly seats in Gujarat  seven in Uttar Pradesh  two each in Odisha  Nagaland  Karnataka and Jharkhand  and one each in Chhattisgarh  Telangana and Haryana went to the polls on Tuesday. Their results  along with that for Bihar  will be out on November 10.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/india-gets-through-biggest-poll-day-in-covid-19-shadow/story-qTRXnq2o5Z649TSQGu7g4J.html

Speaking at the think tank Policy Exchange in London on the theme “India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific”  Shringla outlined New Delhi’s plans to work with other countries across the region to ensure a rules-based order  maritime security and stability. “The Indo-Pacific ocean system carries an estimated 65 percent of world trade and contributes 60 percent of global GDP. Ninety percent of India’s international trade travels on its waters  he said  noting that the shift in the economic trajectory from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific has been “hugely consequential”. He added  “The rise of China and the imperative for a global rebalancing have added to the mix. A rules-based international order is achievable only with a rules-based Indo-Pacific.” India  he said  will work for an “Indo-Pacific guided by norms and governed by rules  with freedom of navigation  open connectivity  and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states”. Also read: Military talks with China to resolve border row likely on November 6 Shringla  who is in the UK as part of a three-nation tour that also took him to France and Germany  focused on the growing cooperation between India and its neighbours as well as countries such as the US  Australia and Japan across the Indo-Pacific  both to protect freedom of navigation and to boost trade. “We have sought to strengthen security and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a net security provider – for instance in peacekeeping efforts or anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden ” he said. In the past six years  India has provided coastal surveillance radar systems to Mauritius  Seychelles  Sri Lanka  the Maldives  Myanmar and Bangladesh  and all these countries  as well as Mozambique and Tanzania  use Indian-made patrol boats  he said. Mobile defence training teams have been deputed to 11 countries  from Vietnam to South Africa and Myanmar  and the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region has enhanced maritime domain awareness among partners. India has also developed capacities for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR)  and notable missions in the Indo-Pacific included “Operation Rahat” in Yemen in 2015  when India evacuated 6 710 people  including 1 947 citizens of more than 40 countries. Amid the pandemic  India sent rapid response medical teams to countries as far apart as Kuwait and the Maldives and maintained food supply lines for Gulf nations and smaller island states such as Seychelles and Comoros. In a tacit reference to China’s Belt and Road Initiative  Shringla said India has promoted infrastructure  connectivity  economic projects and supply chains while “prioritising the needs of the host community and the ethic of equity  environmental sustainability and social viability”. Like Germany  India too believes in fair competition  avoiding over-indebtedness on the part of recipient countries and ensuring transparency and sustainability while developing connectivity  he added. For India  the Indo-Pacific stretches from the western coast of North America to the eastern shores of Africa  and the country’s strategy for the region was spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech in Singapore in 2018 as the “SAGAR” or “security and growth for all in the region” doctrine  Shringla said. This includes securing supply chains  “no disproportionate dependence on a single country” and ensuring prosperity for all stakeholder nations ” he said.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-foreign-secretary-s-london-speech-a-message-on-indo-pacific-rise-of-china/story-9uxldjI0VFr2fibN2EXJeL.html

Tripathy also pointed out that the international experience shows that the coming winter season may see further spread of the pandemic. It is generally observed that elderly people  children  persons with comorbidities and others develop respiratory problems during winter  he said. This apart  the air pollution  higher concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the air aggravates the respiratory problems. “It is a well-known fact that burning of the fire crackers releases copious amounts of harmful chemicals like nitrous oxide  sulphur dioxide  carbon monoxide  which have severe impact on the respiratory health of vulnerable groups ” he said.   Such pollutants can further aggravate health conditions of Covid-19 positive persons besides persons staying in home isolation  he said.

03/11/2020,technology,Hindustan Times,India,china;australia;india;japan;united states,Military talks with China to resolve border row likely on November 6,The eighth round of talks will be led for the first time by the new commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps  Lieutenant General PGK Menon.,Talks with China to reduce friction in the sensitive eastern Ladakh theatre may resume soon  with the eighth round of military dialogue between the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) expected to take place this week  officials familiar with the ongoing border row said on Tuesday.  There are indications that the dialogue could take place along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chushul sector on November 6  the officials said.  Indian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12  with the Indian side demanding comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre.  The eighth round of talks will be led for the first time by the new commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps  Lieutenant General PGK Menon.  Both armies are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are likely to hold forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. India has made vigorous attempts to provide logistics support to its forward deployed soldiers  including the supply of specialised winter clothing sourced from the United States  the officials said. India has imported more than 15 000 sets of extended cold weather clothing system (ECWCS) from the US  with the emergency supply made by activating the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (LEMOA)  the officials said.  India signed the LEMOA  the first of the three foundational agreements proposed by Washington to deepen bilateral military cooperation  with the US in August 2016.  Defence minister Rajnath Singh had on October 28 said that talks with China for peaceful resolution of the border crisis would continue even as Indian troops are “standing firm” in forward areas. Addressing the army’s top leadership during the army commanders’ conference last month  Singh said that soldiers would be equipped with best weapons and gear to carry out their duties.  The border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have yielded no results. The latest round of military talks comes at a time when China is closely tracking the Malabar exercise  kicked off by the navies of India  United States  Japan and Australia in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday amid Chinese sabre-rattling in the Indo-Pacific region. The 24th edition of the Malabar exercise is being held in two phases - the first phase in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and the second phase to be held off India’s west coast in mid-November.  China has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India  the US  Australia and Japan  and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-talks-with-china-to-resolve-border-row-likely-on-november-6/story-soLF49XVH1Q9yNewW2jShJ.html

He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.,Citing the December 2018 judgement on the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya  the Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday rejected objections by diamantaire Nirav Modi’s defence team on admitting evidence submitted by the Indian government in the latter’s extradition case. District judge Samuel Goozee said he was bound by the Mallya judgement delivered by Emma Arbuthnot  who also dealt with the issue of admissibility of India’s evidence and decided to accept them. He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”. Modi’s lawyer Claire Montgomery  who also appeared for Mallya  raised objections on the admissibility of witness statements made under section 161 of the Indian Penal Code  among others. She also referred to remarks on the admissibility issue by legal expert Martin Lau  who was a witness presented by Modi’s team. Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case  including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi. Modi  who is lodged in the Wandsworth jail  is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the other by the Enforcement Directorate. Charges against Modi involve a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11 300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB  through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case  relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). Further hearings are scheduled in early December and on January 7  8 for final submissions. The magistrates court cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down  but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process  widely believed to be an application for asylum.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-evidence-on-nirav-modi-admissible-uk-court/story-lgUBChHht4toLFozSvjBVP.html

In an interactive session with the youth wing of her party  she asked them to remain ready to fight for the “basic rights  integrity and injustice”  especially the decisions taken after August 5  2019. Since her release after 14 months in detention  it was the PDP chief’s first interaction with the party’s youth arm at her residence  where she asked them about the situation in their respective areas. Extending their support to her  the youth leaders of the party said they will fight against the new laws and will never accept the unilateral changes made by the Centre after the scrapping of Article 370. Mehbooba later said that selected youth were called by the party for the special meet. “I wanted to hear from the youth about the political and economic situation in their areas.” People have been facing a lot of hardships since August 5 last year when the special powers of J&K were removed  said Mehbooba. “The central government’s policy since then has been anti-people and anti-J&K. Recently  it (government) introduced the provision to prematurely retire government employees after 22 years of service. The new land laws and domicile law were also discussed in this interaction ” she told the media. She told the youth that PDP will be on the forefront to face any situation. “I will be leading the youth in this fight. We have already fought with the task force  surrendered militants and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). Today  our fight is for our own integrity and for resolution of the Kashmir issue. I will fight for the future of the youth.” Ever since Mehbooba’s release from detention  the PDP workers have been actively organising meetings and protests both in Kashmir and Jammu  despite many senior PDP leaders leaving the party.

The 2021 Bengal assembly polls  due in April-May  has assumed significance for the BJP as it will try to cash in on its growing prominence in state politics  while Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will seek to return to power for the third straight time. The saffron party after having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades  has emerged as the main rival of the TMC by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general election. With the BJP’s strength increasing in the state in the last few years  where it has never been in power  its leaders are upbeat that the party will end the TMC’s 10-year-long rule.,https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amit-shah-to-commence-2-day-bengal-visit-from-thursday/story-tEaO9k8SdJWnKbMowPnrCN.html
